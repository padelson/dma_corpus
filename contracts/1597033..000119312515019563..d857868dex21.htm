former Service Provider involved in the creation of Acquired Intellectual
Property owned by the Sellers to execute work-for-hire, assignment, invention
assignment, proprietary information, and confidentiality agreements (as
applicable) to protect such Acquired Intellectual Property. Without limiting
the foregoing, all Service Providers that have created, invented or improved
any Acquired Intellectual Property owned by the Sellers used or held for use
by any Seller have executed valid and binding agreements in which they have
irrevocably assigned (as opposed to only having agreed at some future date to
assign) exclusive ownership of all of their rights in and to such Intellectual
Property to such Seller. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, no party to any such
agreement is in material breach thereof.

(including any claim that any Seller must license or refrain from using any
Intellectual Property of any third Person), (y) challenging any SellerÂ’s
rights in the Acquired Intellectual Property owned by the Sellers, including
the right to use, transfer or license any such Acquired Intellectual Property,
or (z) challenging the validity or enforceability of any Acquired Intellectual
Property owned by the Sellers.

(f) _No Third Party Infringers_. Other than pursuant to a Material Contract,
no other Person has the right to use any Registered Trademarks on the goods
and/or services in connection with which they are now being used either in
identical form or in such near resemblance thereto as to be likely, when
applied to the goods or services of any such Person, to cause confusion with
such Registered Trademarks. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, no other Person
is engaging in any activity or using any Intellectual Property that infringes
upon, misappropriates or otherwise violates any of the Acquired
Intellectual Property owned by the Sellers.

(g) _No Order_. There are no forbearances to sue, consents, settlement
agreements, judgments, orders or similar litigation-related, inter-partes or

takes and has taken commercially reasonable measures to ensure that Personal
Data is protected against unauthorized access, use, modification, disclosure
or other misuse. Any Personal Data transmitted to third parties over external
networks is transmitted in an encrypted manner. No claim or other Action
relating to any improper Data Handling, or a breach in the security, of any
Personal Data has been asserted, or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, is
threatened against any Seller. The Sellers have at all times made all
disclosures to users or customers required by applicable Privacy Laws and

To the Knowledge of the

 



17  Sellers, there have been no unauthorized processing or disclosures of access

Data. The transactions contemplated hereby will not violate any Privacy Law,
contractual obligations and customer facing terms of use and privacy policies
or other Law relating to Personal Data or Data Handling.

cease to be valid and enforceable, or (iv) or give any other Person the right
or option to cause or assert, breach of any Contract covering any Acquired
Intellectual Property; except, in each case, as would not be reasonably be

prior to the date hereof, Buyer will be permitted to cause to be exercised all
of the rights of the Sellers under the Acquired Intellectual Property to the
same extent the Sellers would have been able had the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement not occurred. Following the Closing, except as otherwise
restricted pursuant to the terms of any Contract covering any
Acquired Intellectual Property or pursuant to a Contract binding on Buyer or
its Affiliates prior to the date hereof, all Acquired Intellectual Property
will be fully transferable, alienable or licensable by Buyer without
restriction and without payment of any kind to any third-party. As used in
this _Section 3.13(j)_, an "incremental" right, non-compete, restriction,
royalty or discount refers to a right, non-compete, restriction, royalty or
discount, as applicable, in excess of the rights, non-competes, restrictions,
royalties or discounts payable that would have been required to be offered or

the Internal Revenue Service or is the subject of a favorable opinion letter
from the Internal Revenue Service

 



19  on the form of such Seller Plan and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, there
are no facts or circumstances that would be reasonably likely to adversely
affect the qualified status of any such Seller Plan. Each trust established
in connection with any Seller Plan which is intended to be exempt from federal
income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code is so exempt, and no fact or
event has occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
exempt status of any such trust.

Affiliate thereof maintains, sponsors or contributes to, or has at any time

whether fixed or contingent, with respect to (i) a multiemployer plan (within
the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA), (ii) a single employer plan or other
pension plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code, (iii) a plan maintained by more than one
employer (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code), or (iv) a
multiple employer welfare arrangement (within the meaning of Section 3(40) of
ERISA), in each of (i) through (iv), with respect to which Buyer or any of its
affiliates may have any Liability after the Closing.

which Buyer or any of its affiliates may have any Liability after the Closing
to provide (whether under an Seller Plan or otherwise) health, accident,
disability, life insurance, death or other welfare benefits to any current or
former Service Provider (or any spouse, beneficiary or dependent of the
foregoing) beyond the termination of service or retirement of such Service
Provider, other than as required under Section 4980B of the Code or any
similar applicable Law.

 

(d) _Certain Payments_. Except as set forth on _Section 3.15(f) of the
Disclosure Schedules_, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or
in combination with another event (whether contingent or otherwise) will (i)
entitle any current Service Provider to any payment; (ii) increase the amount
of compensation or benefits due to any such Service Provider or any such group
of Service Providers; or (iii) accelerate the vesting, funding or time of
payment of any compensation, equity award or other benefit. 

3.16 _Transactions with Certain Persons_. Except as set forth on _Section
3.16_ of the Disclosure Schedules, no equityholder or Representative of any

officer, director, trustee or partner; (b) been engaged in competition with
the Business; or (c) had business dealings or a material financial interest
in any transaction with any Seller with respect to the Business (other than

indirect ownership of equity interests in any Seller).

3.17  _Certain Payments_. During the past five (5) years, no such Seller, nor
any of its Representatives or any other Person affiliated with or acting for
or on behalf of such Seller, has directly or indirectly, with respect to the
Business, made any contribution, gift, bribe, rebate, payoff, influence
payment, kickback or other payment to any Person, private or public,
regardless of form, whether in money, property or services (i) to obtain
favorable treatment in securing business, (ii) to pay for favorable treatment
for business secured, or (iii) to obtain special

 



20  concessions or for special concessions already obtained, for or in respect
of any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, in each case described in
clauses (i)-(iii) in violation of any Laws (including the United States
Foreign Corrupt PracticesÂ’ Act, as amended, and any similar Law of any
jurisdiction in which the Business is conducted). No Seller has participated,
directly or indirectly, in any boycotts or other similar practices affecting
any of the actual or potential customers or advertisers of the Business.

3.18 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Each of the Sellers has timely filed or caused to be timely filed with the
appropriate Governmental Authorities all material Tax Returns required to be
filed with respect to the Acquired Assets and the Business. All such Tax
Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects. All material
Taxes owed by each Seller with respect to the Acquired Assets and the
Business (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been paid. None of the
Sellers is currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to
file any such Tax Return. For each Seller, no claim has ever been made by a
Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction in which the Seller does not file a
Tax Return that the Seller is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction with respect to the Acquired Assets or the Business.

 

(b) There are no disputes, claims, audits, investigations, notices of
deficiency or assessments concerning any Tax Liability of any Seller which
exceeds or is reasonably likely to exceed $500,000 relating to any Acquired
Assets or the Business that are pending or threatened either in writing or
otherwise to the Knowledge of the Sellers. No Seller has waived any statute of
limitations in respect of Taxes which exceed or are reasonably likely to
exceed $500,000 which waiver has not yet expired or agreed to any extension of
time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency which extension has not
yet run, in each case, relating to any Acquired Asset or the Business.

(c) There is no Encumbrance for Taxes on or against any Acquired Assets, other
than for Permitted Encumbrances.

(d) No Acquired Asset (i) is property required to be treated as owned by
another person pursuant to the provisions of Section 168(f)(8) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended and in effect immediately prior to
the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, (ii) constitutes "tax-exempt use

within the meaning of Section 467 of the Code.

(e) None of the transactions contemplated hereby are subject to withholding
under Section 1445 of the Code.

(f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or in
combination with another event (whether contingent or otherwise) will result
in or could properly be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" under
Section 280G of the Code or any corresponding provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law.

vendor during such period. Since November 30, 2014, there has been no material
adverse change in the business relationships of any Seller with any current
vendor named or required to be named on _Section 3.19(a)_ of the Disclosure
Schedules. Since November 30, 2014 through the date of this Agreement, no

to any Seller relating to the Business.

written communication from any current third party revenue source named or
required to be named on _Section 3.19(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedules of any
intention to terminate or materially reduce purchases of services or products
from any Seller relating to the Business.

3.20 _No Brokers_. None of the Sellers nor any of their respective
equityholders, Representatives or Affiliates have employed or made any
agreement with any broker, finder or similar agent or any person or firm which
will result in the obligation of the Sellers, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates to pay any finderÂ’s fee, brokerage fees or commission or similar

ARTICLE V

_COVENANTS_

 

The Sellers and Buyer each covenant and agree with the other as follows:

 

5.1 _Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition_.

 

(a) _Confidentiality_. Each of the Sellers acknowledges that it has had access
to Confidential Information and that such Confidential Information is
confidential and proprietary to the Business and constitutes valuable trade
secrets of the Business, which affect, among other things, the successful
conduct, furtherance and protection of the Business and related goodwill. Each
of the Sellers acknowledges that the unauthorized use or disclosure of such
Confidential Information is likely to be highly prejudicial to the interests
of Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective customers, partners, vendors,
advertisers, and other third party service providers, an invasion of privacy,
or an improper disclosure of trade secrets. Each of the Sellers agrees that a
substantial portion of the Purchase Price is being paid for (and that the
Assumed Liabilities are being assumed in partial consideration for) such
Confidential Information and that it represents a substantial investment
having great economic and commercial value to Buyer and its Affiliates, and
constitutes a substantial part of the value to Buyer and its Affiliates of
the Acquired Assets and the Business. Each of the Sellers further acknowledges
that Buyer and its Affiliates and the Business would be irreparably damaged if
any of the Confidential Information was disclosed to, or used or exploited on
behalf of, any Person other than Buyer and its Affiliates. During the period
beginning on the date hereof and ending on the five (5) year anniversary of
the date hereof, each of the Sellers covenants and agrees that it shall
not, directly or indirectly, and shall cause any Affiliates and any other
Persons acting on such SellerÂ’s behalf not to, without the prior written
consent of Buyer, disclose, use, exploit, furnish or make accessible to anyone
or any other Person, any such Confidential Information, except to the extent
such disclosure or use is required by applicable Law or Court Order (in which
event such Seller shall, to the extent practicable, inform Buyer in advance of
any such required disclosure, shall cooperate with Buyer in all reasonable
ways in obtaining a protective order or other protection in respect of such
required use or disclosure, and shall limit such use or disclosure to the
extent reasonably possible while still complying with such requirements).

(b) _Non-Solicitation_.

 



23 (i) Each Seller shall not and each Seller shall cause its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, on behalf of itself or any other Person solicit or
attempt to solicit during the period beginning on the date hereof and ending
on the thirty-month anniversary of the date hereof (the " _Restricted Period_
"), the employment of any Transferred Employee or otherwise encourage,
induce, solicit or attempt to encourage, induce or solicit any Transferred
Employee to leave the employment of or engagement with Buyer or any of its
Affiliates; and

 

(ii) Each of the parties agree that during the period beginning on the date
hereof and ending on the one-year anniversary of the date hereof, Buyer and
each Seller (Buyer on the one hand, and each Seller, on the other hand, each
an " _Employer_ " with respect to its Restricted Employee) shall not and shall
cause their respective Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, on behalf
of itself or any other Person solicit or attempt to solicit, the employment of
any Restricted Employee or otherwise encourage, induce, solicit or attempt to
encourage, induce or solicit any Restricted Employee to leave the employment
of or engagement with Buyer or any of its Affiliates; provided, however, the
foregoing restrictions in clauses (i) and (ii) shall not apply to (A) any
general advertisement or use of search firms or recruiters (or hiring as a
result thereof) which is not directed at Transferred Employees or Restricted
Employees or (B) the hiring of any Transferred Employee or Restricted Employee
with the prior written consent of Buyer or Seller as the case may be. For
purposes of this  _Section 5.1(b)(ii)_, the term " _Restricted Employee_ "
shall mean any employee of Employer with whom the other party had contact
during the course of the Marketing Agreement or during the negotiation of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

(c) _Non-Competition_. Each Seller agrees that during the Restricted Period,
such Seller shall not (and shall not take any steps toward or preparations in
respect of) and shall cause its Affiliates not to (or take any steps toward or
preparations in respect of), directly or indirectly (including through any
other Seller or Affiliate), either for itself or for any other Person, own,
manage, control or in any other manner engage in a Competing Business;
_provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to or in any way restrict (i)
being the owner of an aggregate of not more than five percent (5%) of the
outstanding equity securities of a publicly traded company, (ii) acquiring any
business or interest in any entity (the " _Acquired Business_ "), part of
which comprises a Competing Business, where the Competing Business forming
part of the Acquired Business was not the principal reason for the acquisition
(and in any event represents less than 15% of the total revenues underlying
such acquisition) but was merely incidental thereto, (iii) the businesses of
lastminute.com LLC or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or (iv) doing
business with a Competing Business in connection with the following business
units of Parent and its Affiliates (other than Seller): travel
network, hospitality solutions and airline solutions, in each case, as
described in the most recently filed Form S-1 or annual report on Form 10-K of
Sabre Corporation (" _Holdings_ "). For purposes of this _Section 5.1(c)_,
the term " _Competing Business_ " means an online travel agency which
provides services of the type provided by the Business and which is directed
at retail consumers.

 

(d) Each Seller hereby expressly acknowledges that (i) the covenants contained
in _Sections 5.1(a)-(c)_ are integral to the purchase of the Acquired Assets
and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by Buyer and that without the
protection of such covenants, Buyer would not have entered into this
Agreement, (ii) sufficient consideration has been given by each party to this
Agreement to the other as it relates hereto and such Seller will receive
significant benefits in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) the restrictions and agreements applicable to such Seller
in this Agreement are reasonable in all respects (including subject matter
and time period), and are necessary for the protection and preservation of
Buyer and the Business and that, without such protection, BuyerÂ’s and the 

 



24  BusinessÂ’ customer and vendor relationships and competitive advantages would
be materially and adversely affected, (iv) that money damages will be
impossible to calculate and may not adequately compensate Buyer in connection
with an actual or threatened breach by such Seller or any of its Affiliates of
the provisions of _Sections 5.1(a)-(c)_ and that Buyer shall be entitled to
obtain, in addition to all other remedies permitted under this Agreement,
specific performance of such SellerÂ’s obligations contained in _Sections
5.1(a)-(c)_ in accordance with _Section 7.14_ hereof. Further, if at any
time the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the
restrictions in this Agreement are unreasonable under circumstances then
existing, the parties hereto agree that the maximum period, scope or
geographical area reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted
for the stated period, scope or area and that this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified to cover such maximum period, scope or area. Each
Seller hereby expressly waives any right to assert inadequacy of consideration
as a defense to enforcement of the covenants in _Sections 5.1(a)-(c)_ should
such enforcement ever become necessary. In addition, in the event of a breach
of _Sections 5.1(b)_ or _5.1(c)_ , the Restricted Period shall be tolled
until such breach has been duly cured.

(e) _No-Hire_. Buyer agrees that, for the period commencing on the Closing and
expiring on the six-month anniversary of the Closing, in connection with the
Business or in connection with the Expedia-branded business, neither it nor
any of its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment,
make an offer of employment, employ or enter into any similar arrangement
with any Employee set forth on _Schedule 5.1(e)_.

5.2 _Further Assurances_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
contained herein, the parties hereto agree, (i) to use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and (ii) to execute any documents, instruments or conveyances of
any kind which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to carry out any of
the transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder.

5.3 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The Purchase Price (plus any Assumed Liabilities, to the extent properly
taken into account under the Code), shall be allocated among the Acquired
Assets and the covenant not to compete contained in _Section 5.1(c)_ in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign
Law, as appropriate) (the " _Allocation_ "). A preliminary Allocation shall
be delivered by Parent (on behalf of the Sellers) to Buyer within forty-five
(45) days after the date hereof for BuyerÂ’s review and comment. Buyer
shall provide its comments to the preliminary Allocation within fifteen (15)
days after receipt thereof. Buyer and the Sellers will work in good faith and
in an expedient manner to resolve any disputes with respect to the preliminary
Allocation and reach agreement on the Allocation within sixty (60) days. If
Buyer and Parent are unable to resolve any such dispute, such dispute shall be
resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth on _Schedule 5.3(a)_. If
the Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to this Agreement, the Allocation
shall be adjusted in a manner consistent with the procedures set forth above
or otherwise as mutually agreed by Buyer and Parent (on behalf of the
Sellers).

 

(b) Buyer and the Sellers (and their Affiliates) shall file all Tax Returns
(including IRS Form 8594) consistent with the Allocation to the extent
permitted under applicable Tax Law. Neither Buyer nor the Sellers (or their
Affiliates) shall take any Tax position inconsistent with such Allocation, and
neither Buyer nor the Sellers (or their Affiliates) 

 



25  shall agree to any proposed adjustment to the Allocation by any Governmental
Authority without first giving the other party prior written notice;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyer or
the Sellers (or their Affiliates) from settling any proposed deficiency or
adjustment by any Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of the
Allocation, and neither Buyer nor the Sellers (or their Affiliates) shall be
required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by
any Governmental Authority challenging such Allocation. Not later than thirty

and any Property Taxes that are TSM Taxes attributable to the TSM Pre-Closing
Tax Period for which the Sellers are liable under the Marketing Agreement, and
Buyer shall be responsible for all Property Taxes levied with respect to the
Acquired Assets attributable to any Post-Closing Tax Period and any Property
Taxes that are TSM Taxes attributable to the TSM Pre-Closing Tax Period for
which Buyer is liable under the Marketing Agreement. All Property Taxes levied
with respect to the Acquired Assets for a Straddle Period shall be
apportioned between Buyer and the Sellers based on the number of days of such
Straddle Period included in the portion constituting a Pre-Closing Tax Period
and the number of days of such Straddle Period included in the
portion constituting a Post-Closing Tax Period. The Sellers shall be liable
for the proportionate amount of such Property Taxes attributable to the
portion of such Straddle Period constituting a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and
Buyer shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such Property Taxes
that is attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period constituting a
Post-Closing Tax Period; provided, however, that to the extent any Straddle
Period includes the TSM Pre-Closing Tax Period, TSM Taxes for such portion of
the Straddle Period that includes the TSM Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
allocated among Buyer and the Sellers in accordance with the Marketing
Agreement, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section
5.3_, the provisions of the Marketing Agreement shall control to the extent
any Property Taxes are TSM Taxes attributable to the TSM Pre-Closing Tax
Period, including the portion of a Straddle Period that includes the TSM Pre-
Closing Tax Period. Upon receipt of any bill for such Property Taxes, Buyer or
Seller, as applicable, shall present a statement to the other setting forth
the amount of reimbursement to which each is entitled under this  _Section
5.3(c)_ together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to
calculate the proration amount. The proration amount shall be paid by the
party owing it to the other within ten (10) days after delivery of
such statement. In the event that Buyer or the Sellers make any payment for
which it is entitled to reimbursement under this _Section 5.3(c)_, the
applicable party shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no event later
than ten (10) days after the presentation of a statement setting forth the
amount of reimbursement to which the presenting party is entitled along with
such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of
reimbursement.

 

(d) Buyer and the Sellers each agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to
the other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and

to Books and Records, as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax

any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any
Governmental Authority and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or
proceeding relating to any Tax; _provided_ that Buyer will not be permitted to

date of any relevant Final Determination with respect to Taxes. Buyer and the
Sellers shall each cooperate fully with each other in the conduct of any
audit, litigation or other proceeding relating to Taxes involving the Acquired
Assets, the Business or the Allocation.

 

(e) Each of the Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer in writing (i) upon
receipt by such Person of any pending or threatened Tax inquiries, claims,
audits or assessments or (ii) prior to the decision by Sellers to pursue any
"VDA" (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, or
decision to pursue a VDA, a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") relating to the income,
properties or operations of such Person that may reasonably be expected to
relate to or give rise to an Encumbrance, restriction or limitation on use
upon the Acquired Assets or otherwise adversely affect the Acquired Assets or
the Business with respect to any Post-Closing Tax Period or the TSM Pre-
Closing Tax Period, including any and all tax claims and assessments relating
to hotel occupancy and car rental. Each of Buyer and the Sellers shall
promptly notify the other in writing upon receipt of notice of any pending or
threatened Tax audit or assessment challenging the Allocation. Any failure to
promptly notify the other party of any Tax Proceeding shall not relieve such
other party of any Liability with respect to such Tax Proceeding except to
the extent such party was actually prejudiced as a result thereof. Buyer shall
have sole control of the conduct of all Tax Proceedings related to the
Acquired Assets or the Business, including any settlement or compromise
thereof, _provided_ , _however_ , (i) to the extent any Tax Proceeding relates
to Taxes with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Sellers shall control
such Tax Proceeding at their own expense and the Sellers (x) shall promptly
notify Buyer in writing of any such Tax Proceeding and (y) shall not settle
such Tax Proceeding in whole or in part (including entering any closing
agreements or participating in any VDA) without the prior written consent of
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or
withheld and (ii) to the extent any Tax Proceeding relates to TSM Taxes
attributable to the TSM Pre-Closing Tax Period, the provisions of Section 17.3
or 17.9 of the Marketing Agreement shall determine which party shall control
such Tax Proceeding. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of
this _Section 5.3(e)_ and _Section 6.4_, this _Section 5.3(e)_
will control. For purposes of this _Section 5.3(e)_, "VDA" means any
voluntary disclosure arrangement or proceeding or similar administrative
process.

 

(f) Seller has delivered to Buyer a properly executed affidavit prepared in

conveyance, recording and other similar Taxes (including all applicable real
estate transfer Taxes) incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") will be borne equally by
the Sellers, on one hand, and by Buyer, on the other hand. The party required
by applicable Law shall file any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer
Taxes within the time period prescribed by Law, and the Sellers or Buyer, as
the case may be, shall promptly reimburse the other party(ies) for any
Transfer Taxes paid by the other party(ies) (or their Affiliates) for which
the Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, are responsible hereunder upon
receipt of written notice that such Transfer Taxes are so payable.

 



27 (i) Until the date that is seven (7) years from the date hereof, Seller shall
not under the corporate, limited liability company or partnership laws of the
relevant state liquidate, or cause to be liquidated, Seller; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller shall not liquidate, or cause to be liquidated prior
to the date that is ten (10) years from the date hereof, if there is any
Action pending or if there are any open Tax audits or unpaid assessments
related to Taxes with respect to Seller.

 

(j) Any payments made to any party pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ shall
constitute an adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and shall be
treated as such by Buyer and the Sellers on their Tax Returns to the extent
permitted by applicable Law.

5.4  _Employee Matters_.

(a) _Offers of Employment_. _Schedule 5.4(a_ ) sets forth the Employees (the "
_Potential Employees_ "). Buyer shall make formal offers of employment to the
Potential Employees no later than the date next-following the Closing Date
(the " _Offer Date_ "), with such offers to remain open until the close of
business, Dallas, TX local time, on Monday, January 26, 2015. Each such offer
of employment shall provide for employment (i) at a base salary or wage rate

such Potential Employee immediately prior to the Closing as set forth in a
schedule previously provided to Buyer in folder VIII in the virtual data room,
(ii) at an annual cash bonus incentive opportunity that is no less favorable

2014 as set forth in a schedule previously provided to Buyer in folder VIII in
the virtual data room and (iii) in a position reasonably commensurate with
such Potential EmployeeÂ’s skill set as determined by Buyer in good faith. The
Sellers shall cooperate with and use their commercially reasonable efforts to

Employee that accepts an offer of employment with Buyer or its Affiliates,
whether upon or following the Closing, the Sellers shall terminate for all
purposes (including under all Seller Plans) the employment of each such
Employee, effective (i) immediately prior to the Closing for those
Employees who commence employment with Buyer or its Affiliates at Closing,
and (ii) immediately prior to commencing employment with Buyer or its
Affiliates for those Employees who commence employment with Buyer or its
Affiliates after Closing. Each Employee who so commences employment with
Buyer or an Affiliate thereof, whether upon or following the Closing, shall
hereinafter be referred to as a " _Transferred Employee_ " as of the Closing.

 

(b) _No Severance Obligations_. Buyer and the Sellers intend that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not result in a severance
of employment of any Transferred Employee for purposes of any Seller Plan and
that the Transferred Employees will have continuous and uninterrupted
employment for such purposes immediately before and immediately after the date
hereof, and Buyer and the Sellers shall make reasonable efforts to ensure the
same. In furtherance of the foregoing, as of and after the Closing, Buyer
shall, to the extent permitted under the applicable plan, policy or
arrangement, give each Transferred Employee full credit for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and level of benefits under each employee
benefit plan, policy or arrangement (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
any equity compensation or other incentive plans or programs) maintained by
Buyer in which the Transferred Employees participate following the Closing
(each, a " _Buyer Plan_ ") for such Transferred EmployeeÂ’s service prior to
the Closing with Seller and its Affiliates and predecessor entities, to the
same extent such service is recognized by Seller immediately prior to the
Closing (other than as would result in a duplication of benefits or for
purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan).
With respect to each Buyer Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined
in Section 3(1) of ERISA), to the extent permitted under the terms of the

 



28  applicable Buyer Plan, Buyer or its Affiliates shall (i) cause there to be
waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations or exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements, evidence of insurability and required physical
examinations with respect to the Transferred Employees and their eligible
dependents (except to the extent such limitations, exclusions or requirements
would have applied under comparable Seller Plans) and (ii) give credit, in
the year in which the Closing occurs, for purposes of satisfying any
deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, for all claims incurred and
amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Transferred Employees and
their eligible dependents under comparable Seller Plans in which the
Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents participated during the
plan year in which the Closing occurs (to the extent such credit would have
been given under comparable Seller Plans prior to the date hereof).

(c) _Accrued Bonuses_. The Sellers shall pay to each Transferred Employee at
such time as the 2014 annual bonuses are paid to employees generally in
accordance with the applicable Seller Plan, but in no event later than March
15, 2015, such Transferred EmployeeÂ’s annual bonus for 2014 services. The
amount of the annual bonus paid to each Transferred Employee shall be based
upon the target bonus set forth opposite such Transferred EmployeeÂ’s name on
_Schedule 5.4(a)_ and determined by reference to attainment of applicable 2014
employer and individual performance objectives, as determined in accordance
with the applicable Seller Plan (disregarding any continued employment
obligations that may apply to any such bonuses). In addition, at Closing or at
the SellersÂ’ first payroll run following Closing, Sellers shall pay to each
Transferred Employee any other bonus amount to which such Transferred Employee
is entitled in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall
any annual bonus or other incentive or bonus payable in accordance with this
Section 5.4(c) be reduced or adversely affected, in any case, by reason of the
Transferred EmployeeÂ’s termination of employment with Sellers
and/or commencement of employment with Buyer in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) _Paid Time Off; Vacation_. Upon each Transferred EmployeeÂ’s termination
of employment in accordance with _Section 5.4(a),_ the Sellers shall pay to
such Transferred Employee the full balance of his or her accrued vacation and
paid time off as of such termination date if and to the extent required by
applicable Laws.

(e) _WARN Act_. Without limiting any other provision hereof, the Sellers
shall be solely responsible for complying with the Worker Adjustment
Retraining and Notification Act of 1988, as amended (the " _WARN Act_ ") and
any and all obligations under other applicable regulations requiring notice
of plant closings, relocations, mass layoffs, reductions in force or similar
actions (and for any failures to so comply), in any case, applicable to the
Employees as a result of any action by any Seller on or prior to the Closing,
or following the Closing with respect to any Employee who does not become a
Transferred Employee for any reason. The Sellers shall indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and its Affiliates against any and all liabilities arising in
connection with any failure of Seller to comply with the foregoing
requirements of this _Section 5.4(e) _as a result of any action by any Seller
on or prior to the Closing or, following the Closing, in respect of Employees
who do not become Transferred Employees. In addition, Buyer shall be solely
responsible for complying with the WARN Act with respect to Transferred
Employees following the Closing, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers
and their Affiliates against any and all liabilities arising in
connection with any failure to comply with such requirements.

 



29 (f) _Cooperation_. The parties shall reasonably cooperate to effect the intent
of this  _Section 5.4_ (including sharing relevant information to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law and reasonably requested by the other party).

 

(g) _No Third Party Beneficiaries; No Continued Service or Service Terms_. The
provisions of this _Section 5.4_ are solely for the benefit of the
respective parties to this Agreement and nothing in this _Section 5.4_,
express or implied, shall confer upon any employee, consultant, manager or
other service provider (or any dependent, successor, legal representative or
beneficiary thereof), any rights or remedies, including any right to
continuance of employment or any other service relationship with Buyer or any
of its Affiliates, or any right to compensation or benefits of any nature or
kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 5.4_, express
or implied, shall be: (i) an amendment or deemed amendment of any plan
providing benefits to any employee, or (ii) construed to interfere with the
right of Buyer or its Affiliates to terminate the employment or other service
relationship of any of the Transferred Employees at any time, with or without
cause, or restrict any such entity in the exercise of their independent
business judgment in modifying any of the terms and conditions of the
employment or other service arrangement of the Transferred Employees, or (iii)
deemed to obligate Buyer or its Affiliates to adopt, enter into or maintain
any employee benefit plan or other compensatory plan, program or arrangement
at any time. The Sellers acknowledge and agree that no Transferred Employee
shall be prohibited or restricted from the proper performance of duties and
responsibilities for the Buyer and/or its Affiliates following the Closing
by operation of any confidentiality, non-solicitation, non-competition,
intellectual property assignment or other restrictive covenant agreement
between such Transferred Employee and one or more of the Sellers and/or their
Affiliates, and the Sellers agree that they shall not, directly or through
one or more Affiliates, seek to restrain any such performance of duties and
responsibilities by any such Transferred Employee following the Closing.

 

5.5 _Publicity_. Except (a) as otherwise expressly contemplated by or
necessary to implement the provisions of this Agreement or required by Law,
(b) for the joint press release to be issued by the Sellers and Buyer in the
form previously agreed and (c) any press release, public statements or
disclosure by Buyer consistent with information previously disclosed
in accordance with this _Section 5.5_, neither Buyer nor the Sellers (nor
any of their respective Affiliates) shall issue any press release or otherwise
make any public statements or disclosure with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
party, except to the extent such disclosure is required by applicable Law or
the rules of any stock exchange, in which case the party seeking to make such
disclosure shall promptly notify the other party thereof and Buyer and the
Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or
announcement to be issued.

 

5.6 _Third Party Consents_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Contract, Permit, or any
claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an
attempted assignment thereof, without the consent of another Person thereto,
would constitute a Default thereunder or violation thereof, or upon
transfer would in any way adversely affect the rights of Buyer or its
Affiliates under such Contract, Permit, claim or right. If any transfer or
assignment by any Seller to Buyer or its Affiliates, or any assumption by
Buyer or its Affiliates of, any interest in, or Liability, obligation or
commitment under, any Contract, Permit, claim or right requires the consent of
another Person, then such transfer or assignment or assumption shall be made
subject to such consent being obtained.

 



30 (b) If any such consent has not been obtained prior to the Closing, the
Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to secure such
consent as promptly as practicable after the Closing and Buyer shall provide
or cause to be provided all commercially reasonable assistance to the Sellers
(not including, with respect to Buyer or the Sellers, the payment of any
consideration (unless the Buyer directs otherwise and has agreed to be
responsible therefor), the commencement of litigation or the agreement to
modifications of the terms of any underlying agreement in order to obtain any
such consents). Until any such consent is obtained, the Sellers shall provide
Buyer with the economic, claims, rights and benefits, and Buyer shall bear the
burdens and obligations, from and after the Closing (including the Assumed
Liabilities) under the Contract, Permit, claim or right as if the consent had
been obtained in accordance with this Agreement.

(c) Subject to the preceding paragraph (b), in the event that, at any time
following the Closing, the Sellers become aware (by notice from Buyer or
otherwise) that Buyer did not receive all Acquired Assets at the Closing, the
Sellers shall, at the SellersÂ’ sole cost and expense, cause the prompt
transfer of any such Acquired Assets not so received to Buyer. Prior to any
such transfer, the Sellers shall hold such Acquired Assets in trust for Buyer.
In the event that the Sellers have transferred (other than to Buyer), sold or
otherwise disposed of such Acquired Assets, the Sellers shall, at the SellersÂ’
sole cost and expense, make proper provision such that Buyer receives the
equivalent benefit of such Acquired Assets. The Sellers shall give
all reasonable assistance to Buyer (at BuyerÂ’s request) to enable Buyer to
enforce its rights under any Contract that constitutes an Acquired Asset.

 

(d) With respect to the Employee(s) named on _Schedule 1.2(i)(B)_ and for the
term set forth therein, Sellers shall cooperate with Buyer to enforce, for
the benefit of Buyer and the Business, the noncompete, nonsolicitation,
confidentiality and other restrictive covenants relating to the Acquired
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Business contained in the agreements
set forth on  _Schedule 1.2(i)(B)_ to the extent set forth therein.

5.7 _Collection of Accounts Receivable; Buyer Cash_.

 

(a) Following the Closing, in the event that any Seller receives any payments
from a third party that relate to (i) any Acquired Assets or (ii) Buyer
Receivables, such Seller shall, promptly following receipt of any such
payment, transfer such payments to Buyer or a bank account designated by
Buyer.

 

(b) Following the Closing, the amount of any Buyer Cash may be offset by Buyer
against BuyerÂ’s payment obligations pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement.

5.8 _Bulk Sales Waiver_. Subject to _Section 5.3(g)_, Buyer and the Sellers
hereby waive compliance with the terms and conditions of any applicable bulk
sales Law or similar Laws that may be applicable to the sale or transfer of
the Acquired Assets.

 

5.9 _Payment of Liabilities_. Following the Closing, the Sellers shall take
all actions necessary to pay promptly when due all Excluded Liabilities of
the Sellers pursuant to the Assumed Contracts. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, no Seller shall be liquidated or dissolved until such time
as such Liabilities have been paid or an adequate reserve has been
established therefor and no such Seller shall be wound up, liquidated or
dissolved without first complying with applicable Laws.

 



31 5.10 _Name Change_. Each Seller shall cease the use of "Travelocity" as part
of its corporate or legal name and will initiate the change in its legal name
within five (5) Business Days following the date hereof so as to not include
any of the foregoing names or any confusingly similar names (it being agreed
that use of the acronym "TVL" for internal purposes only is acceptable),
except as provided under the Transition Services Agreement.

5.11  _Access to Books and Records_. For a period of seven (7) years after
the Closing, each of the Sellers and Buyer shall, and shall cause their
respective subsidiaries to, provide to the other parties and their respective
authorized representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours,
to (i) all books, records and other documents related to the Business, (ii)
information related to the Business and (iii) employees related to the
Business (without substantial disruption of employment), in each case which
are necessary or useful in connection with any audit, investigation or
dispute, any litigation or investigation or any other matter requiring any
such books and records, information or employees for any reasonable business
purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) a party may refuse the other
partyÂ’s representatives access if such party determines such access may
unreasonably interfere with any of the businesses or operations of such party
or such partyÂ’s ability to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement; (b) a
party shall not be required to (or cause any of its subsidiaries to) so
confer, afford such access or furnish such copies or other information to the
extent that doing so would result in the breach of any confidentiality or
similar agreement to which such party or any of its subsidiaries is a party or
the loss of attorney-client privilege (provided that such party shall use
its reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner
that does not result in a breach of such agreement or a loss of attorney-
client privilege); and (c) no party shall be required to provide such access
with respect to any information, property or employees relating to a dispute
or litigation between the parties (except as required by applicable court
process). Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the Sellers or Buyer, as
the case may be, the other parties shall not, and shall cause their
respective subsidiaries not to, for a period of seven (7) years (or such
longer period as may be required by applicable Law) following the date hereof,
destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the books and records of the
Business, or any portions thereof, relating to periods prior to the date
hereof. To the extent any inconsistency exists between the provisions of this
_Section 5.9_ and the provisions of _Section 5.3(d)_,  _Section 5.3(d)_
shall control with respect to any Books and Records related to Taxes.

5.12 _Legacy Assets_.

 

(a) If, within the two (2) year period following the Closing, Buyer or any
Seller identifies any Legacy Asset that was exclusively used in the operation
of the global online travel business operated under the Transferred Brand
prior to January 29, 2014, such Seller shall notify Buyer thereof (if a Seller
identifies such Legacy Assets) or Buyer may provide notice thereof to
the Sellers. Upon receipt or delivery, as applicable, of such notice, the
Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to locate such Legacy Asset and upon
locating such Legacy Asset shall, at BuyerÂ’s election, transfer SellersÂ’
right, title and interest therein to Buyer.

(b) If, within the two (2) year period following the Closing, Buyer identifies
any Legacy Asset (other than (a) Trademarks and (b) domain names (other than
domain names that currently (i) redirect to a Transferred Brand branded domain
name or (ii) function as landing or similar pages that primarily direct
traffic to a Transferred Brand branded domain name, in each case excluding
any Sabre branded domain name)) that was used (but not exclusively used) in
the operation of the global online travel business operated under the
Transferred Brand prior to January 29, 2014, Buyer may provide notice thereof
to the Sellers. Upon receipt of such notice, the Sellers shall use reasonable
efforts to locate such Legacy Asset and upon locating such

 



32  Legacy Asset, Buyer and the Sellers shall discuss in good faith, acting
reasonably, granting Buyer access to such Legacy Asset; _provided_ , _however_
, that if such grant of access to such Legacy Asset pursuant to this _Section
5.12(b)_ would in the aggregate materially impair the value of the business of
the Sellers and their controlled Affiliates, as determined pursuant to the
Escalation Procedures, Buyer shall have no right to use such Legacy Asset.

(c) With respect to any Legacy Asset assigned to Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement consisting of source code, Buyer hereby grants to the Sellers a
non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicenseable, royalty-
free, fully-paid up license to make, use, operate, copy, modify and exploit
such Intellectual Property.

 

(d) Seller hereby grants Buyer a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid up,
worldwide license under the patents set forth on _Schedule 5.12(d)_ (the "
_Legacy Patents_ ") with the right to grant sublicenses for the term of the
last-expiring Legacy Patent to use, make, have made, sell, offer to sell, and
import products and services related to the Business. As between Seller and
Buyer, Seller shall own and retain all right, title and interest in and to the
Legacy Patents. Seller shall have the primary right but not the obligation, at
its sole cost and expense, to conduct and control the
prosecution, maintenance, and challenges against validity and
unenforceability or patentability with respect to the Legacy Patents. If Buyer
reasonably believes that Seller may fail to make any required payments or fail
to take any action required for the preparation, filing, prosecution, defense
or maintenance of any Legacy Patent, Buyer shall provide Seller with written
notice of such deficiency. If Seller fails to take the required action five
(5) Business Days before the deadline for taking such action, Buyer shall
have the right to thereafter make any such required payments or take any such
required action at its own cost and expense. If either Purchaser or a Seller
should become aware of any infringement or threatened infringement of a
Legacy Patent, it shall promptly notify the other party. Seller shall have the
initial right (but not the obligation) to bring or control, at its own
expense, any enforcement action directed to an alleged infringement. In the
event that Seller does not commence enforcement actions against the
infringement within sixty (60) days of receipt of a written request by Buyer,
then Buyer shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to enforce the
Legacy Patents on behalf of itself and Seller.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including the
representations and warranties in _Article III_ ), upon any transfer of
Legacy Assets to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, Seller shall be deemed to
make with respect to such Assets only the representations and warranties set
forth in _Sections 3.4_ and _3.8(a)_ , subject to any related disclosure,
as may be made reasonably and in good faith by Seller at the time of such
transfer; provided, however that in the event Seller makes the representations
and warranties set forth in Sections 3.4 and 3.8(a) with respect to such
Assets with related disclosure, Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take such actions to make the representations and warranties set
forth in Sections 3.4 and 3.8(a) with respect to such Assets without
related disclosure, with any dispute regarding any such actions being
resolved pursuant to the Escalation Procedures.

(f) The Sellers will renew and maintain the domain name
"sabretravelocity.com" and will not (i) direct such domain name to any active
server or page or (ii) use such domain name to host content, as a redirect, as
a landing page or otherwise.

 

5.13 _Shared Assets_.

(a) With respect to any Seller Shared Asset (other than (i) Trademarks (ii)
domain names (other than domain names that currently (A) redirect to a
Transferred Brand

 



33  branded domain name or (B) function as landing or similar pages that
primarily direct traffic to a Transferred Brand branded domain name, in each
case excluding any Sabre branded domain name or (iii) to the extent provided
as a Service (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement))) that is
necessary for the operation of the Business after the Closing, Sellers hereby
grant to Buyer a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-
free, fully-paid up license to make, use, operate, copy, modify and exploit
such Seller Shared Asset. With respect to any Seller Shared Asset (other than
(i) Trademarks and domain names (other than domain names that currently (A)
redirect to a Transferred Brand branded domain name or (B) function as landing
or similar pages that primarily direct traffic to a Transferred Brand branded
domain name, in each case excluding any Sabre branded domain name, (ii) any
Seller Shared Asset for which Buyer already has access rights pursuant to this
Agreement or (iii) to the extent provided as a Service (as defined in the
Transition Services Agreement))) that is not necessary for the operation
of the Business after the Closing, Sellers hereby grant to Buyer a non-
exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid up license for a
period of four months after such grant, to make, use, operate, copy, modify
and exploit such Seller Shared Asset; provided that if Buyer has not used for
a 14 day consecutive period such Seller Shared Asset during any period
beginning any time after the two (2) month anniversary of the grant of such
license, Seller may, acting reasonably, request that Buyer terminate such
license no earlier than one month after the date of such notice. Any
disagreement with respect to whether such termination of such license was
effected in accordance with the provisions of this  _Section 5.13(a)_ shall
be resolved pursuant to the Escalation Procedures.

(b) With respect to any Buyer Shared Asset that does not constitute
Intellectual Property, excluding any Buyer Shared Asset set forth on _Schedule
7.1(b)_ , Buyer and Sellers shall discuss in good faith, acting reasonably, an
appropriate grant of the right to use such Buyer Shared Asset.

 

(c) With respect to any Buyer Shared Asset that constitutes Intellectual
Property necessary for the operation of any business of the Sellers or their
Affiliates (other than the Business), excluding any Buyer Shared Asset set
forth on _Schedule 7.1(b)_ , Buyer hereby grants to the Sellers a non-
exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid up
license to make, use, operate, copy, modify and exploit such Buyer Shared
Asset; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the license of such Buyer Shared Asset
pursuant to this _Section 5.13(c)_ would materially impair the value of the
Acquired Assets, as determined pursuant to the Escalation Procedures, any
such license shall terminate upon written notice to Sellers and Sellers shall
have no right to use such Buyer Shared Asset.

 

5.14 _Escrow_. If prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date
hereof, (a) the Public Debt Rating published by MoodyÂ’s is below B3 and the
Public Debt Rating published by SandP is below B- or (b) if there ceases to be a
Public Debt Rating published by at least one of SandP or MoodyÂ’s, then Seller
shall provide written notice to Buyer of such occurrence within five (5)
Business Days, and within twenty (20) Business Days of its receipt of a
written request of Buyer, shall deposit an amount equal to $35,000,000 (the "
_Escrow Amount_ ") into an escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ ")
established pursuant to the terms of an Escrow Agreement (the " _Escrow
Agreement_ ") to be entered into among Seller, Buyer and Bank of America,
N.A. (or any successor escrow agent appointed pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, as escrow agent, the " _Escrow Agent_ "), in order to support the
SellersÂ’ indemnification obligations under Article VI. The Escrow
Agreement shall remain in effect until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
date hereof (or if as of such date a claim theretofore made against the Escrow
Amount shall be pending, such later date as of which such claim is finally
resolved). Upon expiration of the Escrow Agreement, the parties to the Escrow
Agreement shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to the Sellers the remaining portion
of the Escrow Amount, subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 



34 5.15 _Straddle Claims_. The Sellers shall not assert any Straddle Claim (i)
against a Person with whom Expedia has a then-current business relationship
without the prior written consent of Buyer or unless such Straddle Claim is a
counter-claim (in the case of an indemnity claim only, such written consent
not to be unreasonably withheld) or (ii) after such Straddle Claim shall have
been asserted by Buyer.

statute of limitation, indefinitely). The Sellers shall be entitled to rely
upon the representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in this Agreement
and Buyer shall be entitled to rely on the representations and warranties of
the Sellers set forth in this Agreement. No claim for recovery of Damages
incurred in connection with, arising out of, resulting from or incident to any
breach of any representation or warranty or the inaccuracy of any
representation may be asserted by an indemnified party against an
indemnifying party after such representation or warranty shall have expired;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the termination of the representations and
warranties provided herein shall not affect the rights of a party in respect
of any indemnification claim so long as such party gives written notice to the
applicable indemnifying party with respect to such claim prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period provided for herein (and
the applicable representations and warranties shall survive with respect to

(a) Subject to the terms of this _Article VI_ , from and after the Closing,
the Sellers, jointly and severally, shall indemnify, save and hold harmless
Buyer and each of BuyerÂ’s Affiliates (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_
"), from and against any and all losses, Liabilities, claims, demands,
Actions, causes of action, costs, damages, expenses or Taxes, deficiencies or
diminution in value whether or not arising from or in connection with any
third-party claims (including interest, penalties, reasonable attorneysÂ’,

in investigation, defense or settlement of any of the foregoing)
(collectively, " _Damages_ "), to the extent incurred in connection with,
arising out of or resulting from:

 



35 (i) any breach of any representation or warranty or the inaccuracy of any
representation made by any Seller in or pursuant to _Article III_ of this
Agreement, in the Ancillary Agreements or in any certificate delivered by or
on behalf of the Sellers pursuant hereto (other than the Seller Carve-Out
Representations), in each case, without giving effect to any materiality
qualifications, Material Adverse Effect qualifications or similar phrases for
purposes of determining the Damages resulting from, arising out of or relating
to a breach (but not whether there is a breach);

 

(ii) any breach of any of the Seller Carve-out Representations or any
inaccuracy of any Seller Carve-Out Representation made by the Sellers in or
pursuant to the Agreement or any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the
Sellers pursuant hereto, in each case, without giving effect to any

Indemnitee(s) with respect to all claims of Buyer Indemnitees made under
_Section 6.2(a)(i)_ and any breach of the representations and warranties set
forth in _Section 3.13_ exceeds an accumulated total of $2,800,000 (the "
_Threshold Amount_ "); _provided_ that once the aggregate amount of such
Damages exceeds the Threshold Amount, then the Buyer Indemnitees shall have
the right to recover all Damages without regard to the Threshold Amount. No
claim for indemnification by a Buyer Indemnitee under _Section 6.2(a)(i)_
shall be asserted where the amount that would otherwise be payable by the
Sellers hereunder relating to such claim or series of related claims is less

for indemnification pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)(i)_ shall be made by the

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall the Sellers be required to indemnify, save and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnitees under this _Article VI_ or otherwise be liable in connection with
this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement,
or the transactions contemplated hereby, for any Damages that (A) are
punitive or exemplary (except to the extent such Damages

 



36  are asserted against a Buyer Indemnitee by a third party), (B) arise from
any special plans or circumstances of Buyer not known to Sellers as of the
date of this Agreement or (C) that are not otherwise reasonably foreseeable.

(v) The amount of any Damages that are payable to the Buyer Indemnitees
pursuant to this  _Section 6.2_ shall be reduced by the amount of any
insurance proceeds (net of any deductible or co-payment, such Buyer
IndemniteeÂ’s reasonable estimate of any increase in insurance premiums
attributable to such recovery and all out-of-pocket costs related to such
recovery) and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually
received by the Buyer Indemnitees in respect of such Damages or any of the
events, conditions, facts or circumstances resulting in or relating to such
Damages; provided, however, that the Buyer Indemnitees shall have no
obligation to pursue any such recovery under insurance policies or indemnity,
contribution or other similar agreements for any Damages. The Buyer
Indemnitees shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate their
respective Damages, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable
Law.

(iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made by Buyer in or pursuant to
this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement;

(iv) other than matters (a) for which a Buyer Indemnitee is entitled

37 (v) other than matters for which a Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to

6.3(a)(i)_ until the aggregate amount of Damages incurred by the Seller
Indemnitee(s) with respect to all claims of Seller Indemnitees made under
_Section 6.3(a)(i)_ exceeds the Threshold Amount; _provided_ that once the
aggregate amount of such Damages exceeds the Threshold Amount, then the Seller
Indemnitees shall have the right to recover all Damages without regard to the
Threshold Amount. No claim for indemnification by a Seller Indemnitee under
_Section 6.3(a)(i)_ shall be asserted where the amount that would otherwise
be payable by the Buyer hereunder relating to such claim or series of related
claims is less than $50,000.

 

(ii) Any amounts payable to the Seller Indemnitees in satisfaction of claims
for indemnification pursuant to _Section 6.3(a)(i)_ shall be made by Buyer;
_provided_ , that the aggregate amount of all payments made by Buyer in
satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 6.3(a)(i)_
shall not exceed the Cap.

 

(iii) The aggregate maximum indemnification obligation of Buyer for Damages
under _Sections 6.3(a)(i)_ and _6.3(a)(ii)_ shall not exceed, in the
aggregate, the Purchase Price Cap.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall the Buyer be required to indemnify, save and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnitees under this _Article VI_ or otherwise be liable in connection with
this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement,
or the transactions contemplated hereby, for any Damages that that (A) are
punitive or exemplary (except to the extent such Damages are asserted against
a Seller Indemnitee by a third party), (B) arise from any special plans or
circumstances of Sellers not known to Buyer as of the date of this Agreement
or (C) that are not otherwise reasonably foreseeable.

(vi) The amount of any Damages that are payable to the Seller Indemnitees
pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ shall be reduced by the amount of any
insurance proceeds (net of any deductible or co-payment, such Seller
IndemniteeÂ’s reasonable estimate of any increase in insurance premiums
attributable to such recovery and all out-of-pocket costs related to such
recovery) and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually
received by the Seller Indemnitees in respect of such Damages or any of the
events, conditions, facts or circumstances resulting in or relating to such
Damages; provided, however, that the Seller Indemnitees shall have no
obligation to pursue any such recovery under insurance policies or indemnity,
contribution or other similar agreements for any Damages. The Seller
Indemnitees shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate their
respective Damages, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable
Law.

 

6.4 _Defense of Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) If a claim for Damages is to be made by an Indemnitee hereunder as a
result of any Action, investigation or other claim brought by a third party
(a " _Third Party Claim_ "), (x) such Indemnitee shall, subject to this
_Article VI_ , give prompt written notice (a

 



38  " _Claim Notice_ ") to the applicable indemnifying party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), stating that an indemnification claim pursuant to
_Section 6.2(a)_ or  _Section 6.3(a)_, as applicable, is being made and
specifying in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances surrounding such
Third Party Claim (to the extent known by the Indemnitee), as well as an
estimate of the amount of Damages in respect of such claim, if such estimate
can be reasonably determined ( _provided_ , _however_ , that an Indemnitee
shall not be bound by any estimate of Damages contained in such description
and shall not lose any right to indemnification for failure to provide such
reasonable detail) as soon as practicable after such Indemnitee becomes aware
of the Third Party Claim for which indemnification may be sought under this
_Article VI_ ; _provided_ , that the failure of an Indemnitee to give prompt
notice hereunder shall not affect the rights to indemnification hereunder,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrate actual damage and
prejudice caused by such failure; and (y) the Indemnifying Party shall
be entitled, at its sole expense, to assume such defense so long as (A) such
Third Party Claim does not involve or seek any (i) non-monetary remedy or
monetary Damages reasonably likely to exceed the balance of funds then
remaining under the Cap, (ii) claims for equitable relief, (iii) potential
criminal liability, (iv) alleged breaches of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 3.8_ or (v) matters that would be reasonably
likely to establish an adverse precedential effect, generate negative
publicity, or would otherwise adversely affect a Buyer Indemnitee or the
conduct of its or its AffiliatesÂ’ business or operations (each such claim, a "
_Specified Claim_ "); and (B) the Indemnifying Party acknowledges and agrees
in writing without reservation that such Third Party Claim constitutes an
indemnifiable Damage for which the Indemnifying Party is responsible
hereunder; _provided_ ,  _further_ that the Indemnitee shall have the sole
right to control such defense if not described in clause (y) of this _Section
6.4(a)_, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is a named defendant
with respect to such Third Party Claim, in which case the Indemnifying Party
shall have the sole right to control such claim on behalf of the Indemnifying
Party (but not the Indemnitee); _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the
parties shall cooperate in good faith to implement reasonable arrangements
designed to preserve any existing attorney-client privilege. Each of the
Sellers or Buyer shall promptly notify the Sellers or Buyer, as the case may
be, upon becoming aware of any Third Party Claim asserted against any Seller
or Buyer, as the case may be, that is reasonably likely to result in Damages
for which a Seller Indemnitee or Buyer Indemnitee, as the case may be, is
entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 

(b) With respect to any Third Party Claim the defense of which the
Indemnifying Party elects to control pursuant to  _Section 6.4(a)_, the
Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) prior
to entering into a settlement in respect of such Third Party Claim. With
respect to any Third Party Claim the defense of which the Indemnitee is
entitled to control pursuant to _Section 6.4(a)_, the Indemnitee shall not be
prohibited from entering into a settlement of such Third Party Claim
without an Indemnifying PartyÂ’s consent; provided that, in such case, such
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to contest the amounts owed by such
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Third Party Claim.

 

(c) The term "Damages" as used in this _Article VI_ is not limited to matters
asserted by third parties against an Indemnitee, but includes Damages
incurred or sustained by an Indemnitee in the absence of Third Party Claims.
Payments by a party of amounts for which such party is indemnified hereunder
shall not be a condition precedent to recovery.

 

6.5 _Manner of Payment_. Any indemnification payment pursuant to this _Article
VI_ shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by the applicable Indemnitee within three (3) days after
the determination of the amount thereof, whether pursuant to a final judgment,
settlement or agreement among the parties hereto;

 



39   _provided_ , that whenever any payments are required to be made by one or
more Sellers in satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 6.2(a)_, the Buyer Indemnitees may, if the Escrow Account is funded
pursuant to _Section 5.14_, but shall not be obligated to satisfy all or any
portion of such payment obligation from the Escrow Account; _provided_ ,
_further_ that, to the extent that all or any portion of any indemnification
payment by the Sellers is to be satisfied through funds that remain available
in the Escrow Account (to the extent the Escrow Account is funded pursuant to
_Section 5.14_), Seller and Buyer shall, within three (3) days after the
determination of the amount thereof, deliver a joint written instruction to
the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release the appropriate
portion of the Escrow Amount to an account designated by Buyer. All amounts
paid by any party in respect of indemnification under this _Article VI_ shall
constitute adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and shall be
treated as such by Buyer and the applicable Seller on their Tax Returns to
the extent permitted by Law.

6.6 _Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(a) The parties hereto hereby agree that, from and after the date hereof, the
indemnification provisions set forth in  _Section 5.4(e)_ and this _Article
VI_ are the exclusive provisions in this Agreement with respect to the
liability of the parties hereto for the breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement and the sole remedy of
the Indemnitees for any claims for breach of representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement; _provided_ that nothing herein shall preclude any
party from seeking any other remedy for common law fraud or
intentional misrepresentation by any other party hereto (including any common
law fraud or intentional misrepresentation committed by any Affiliate or
Representative of Buyer or any Seller in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements).

(b) Any Damages subject to indemnification hereunder shall be determined
without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise
to such Damages.

6.7 _Right of Set-off_. To the extent that any Indemnifying Party has an
indemnification obligation as determined pursuant to this _Article VI_ , (i)
which is final and non-appealable or (ii) acknowledged in writing by such
Indemnifying Party, any of the Indemnitees may set off the amount of such
indemnification obligation against any amounts then due and unpaid to any of
the Indemnifying Parties by any of the Indemnitees within the time period
allowed for payment to such Indemnifying Party. Neither the exercise of nor
the failure to exercise such right of set-off will constitute an election of
remedies or limit any Indemnitee in any manner in the enforcement of any other
remedies that may be available to it.

7.3 _Rules of Construction; Interpretation_. The parties agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in any agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.
Where specific language is used to clarify by example a general statement
contained herein (such as by using the word "including"), such specific
language shall not be deemed to modify, limit or restrict in any manner the
construction of the general statement to which it relates. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms. Whenever required by the context, any pronoun used
in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or
neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs shall include
the plural and vice versa. The words "include" and "including," and other
words of similar import when used herein shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation but rather shall be deemed to be followed in each case by the words
"without limitation." The word "if" and other words of similar import when
used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the phrase "and
only if." The words "herein," "hereto," and "hereby" and other words of
similar import in this Agreement shall be deemed in each case to refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Article, Section or other
subdivision of this Agreement. References to Articles or Sections herein refer
to Articles or Sections of this Agreement unless otherwise specified, and
references to Schedules herein refer to the Disclosure Schedules as defined
herein. Any reference herein to "dollars" or "$" shall mean United States
dollars. The words "as of the date of this Agreement" and words of similar
import shall be deemed in each case to refer to the date this Agreement was
first signed. The term "or" shall be deemed to mean "and/or." Any reference to
any particular Law will be interpreted to include any revision of or successor
to that section regardless of how it is numbered or classified and any
reference herein to a Governmental Authority shall be deemed to include
reference to any successor thereto.

 

7.4 _Titles_. The titles, captions or headings of the Articles and Sections
herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to
be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

7.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Exhibits hereto, the
Disclosure Schedules and the other agreements, documents and written
understandings referred to herein or otherwise entered into or delivered by
the parties hereto on the date of this Agreement (including the Ancillary

all other prior covenants, agreements, undertakings, obligations, promises,
arrangements, communications, representations and warranties, whether oral or
written, by any party hereto or by any director, officer, employee, agent,
Affiliate or Representative of any party hereto.

 



53 7.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations
hereunder may be assigned by the Sellers or Buyer without the prior written

portion of its rights and obligations hereunder to (a) an Affiliate of Buyer

hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed by Buyer

7.8  _Waiver_. Except where a specific period for action or inaction is
provided herein, neither the failure nor any delay on the part of any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or the documents
referred to in this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any waiver on the part of any party of any such right, power or privilege, nor
any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such
right, power or privilege. The failure of a party to exercise any right
conferred herein within the time required shall cause such right to terminate
with respect to the transaction or circumstances giving rise to such right,
but not to any such right arising as a result of any other transactions or
circumstances.

7.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced as a result of any rule of law
or public policy, all other terms and other provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.

Agreement, with full rights of enforcement as though such Person was a
signatory to this Agreement.

7.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement (and any claim or controversy arising out

unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or, if the

agrees that the other parties would be damaged irreparably, and in a manner
for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, in the event any

specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the parties
hereto agrees that the other parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any
action instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof
