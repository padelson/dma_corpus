execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in any agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. Where
specific language is used to clarify by example a general statement contained herein (such as by using the word &#147;including&#148;), such specific language shall not be deemed to modify, limit or restrict in any manner the construction of the
general statement to which it relates. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. Whenever required by the context, any pronoun used in this Agreement shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs shall include the plural and vice versa. The words &#147;include&#148; and &#147;including,&#148; and other words of similar import when used
herein shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation but rather shall be deemed to be followed in each case by the words &#147;without limitation.&#148; The word &#147;if&#148; and other words of similar import when used herein shall be deemed in

case to refer to the date this Agreement was first signed. The term &#147;or&#148; shall be deemed to mean &#147;and/or.&#148; Any reference to any particular Law will be interpreted to include any revision of or successor to that section regardless
of how it is numbered or classified and any reference herein to a Governmental Authority shall be deemed to include reference to any successor thereto. </P>
