as of February 20, 2019, by and among: Merck Sharp and Dohme Corp., a New Jersey
corporation (" _Parent_ "); Cascade Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "); and Immune Design
Corp., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain capitalized terms
used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.

RECITALS

 

A. Parent has agreed to cause Purchaser to commence a cash tender offer (as it
may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the "
_Offer_ ") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(the " _Shares_ ") for $5.85 per share (such amount, or any higher amount per
share paid pursuant to the Offer, being the " _Offer Price_ "), to the seller
in cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement.

 

B. Following the consummation of the Offer, Purchaser will be merged with and
into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company continuing as the
surviving corporation in the merger and as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
(the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby, except as expressly provided
in _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, (i) each issued and outstanding Share not owned by
Parent, Purchaser or the Company as of the Effective Time shall be converted
into the right to receive the Offer Price, in cash, without interest and (ii)
the Company shall become a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent as a result of
the Merger.

 

C. The board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best
interest of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) agreed that the Merger
shall be effected under Section 251(h) and other relevant provisions of the
DGCL, (iii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Offer
and the Merger and (iv) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the
Company tender their Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer (the " _Company
Board Recommendation_ ").

 

D. The board of directors of Purchaser has approved this Agreement and
declared it advisable for Purchaser to enter into this Agreement.

E. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company hereby acknowledges and agrees
that the Merger shall be effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall,
subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be
consummated immediately following the Offer Acceptance Time.

 



1\.

    

AGREEMENT

 

The Parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 

SECTION 1\. THE OFFER

 

1.1 The Offer.

 

(a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8_, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement but in no event more than ten
(10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act) the Offer.

(b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. The obligations of Purchaser to, and
of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares
validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer are subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the prior
satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction or waiver of the
other conditions set forth in Annex I (collectively, as they may be amended in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The
Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum
Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser expressly reserves the
right, in its sole discretion, to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any
Offer Condition and (iii) make any other changes in the terms and conditions
of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; _provided,
however,_ that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (A) decrease the Offer
Price, (B) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer (other than
by adding additional consideration (and solely with respect to any such
additional consideration)), (C) decrease the maximum number of Shares sought
to be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose conditions to the Offer in addition
to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend or modify any of the Offer Conditions in a
manner that adversely affects, or would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect, any holder of Shares or that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the consummation of the Offer or
prevent, delay or impair the ability of Parent or Purchaser to consummate the
Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, (F) change or waive the Minimum
Condition, (G) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date in a manner
other than as required or permitted by this Agreement or (H) provide any
"subsequent offering period" within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated
under the Exchange Act. The Offer may not be withdrawn prior to the Expiration
Date (or any rescheduled Expiration Date) of the Offer, unless this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8_.

(c) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at one (1) minute following 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on
the 20th Business Day following the Offer Commencement Date, determined as set
forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act (unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company) (the " _Initial
Expiration Date_ ," such date or such subsequent date to which the expiration
of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the "
_Expiration Date_ "). Subject to the Parties respective termination rights
under  _Section_ __ _ 8_: (i) if, as of the

 



2\.

    

 scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not
been waived, Purchaser may, in its discretion (and without the consent of the
Company or any other Person), extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for
an additional period of up to ten (10) Business Days per extension, to permit
such Offer Condition to be satisfied; (ii) Purchaser shall extend the Offer
from time to time for: (A) any period required by any Legal Requirement, any
interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff thereof or Nasdaq applicable
to the Offer; and (B) periods of up to ten (10) Business Days per extension,
until any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the
consummation of the Offer under the HSR Act shall have expired or been
terminated; (iii) if, as of the then-scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer
Condition (other than the Minimum Condition) is not satisfied and has not
been waived, at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall extend the Offer
on one or more occasions for an additional period specified by the Company of
up to ten (10) Business Days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to
be satisfied; and (iv) if, as of the scheduled Expiration Date, the Minimum
Condition is not satisfied but all other Offer Conditions (other than the
Offer Condition set forth in clause (e) of Annex I) have been satisfied or
waived, at the written request of the Company, Purchaser shall extend the
Offer on up to three occasions for an additional period specified by the
Company of up to ten (10) Business Days per such extension to permit the
Minimum Condition to be satisfied;  _provided, however,_ that in no event
shall Purchaser: (1) be required to extend the Offer beyond the earliest to
occur of (the " _Extension Deadline_ ") (x) the valid termination of this
Agreement in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 8_ and (y) the first Business
Day immediately following the End Date; or (2) be permitted to extend the
Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the prior written consent of the
Company. Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer, or permit the Offer to
expire, prior to the Extension Deadline without the prior written consent of
the Company.

 

(d) Termination of Offer. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall
not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or
withdrawn by Purchaser, Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any
depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof.

(e) Offer Documents. As promptly as practicable on the Offer Commencement
Date, Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer
statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ ") that will contain as an exhibit the Offer to Purchase and
forms of the letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other
customary ancillary documents in each case related to the Offer and (ii) cause
the Offer to Purchase and related documents to be disseminated to holders of
Shares together with all amendments or supplements thereto (collectively, the
" _Offer Documents_ "). The Offer Documents filed by either Parent or
Purchaser with the SEC shall comply in all material respects with the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable
Legal Requirements, and shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omission of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that such information shall have

 



3\.

    

 become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent further
agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. The Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise make
available to Parent and Purchaser or Parents legal counsel all information
concerning the Company and the Companys stockholders that may be required or
reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 1.1(e)_. The Company and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the
Company and its counsel with any comments Parent, Purchaser or their counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after receipt of such comments. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the
Company shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer. Parent and Purchaser shall
provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the formulation of any response to any such comments of the SEC or its staff
and a reasonable opportunity to participate in any discussions with the SEC
or its staff concerning such comments.

(f) Payment; Funds. On the terms specified herein and subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Purchaser, waiver of the
Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to,
irrevocably accept for payment at the Offer Acceptance Time and pay for, all
of the Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the
Offer as promptly as practicable after the Offer Acceptance Time. Without
limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 9.10_, Parent shall cause to
be provided to Purchaser all of the funds necessary to purchase any Shares
that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall
cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely basis, all of Purchasers obligations
under this Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and
Purchaser shall ensure that all of their respective controlled Affiliates
shall, tender any Shares held by them into the Offer.

 

(g) Adjustments. Without limiting the obligations of the Company pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 5.2_, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer
Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or
class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision
of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted; it being understood that, for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 1.1(g)_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

 

1.2 Company Actions.

 

(a) Schedule 14D-9. The Company shall file with the SEC, concurrently with
the filing by Parent and Purchaser of the Schedule TO, and disseminate to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws, a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement
on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that, subject to _Section_ __ _
6.1(b)_, shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation and shall provide
each of the holders of Shares with the notice contemplated by Section
262(d)(2) of the DGCL. Prior to such filing and dissemination, the Company
shall set the Stockholder List Date as the record date for the purpose of
receiving the notice required by

 



4\.

    

 Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. The Company agrees that it shall cause the
Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and other applicable
Legal Requirements, and shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omission of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond
promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and Purchaser shall
promptly furnish or otherwise make available to the Company or its legal
counsel all information concerning Parent and Purchaser that may be required
in connection with any action contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 1.2(a)_.
Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment thereto prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel
with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such
comments. The obligations of the Company in this  _Section_ __ _ 1.2(a)_
shall not apply if the Company Board effects a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation or has formally determined to do so. The Company shall respond
promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9.

(b) Stockholder Lists. The Company shall, or shall cause its transfer agent
to, promptly furnish to Parent or its information agent a list of its
stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists
of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case
accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date, and shall
provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists of
stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such
other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the
Offer. The date of the list used to determine the Persons to whom the Offer
Documents and Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the " _Stockholder List
Date_." Parent and Purchaser and their agents shall hold in confidence in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement the information contained in
any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated, shall, upon request, deliver, and shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the Company (or, at
Parents option, destroy) all copies and any extracts or summaries from such
information then in their possession or control.

patent applications included in the Scheduled IP that is solely owned or co-
owned by an Acquired Corporation properly identifies by name each and every
Company Associate that is an inventor of the claims thereof as determined in
accordance with applicable Legal Requirements of the United States, and to
the Knowledge of the Company, the Legal Requirements of each country in which
such patent or patent application is filed. Other than as set forth on _Part
3.8(a)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Acquired Corporations
exclusively own and possess all right, title and interest in and to, or have
the right to use, pursuant to a valid and enforceable agreement, all Company
IP used by the Acquired Corporations or otherwise necessary for the operation
of the business of the Acquired Corporations, as currently conducted, free
and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. As of the
date of this Agreement, other than as set forth on _Part 3.8(a)(iii)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, no Registered IP listed on _Part 3.8(a)(i)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule has been the subject of any interference,
opposition, cancellation, reissue, reexamination or other substantially
similar proceeding of any nature (other than initial examination proceedings)
that has not been finally resolved, and no such proceeding is pending or
threatened in writing, in each case in which the scope, validity,
enforceability or ownership of any Registered IP listed on _Part 3.8(a)(i)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule is being or has been contested or
challenged.

 



16\.

    

(b) No current or former Company Associate owns or has any claim, right
(whether or not currently exercisable) or interest to or in any Company IP and
each current and former Company Associate who is or was involved in the
creation or development of any material Company IP (including any Registered
IP) has signed a written agreement containing an assignment of all
Intellectual Property Rights relating to such Company IP to an Acquired
Corporation and confidentiality provisions protecting such material Company
IP.

 

(c) No funding, facilities or personnel of any Governmental Body or any
university, college, research institute or other educational institution has
been or is being used to create, in whole or in part, Intellectual Property
Rights owned or purported to be owned by an Acquired Corporation, except for
any such funding or use of facilities or personnel that does not result in
such Governmental Body or institution obtaining ownership rights to such
Intellectual Property Rights.

 

(d) _Part 3.8(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each license
agreement pursuant to which an Acquired Corporation licenses in any
Intellectual Property Right (each an " _In-bound License_") or licenses out
any Intellectual Property Right owned by an Acquired Corporation (each an "
_Out-bound License_") (provided, that, In-bound Licenses shall not include
commercially available off-the-shelf software agreements, clinical trial
agreements and material transfer agreements entered into in the ordinary
course of business, and Out-bound Licenses shall not include clinical trial
agreements, material transfer agreements and non-exclusive outbound licenses
entered into in the ordinary course of business).

 

(e) Neither the operation of the business of the Acquired Corporations nor the
development, sale or exploitation by or on behalf of the Acquired
Corporations of any product in which any Company IP is embedded infringes, has
infringed, misappropriates, has misappropriated, or otherwise violates or has
violated any Intellectual Property Rights of any other Person. To the
Knowledge of the Company, no other Person is infringing, misappropriating or
otherwise violating any Company IP owned by or exclusively licensed to an
Acquired Corporation. As of the date of this Agreement, no Legal Proceeding is
pending and served (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is being threatened
or is pending and has not been served) against an Acquired Corporation or by
an Acquired Corporation relating to any actual, alleged or suspected
infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any Intellectual
Property Rights of another Person or of the Companys Registered IP or the
Companys Intellectual Property Rights. Since January 1, 2016, the Company has
not received any written notice or other written communication relating to
any actual, alleged or suspected infringement, misappropriation or other
violation of any Intellectual Property Right of another Person by an Acquired
Corporation, including any request that an Acquired Corporation consider
taking a license under any patents owned by another Person. No Acquired
Corporation has received a formal or written opinion of counsel regarding
possible infringement, misappropriation or violation by any Acquired
Corporation of any Intellectual Property Rights of any other Person or the
validity or enforceability of any Intellectual Property Rights of any other
Person. The Acquired Corporations have the exclusive, unrestricted right to
sue for past, present and future infringement of the Company IP owned or
purported to be owned by, or exclusively licensed to, an Acquired Corporation.

 

(f) None of the Acquired Corporations is now nor has ever been a member or
promoter of, or a contributor to, any industry standards body or any similar
organization that would reasonably be expected to

 



17\.

    

 require or obligate the Acquired Corporation to grant or offer to any other
Person any license or right to any Company IP.

 

(g) None of the Company IP owned or purported to be owned by, or exclusively
licensed to, an Acquired Corporation, and to the Knowledge of the Company,
none of the Company IP exclusively licensed to the Company, is subject to any
pending or outstanding injunction, directive, order, judgment or other
disposition of dispute that adversely restricts the use,
transfer, registration or licensing of any such Company IP by the Acquired
Corporations or otherwise adversely affects the validity, scope, use,
registrability, or enforceability of any Company IP. The Acquired Corporations
have not transferred ownership of, or granted any exclusive license with
respect to any Company IP, nor has any Acquired Corporation agreed to
otherwise restrict or limit its use of any Company IP. Upon the consummation
of the Closing, Parent shall succeed to all of the Companys rights in the
Company IP, and all of such rights in the Company IP shall be exercisable by
Parent to the same extent as by the Acquired Corporations prior to the Closing
on substantially the same terms, including with respect to any relevant
royalty rates. No loss, cancellation or expiration of any of the Company IP is
pending or threatened in writing, or to the Knowledge of the Company,
reasonably foreseeable, other than standard patent term expiration under
applicable Legal Requirements.

(h) The Acquired Corporations have taken commercially reasonable efforts
consistent with common industry practice to protect the Company IP and have
maintained the confidentiality of all information that constitutes or
constituted a trade secret of any Acquired Corporation. The Acquired
Corporations have not taken any action or failed to take any action that
could reasonably be expected to result in the abandonment, cancellation,
forfeiture, relinquishment, invalidation or unenforceability of any Company IP
(including the failure to pay any filing, examination, issuance,
post registration and maintenance fees, annuities and the like and the
failure to disclose any known material prior art in connection with the
prosecution of patent applications), other than intentional abandonment of
Company IP in the ordinary course of business. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, to the Knowledge of the Company, no acts or
omissions of any Acquired Corporation or any party acting on behalf of or at
the direction of any Acquired Corporation have invalidated or rendered
unenforceable any patents or patent applications that are part of the
Scheduled IP under the laws of any jurisdiction as a result of (i) disclosure
of the invention or circulation of a printed publication that describes the
claimed invention, (ii) public use of the claimed invention, (iii) sale or
offer for sale of the claimed invention prior to the application for such
patent or patent application, (iv) misrepresenting any Acquired Corporations
patent rights to a standard-setting organization, (v) failing to disclose
material prior art reasonably discoverable by the Company in connection with
the prosecution of any such patent or patent application or (vi) the engaging
in of any licensing practices that constitute patent misuse. All patents and
patent applications and trademarks and trademark applications included in the
Scheduled IP have been prosecuted in compliance with the rules and procedures
of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (or to the Knowledge of the
Company, the equivalent rules or processes of any other Governmental Body
anywhere in the world where Scheduled IP has been filed) and all patent
applications and trademark applications included in the Scheduled IP are true
and correct in all material respects, including, in the case of patent
applications, with respect to inventorship.

 



18\.

    

(i) The Acquired Corporations maintain commercially reasonable policies
regarding data security, privacy, transfer, and use of personally identifiable
information and sensitive business information (collectively, " _Sensitive
Data_ ") that support compliance by the Acquired Corporations with all
applicable Legal Requirements. The Acquired Corporations are in compliance
with all such policies in all material respects and other Legal Requirements
pertaining to data privacy and data security of any Sensitive Data. To the
Knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2017, there have been (i) no
losses or thefts of data or security breaches relating to Sensitive Data used
in the business of the Acquired Corporations, (ii) no violations of any
security policy of any Acquired Corporations regarding any such Sensitive
Data, (iii) no unauthorized access or unauthorized use of any Sensitive Data
used in the business of the Acquired Corporations and (iv) no unintended or
improper disclosure of any personally identifiable information in the
possession, custody or control of any Acquired Corporation or a contractor or
agent acting on behalf of any Acquired Corporation.

29\.

    

 (a) to conduct its business in the manner in which its business is currently
being conducted; (b) to own and use its assets in the manner in which its
assets are currently owned and used; and (c) to perform its obligations under

other charter and organizational documents of Parent and Purchaser, including
all amendments thereto.

 

4.2 Purchaser. Purchaser was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the

be required by the Exchange Act (including the filing with the SEC of the
Offer Documents), state takeover laws, the DGCL or the HSR Act, neither Parent
nor Purchaser, nor any of Parents other Affiliates, is required to make any
filing with or give any notice to, or to obtain any Consent from, any Person

this Agreement by Parent or Purchaser or the consummation by Parent or
Purchaser of the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, other than such

made or given, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. No vote of Parents stockholders is necessary to approve this

contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor Purchaser
makes any representation with respect to any statement made or incorporated
by reference therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of the
Company for inclusion or incorporation in the Offer Documents.

 

4.6 Absence of Litigation. There is no Legal Proceeding pending and served or,
to the Knowledge of Parent, pending and not served against Parent or
Purchaser, except as would not and would not reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect Parents or Purchasers ability to consummate
the Transactions.

resources in immediately available funds and in an amount sufficient to

to comply with, all of its obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement
dated December 4, 2018, between the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality

determines in good faith, (A) after consultation with financial advisors and

described in clauses (x) and (y) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_ would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements, then the Company and its

disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that is required by applicable
Legal Requirements or (iii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
that this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_ shall not be deemed to permit the Company
Board to make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation except to the extent
permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_.

 

(f) The Company agrees that in the event any Representative of an Acquired
Corporation takes any action that, if taken by the Company, would constitute
a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the Company shall be deemed to be in

or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser), or publicly propose to
withdraw or withhold (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Purchaser), the Company Board Recommendation, (B) adopt, approve, recommend or
declare advisable, or publicly propose to adopt, approve, recommend or declare

adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to adopt, approve,

any Contract (x) with respect to, or that is intended to or would reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or (y) requiring, or
reasonably expected to cause, the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail
to consummate, or that would otherwise materially impede, interfere with or be
inconsistent with, the Transactions (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement entered into in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.3_).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_, at
any time prior to accepting for payment such number of Shares validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as satisfies the
Minimum Condition (the " _Offer Acceptance Time_ "):

 

(i) if the Company has received a written _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal
(which Acquisition Proposal did not arise out of a breach of _Section_ __ _
5.3_) from any Person that has not been withdrawn and after consultation with
outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith,
that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, (x) the Company Board may
make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or (y) the Company may terminate
this Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement with respect to such
Superior Offer in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_, in each case, if
and only if: (A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to
the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the
Company shall have given Parent prior written notice of its intention to
consider making a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_ at least four (4) Business Days

Proposal and all other material information contemplated to be provided in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_, (2) the Company shall have given

Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another
proposal and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to
such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, and (3) after considering

 



38\.

    

 the results of any such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made
by Parent, if any, (x) after consultation with the Companys financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good
faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer and (y) after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to
make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_ would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Legal Requirements. Issuance of any "stop, look and listen" communication by
or on behalf of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be considered
a Company Adverse Change Recommendation and shall not require the giving of a
Determination Notice or compliance with the procedures set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.1_. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(i)_ shall also apply to any material amendment to any

references to four (4) Business Days shall be deemed to be two (2)
Business Days; and

(ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board
may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to a Change in
Circumstance, if and only if: (A) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure
to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board
to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the
Company shall have given Parent a Determination Notice at least four (4)

Business Days after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement or make another proposal, and shall have negotiated in
good faith with Parent and its Representatives (to the extent Parent desires
to do so) with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any,
and (3) after considering the results of any such negotiations and giving
effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good
faith, that the failure to make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation in
response to such Change in Circumstance would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Legal Requirements. For the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(ii)_ shall also apply to any
material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such Change in
Circumstance and require a new Determination Notice, except that for purposes
of such subsequent Determination Notice, the references to four (4) Business
Days shall be deemed to be two (2) Business Days.

occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or applicable governing documents) of each Acquired

under this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_ until disposition of such claim. 

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation (together with their
successors and assigns, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as an officer or
director of the Acquired Corporations against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such Indemnified
Person as an officer or director of the Acquired Corporations in connection

or officer of the Acquired Corporations at or prior to the Effective Time and
pertaining to any and all matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, including any such matter arising under any claim
with respect to the transactions contemplated herein. Without limiting the
foregoing, from the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on
which the Effective

 



43\.

    

 Time occurs, the Indemnifying Parties shall also, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, advance reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys fees) incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection
with matters for which such Indemnified Persons are eligible to
be indemnified pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_ within 15 days after
receipt by Parent of a written request for such advance, subject to the
execution by such Indemnified Persons of appropriate undertakings in favor of
the Indemnifying Parties to repay such advanced costs and expenses if it is
ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be
indemnified under this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_.

(c) (i) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, and Parent shall cause

Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement) for the benefit of the
Indemnified Persons who are currently covered by such existing policies with
respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time in
their capacities as directors and officers of the Acquired Corporations (as
applicable), on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no
less favorable than the existing policies, or (ii) at or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent may (and the Acquired Corporations, upon Parents
written request delivered to the Company not less than ten Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, shall) through a nationally recognized insurance
broker approved by Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) purchase a six (6)-year "tail" policy for the
director and officer insurance policies of the Acquired Corporations in effect
as of the date hereof, with such "tail policy" to be effective as of the
Effective Time, and if such "tail policy" has been obtained, it shall be
deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain and/or maintain insurance pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(c)_; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall
the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one (1) year an amount
in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently payable by the Acquired
Corporations with respect to such current policies, it being understood that
if the annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such
amount, Parent shall be obligated to cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such amount;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the Acquired Corporations
insurance broker as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a
nationally recognized insurance broker.

 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at
Parents option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_.

(e) The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ shall survive the acceptance
of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger
and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs and
(ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by 

 



44\.

    

 contract or otherwise. Unless required by applicable Legal Requirement, this
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_ may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Offer
Acceptance Time in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any
Indemnified Person or any of their successors, assigns or heirs without the
prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Person.

 

6.6 Securityholder Litigation. Until the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8_, the Company shall promptly notify Parent
of any Legal Proceedings against the Acquired Corporations and/or any of their
directors or officers relating to the Transactions. Parent shall have the
right to participate in the defense or settlement of any such Legal
Proceeding and to review and comment on all material filings or responses to
be made by the Company in connection with such Legal Proceedings, and the
Company will in good faith take such comments into account, and no
settlement, release, waiver or compromise relating to the Transactions shall
be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

6.7 Additional Agreements. Without limitation or contravention of the
provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, and subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the
Offer and the Merger and make effective the other Transactions. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, each Party to this Agreement shall (a) make all filings (if
any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such

required to be obtained pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement or
Material Contract by such Party in connection with the Transactions and (c)
use commercially reasonable efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other

8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Effective Time:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company at any time prior to

accordance with this Agreement) shall have expired without the acceptance for
payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer; _provided,_

 



47\.

    

  _however,_ that a Party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_ if the failure of the acceptance for
payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer is primarily caused by a failure on
the part of such Party to perform in any material respect any covenant or
obligation in this Agreement required to be performed by such Party at or
prior to the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer;

(c) by either Parent or the Company if a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Body shall have issued a decree or ruling, or shall have
taken any other action, having the effect of permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the acceptance for payment of Shares
pursuant to the Offer or the Merger or making consummation of the Offer or
the Merger illegal, which order, decree, ruling or other action shall be final
and nonappealable; _provided, however,_ that a Party shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ if the
issuance of such final and nonappealable order, decree, ruling or other action
is primarily caused by a failure on the part of such Party to perform in any
material respect any covenant or obligation in this Agreement required to be
performed by such Party at or prior to the Effective Time;

(d) by Parent at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if, whether or
not permitted to do so: (i) the Company Board shall have failed to include the

effected a Company Adverse Change Recommendation; (ii) the Company Board shall
have failed to publicly reaffirm its recommendation of this Agreement within

Parent may only make such request once every 30 days if no Acquisition
Proposal has been publicly disclosed; or (iii) in the case of a tender
offer or exchange offer by a party other than Parent and Purchaser that is
subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act, the Company Board fails to
reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation and recommend, in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, rejection of such
tender offer or exchange offer within ten (10) Business Days of the
commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer;

 

(e) by either Parent or the Company if the Offer Acceptance Time shall not
have occurred on or prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on June 20, 2019 (such
date, the " _End Date_ "); _provided, however,_ that a Party shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_
if the failure of the Offer Acceptance Time to occur prior to the End Date is
primarily caused by the failure on the part of such Party to perform in any
material respect any covenant or obligation in this Agreement required to be
performed by such Party; 

(f) by the Company, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, in order
to accept a Superior Offer and substantially simultaneously with such
termination enter into a binding written definitive acquisition agreement
providing for the consummation of a transaction constituting a Superior Offer
(a " _Specified Agreement_ ");  _provided_ that the Company has complied in
all respects with the requirements of _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and _Section_ __ _
6.1(b)(i)_ with respect to such Superior Offer and substantially concurrently
with such termination, the Company has paid the Termination Fee to Parent in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.3_;

 



48\.

    

(g) by Parent at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if a breach of
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or failure to
perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement on the part of the
Company shall have occurred such that the condition set forth in clause
"(b)", "(c)" or "(e)" of Annex I would not be satisfied and cannot be cured
by the Company by the End Date, or if capable of being cured by the End Date,
shall not have been cured within 30 days of the date Parent gives the Company
written notice of such breach or failure to perform; _provided, however,_
that, Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_ if either Parent or Purchaser is then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation
hereunder; or

(h) by the Company at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if a
breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or
failure to perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement on the part of
Parent or Purchaser shall have occurred, in each case if such breach or
failure has prevented or would reasonably be expected to prevent Parent or
Purchaser from consummating the Offer or the Merger when required pursuant to
this Agreement and such breach or failure cannot be cured by Parent
or Purchaser, as applicable, by the End Date, or if capable of being cured by
the End Date, shall not have been cured within 30 days of the date the Company
gives Parent written notice of such breach or failure to perform; _provided,
however,_  that, the Company shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_ if the Company is then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation
hereunder.

 

8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, written notice thereof shall be given
to the other Party or Parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to
which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall be of no further
force or effect and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent,
Purchaser or the Company or any of their respective directors, officers and
Affiliates following any such termination; _provided, however,_ that (a)

survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and
effect, (b) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with
its terms and (c) the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any
Party from any liability for common law fraud or Willful Breach of this
Agreement prior to the date of termination. Nothing herein shall limit or
prevent any Party from exercising any rights or remedies it may have under
_Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_ in lieu of terminating this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_.

8.3 Expenses; Termination Fee.

 

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid

8.1(f)_;

 



49\.

    

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
8.1(d)_; or

(iii) (x) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_,
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_ (but only if at such time
Parent would not be prohibited from terminating this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_), (y) any Person shall have publicly disclosed a _bona
fide_ Acquisition Proposal (or, in the case of _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_, any
Acquisition Proposal shall been communicated to the Company Board) after the
date hereof and prior to such termination and (z) within twelve (12) months of
such termination the Company shall have consummated an Acquisition Proposal or
entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
that is subsequently consummated (provided that for purposes of this clause
(z) the references to "20%" in the definition of " _Acquisition Proposal_ "

then, in any such event under clause "(i)", "(ii)" or "(iii)" of this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds (x) in the case of

after such termination or (z) in the case of _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)(iii)_,
within two (2) Business Days after the consummation of the Acquisition
Proposal referred to in subclause (iii)(z) above; it being understood that in
no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than
one occasion. As used herein, " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount
equal to $10,500,000.

(c) Without limiting any remedies of Parent or Purchaser in the case of
common law fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to the date of
termination of this Agreement, each of Parent and Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that (i) Parents right to
receive payment from the Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.3(b)_ and any payments pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(d)_ shall be

respective Affiliates against the Acquired Corporations and any of their
respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners,
stockholders, optionholders, managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, "
_Company Related Parties_ ") for any loss suffered in connection with the
termination of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the receipt of the Termination Fee

this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iii) none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions;  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _
8.3(c)_ shall limit the rights of Parent or Purchaser under _Section_ __ _
9.5(b)_.

 

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section_ __
_ 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, and, in order to obtain the payment,
Parent commences a Legal Proceeding which results in a judgment against the
Company, the Company shall pay Parent its reasonable and documented costs and
expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection
with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on

 



50\.

    

 such amount at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date such

amended with the approval of the respective boards of directors of the
Company and Parent at any time. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

 

9.2 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any
claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege
or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable
or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

9.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Schedule or in any certificate or schedule or other document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger.

 

9.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts. This Agreement and the other agreements
and schedules referred to herein constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among or between any of the Parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof; _provided, however,_ that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
not be superseded and shall remain in full force and effect; _provided,
further, that,_ if the Effective Time occurs, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall automatically terminate and be of no further force and effect. This
Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same
instrument. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by PDF shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance;
Remedies.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Subject to
_Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement: (i) each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents
and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of
the State of Delaware and

 



51\.

    

 any state appellate court therefrom or, if such court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New Castle County in
the State of Delaware (it being agreed that the consents to jurisdiction and
venue set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)_ shall not constitute general
consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no
effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be
deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties hereto); and (ii)
each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of process by first class
certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at
which such Party is to receive notice in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.8_.
The Parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Legal
Requirements; _provided, however,_ that nothing in the foregoing shall
restrict any Partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or
any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the Parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the provisions
of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in _Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)_ without
proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled under this Agreement, (ii) the provisions set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 8.3_: (x) are not intended to and do not adequately
compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement; and
(y) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any
Partys right to specific enforcement and (iii) the right of specific
performance is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties hereto have an adequate
remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or equity. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9_ _.5(b)_ shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided, however,_ that
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned without
the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto, and any attempted
assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such consent shall
be void and of no effect; _provided, further, however,_ that Parent or
Purchaser may assign this Agreement to any of their Affiliates ( _provided_
that such assignment shall not impede or delay the consummation of the

 



52\.

    

 Transactions); provided that no such assignment or pledge permitted pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ shall relieve Parent of its obligations
hereunder.

 

9.7 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the
Parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or

of the Company Related Parties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(c)_.

prescribed in the first paragraph of this Section. A telegram, cablegram or
other electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and
transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person or persons
authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be
written, signed and dated for the purposes of this Section to the
extent permitted by law. Any such consent shall be delivered in accordance
with Section 228(d)(1) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 

Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may

 _Section_ __ _ 3_. _Record Date_.

 

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to

shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such
meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be
the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such
meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such
record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be
the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the
Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if

change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record
date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record
date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to
such action. If no record

   

 date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such
purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of
Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action without a meeting, (including by telegram,
cablegram or other electronic transmission as permitted by law), the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors,
and which record date shall be not more than ten days after the date upon
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted. If no record date has
been fixed by the Board of Directors and no prior action by the Board of
Directors is required by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the record
date shall be the first date on which a consent setting forth the action taken
or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in the manner

address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. Without limiting the
manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any
notice to stockholders may be given by electronic transmission in the manner
provided in Section 232 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 2_. _Waivers_.

 

A written waiver of any notice, signed by a stockholder or director, or waiver
by electronic transmission by such person, whether given before or after the
time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent
to the notice required to be given to such person. Neither the business nor
the purpose of any meeting need be specified in such a waiver.

   

_ARTICLE VII_ - _MISCELLANEOUS_  

_Section_ __ _ 1_. _Facsimile Signatures_.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in

its final disposition, provided, however, that, to the extent required by law,
such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the

thereupon (but not before) be entitled to file suit to recover the unpaid
amount of such claim. If successful in whole or in part, the Covered
Person shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim to
the fullest extent permitted by law. In any such action, the Corporation shall
have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not entitled to the
requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law.

_Section_ __ _ 4_.  _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_.

The rights conferred on any Covered Person by this ARTICLE VIII shall not be

acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation,
these Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise.

_Section_ __ _ 5_. _Amendment or Repeal_.

suit or proceeding for which indemnification or advancement of expenses is
sought.

any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
