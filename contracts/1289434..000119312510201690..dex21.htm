vi AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of August 29,
2010, among 3M COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), VENTURA
ACQUISITION CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and COGENT, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ ").

 

 _R ECITALS_

 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, Parent has agreed to cause
Merger Sub to commence a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time
as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all the shares
of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding (each, a " _Share_ " and,
collectively, the " _Shares_ ") at a price per Share of $10.50 (such amount,
or any other amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement,
the " _Offer Price_ "), net to the seller in cash, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, following consummation of the Offer, the parties intend that Merger
Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the
Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), and each share of Company Common Stock that is not tendered and
accepted pursuant to the Offer will thereupon be canceled and converted into
the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
certain stockholders of the Company have entered into a Voting and Tender
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, with Parent (the " _Voting and Tender
Agreement_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
(i) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer
and the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the
Companys stockholders and (ii) approved this Agreement and the Transactions
(as defined in Section 1.2(a)), including the Offer and the Merger, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties
hereto agree as follows: ARTICLE 1

 

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) (i) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with Section 8.1, as promptly as practicable but in no event later
than ten business days (as defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated by the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")), after
the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, commence the Offer within the meaning of the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent
to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of
Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject to the
conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The initial
expiration date of the Offer shall be the 20th business day following the
commencement of the Offer (determined using Exchange Act Rule 14d-1(g)(3)).
Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to waive any condition to the Offer or
modify the terms of the Offer, except that, without the consent of the
Company, Merger Sub shall not (A) reduce the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the Offer, (B) reduce the Offer Price, (C) waive the
Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in  _Exhibit A_ ) unless (and only to
the extent) the Minimum Tender Condition is not satisfied solely by reason of
the failure of any holder of Shares to comply with his or its obligations
under Section 3 of the Voting and Tender Agreement, (D) add to the Offer
Conditions or modify any Offer Condition in a manner adverse to the holders of
Company Common Stock, (E) extend the Offer (except as required or permitted by
the other provisions of this Section 1.1), (F) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer or (G) otherwise amend the Offer in any
manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock.

 

(ii) Parent and Merger Sub agree that Merger Sub shall be permitted to
(without the consent of the Company), and shall (and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to):

(A) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the
Offer; and

(B) if, on the initial expiration date or any subsequent date as of which the
Offer is scheduled to expire, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not
been waived, then Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause it to, extend the
Offer on one or more occasions in consecutive increments of up to ten
business days each (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree),
until such time as such Offer Conditions are satisfied;

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) Merger Sub shall not be required to extend
the Offer beyond the Outside Date (as defined in Section 8.1(b)(i)) or the
termination of this Agreement and (2) if, at any expiration of the Offer, all
of the Offer Conditions, except for the Minimum Tender Condition, are
satisfied or have been waived, Merger Sub shall only be required to extend
the Offer for one or more additional periods not to exceed an aggregate of
twenty business days.



 

2 (iii) If fewer than 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, then Merger Sub may,
and at the request of the Company, shall, and upon any such request of the
Company, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, make available a "subsequent
offering period," in accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated by the SEC under
the Exchange Act, of not less than ten business days.

(iv) On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, pay for all
shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer
as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer.

(v) Nothing contained in this Section 1.1(a) shall affect any termination
rights in Article 8, as to the Agreement, or in _Exhibit A_ , as to the Offer.

 

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents
included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any
supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Unless
previously withdrawn in accordance with Section 6.8(d), Parent and Merger Sub
shall be entitled to include the Company Recommendations (as defined in
Section 3.3(b)) in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Merger
Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents
and to cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed
with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The
Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon the Offer Documents and any amendments thereto prior to filing
such documents with the SEC or dissemination of such documents to the
stockholders of the Company. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company
and its counsel in writing any comments Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after the receipt of such comments, shall consult with the Company
and its counsel prior to responding to such comments, and shall provide to the
Company and its counsel a copy of any written responses thereto and
telephonic notice of any oral responses or discussions with the SEC staff.

(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

 

Section 1.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting and
Tender Agreement (collectively, the " _Transactions_ ").



 

3 (b) Within ten business days after the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, as amended from time to
time, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") including the Company Recommendation (subject
to Section 6.8(d)) and shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders of
Company Common Stock. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps
necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule
14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated
to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company shall provide
Parent and Merger Sub and its counsel in writing with any comments
the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments, shall
consult with Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel prior to responding to
such comments, and shall provide to Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel a
copy of any written responses thereto and telephonic notice of any oral
responses or discussions with the SEC staff.

 

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall instruct its transfer
agent to furnish Merger Sub promptly with mailing labels containing the names
and addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock as of a recent
date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date,
together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position
listings and computer files and all other information in the Companys
possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock,
and shall furnish to Merger Sub such information and assistance (including
updated lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files)
as Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the holders of
Company Common Stock. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and
except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and
Merger Sub shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such
labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in connection
with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated,
shall, upon request, deliver to the Company all copies of such information
then in their possession.

 

Section 1.3 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.6),
in accordance with this Agreement and the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease,
and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation. For purposes of
this Agreement, (i) the corporation surviving the Merger after the Effective
Time may be referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ " and (ii) the
Company and Merger Sub are collectively referred to as the " _Constituent
Corporations_."

 

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

 

Section 1.5 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall

parties, which shall be no later than the second business day after
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law (as defined in
Section 3.3(c)) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 7 (other than
any such



 

4  conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date,
which shall be required to be so satisfied or (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) waived on the Closing Date), at the offices of Cleary
Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP, One Liberty Plaza, New York, NY, unless another
time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (such date
upon which the Closing occurs, the " _Closing Date_ ").

Section 1.6 _Consummation of the Merger_. As soon as practicable after the
Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of
merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State, or at such
later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger (the time and date the Merger becomes effective being
the " _Effective Time_ " and " _Effective Date_ ," respectively).

Section 1.7 _Organizational Documents; Directors and Officers_. The
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended at
the Effective Time to conform to _Exhibit B_ , and as so amended, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter

in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein and under
the DGCL. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall serve
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.
The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall serve until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors

irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase from the Company the
number of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ")
equal to the lesser of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that,
when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Merger
Sub as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes
one share more than 90% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then
outstanding on a fully diluted basis, determined in accordance with _Schedule
1.8_ and assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares and (ii) the
aggregate of the number of shares of Company Common Stock held as treasury
shares by the Company and any Company Subsidiary (as defined in Section 3.1)
and the number of shares of Company Common Stock that the Company is
authorized to issue under its certificate of incorporation but that are not
issued and outstanding (and are not reserved for issuance pursuant to the

settlement of Restricted Stock Units (as defined in Section 2.4(a)) as of
immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option. The obligation of the
Company to issue and deliver the Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of
the Top-Up Option is subject only to the condition that no legal restraint
(other than any listing requirement

 



 

5  of any securities exchange) that has the effect of preventing the exercise
of the Top-Up Option or the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares
in respect of such exercise shall be in effect.

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Sub, in whole or in part, at
any time at or after the acceptance for payment of, and payment by Merger Sub
for, any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the "
_Acceptance Time_ "). The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up
Option Shares shall be determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up
Option Shares by the Merger Consideration. Such purchase price may be paid by
Merger Sub, at its election, either in cash or by executing and delivering to
the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to
such purchase price, or by any combination of cash and such promissory note.
Any such promissory note shall be full recourse against Parent and Merger Sub,
be due one year from the date the Top-Up Option Shares are issued, bear
interest at the rate of 5% per annum and may be prepaid without premium or
penalty.

(c) In the event that Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, it
shall deliver to the Company a notice setting forth (i) the number of Top-Up
Option Shares that it intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii)
the manner in which it intends to pay the applicable purchase price and (iii)
the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares by Merger Sub is to take place. At the closing of the purchase of the
Top-Up Option Shares, Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company
the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for such Top-Up Option
Shares and the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate
representing such shares.

 

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities
Act_ "), and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for
transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Merger Sub represent
and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, or will be upon the purchase
of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "Accredited Investor," as defined in Rule 501
of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up
Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-
Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act.

ARTICLE 2

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT

 

CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of Merger Sub capital stock, each
share of Merger Sub capital stock shall be

 



 

6  converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.2 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of Company Common Stock:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares to
be canceled pursuant to Section 2.2(b) and Appraisal Shares) shall be canceled
and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive the Offer
Price without interest thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate
in accordance with Section 2.3, without interest.

(b) _Treasury Shares and Shares Owned by Parent_. Each share of Company
Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each share of Company
Common Stock owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall
be made with respect thereto.

(c) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the right to
receive Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.2(a), but rather the
holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to be paid the fair value of
such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of
such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares shall
cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right
to receive, Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.2(a). The Company
shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company
for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. The parties
hereby agree and acknowledge that in any appraisal proceeding with respect to
the Appraisal Shares and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
the fair value of the Appraisal Shares shall be determined in accordance with
Section 262 without regard to the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Option Shares or
any promissory note delivered by Merger Sub to the Company in payment for the
Top-Up Option Shares.



 

7 Section 2.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement with such bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), which shall
provide for the payment of Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms
of this Section 2.3. Parent shall, or shall take all steps necessary to
enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for
payment by the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Article 2, the
cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into
the right to receive Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time but in any event not later than three business days
thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
") and to each holder of uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Uncertificated Shares_ "), in each case whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.2, (i)
a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or the Uncertificated Shares
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or the transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder
of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by
a Certificate or Uncertificated Share, upon (A) surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, or (B) receipt of an "agents message" by the
Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange
Agent may reasonably request), in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares. Upon payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to
the provisions of this Article 2, each Certificate or Uncertificated Share so
surrendered or transferred shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person (as defined
in Section 3.4(a)) other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered or the Uncertificated Shares so transferred is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer or such Uncertificated Shares shall be properly transferred and the
Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
(as defined in Section 3.12(i)) required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares
or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Each Certificate and each Uncertificated Share shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon surrender in accordance with this Section 2.3 the Merger
Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock shall have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.2. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue
on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2.

 



 

8 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
transfer of Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article
2 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by
such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, _subject_ , _however_ , to the
Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have
been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this
Agreement and that remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company
of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article 2, except as otherwise provided by Law.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, and any holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Uncertificated Share
shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any
amounts payable pursuant to this Article 2 would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority (as defined in Section
3.3(d)), any such amounts shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement (including the Offer) to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options or Restricted Stock Units such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and paid to the appropriate taxing authorities, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options or
Restricted Stock Units in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.



 

9 Section 2.4 _Company Options; Restricted Stock Units_.

 

(a) Parent shall not assume or otherwise replace any Company Options in
connection with the Transactions. As soon as practicable following the date
of this Agreement, the Company Board or, if appropriate, any committee thereof

actions as may be required to provide that, at the Effective Time, and without
any action on the part of any holder of any outstanding Option (as
hereinafter defined), whether vested or unvested, exercisable or
unexercisable, each Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior thereto shall vest and become fully exercisable in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the applicable Stock Plan (as defined below) under
which such Option was granted and the applicable stock option agreement for
such Option. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth below in this
Section 2.4, each such Option shall terminate and be canceled at the Effective
Time and each holder of an Option will be entitled to receive from Parent,
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, and shall receive as soon
as practicable following the Effective Time, in settlement of each Option a
Cash Amount. The " _Cash Amount_ " shall be equal to the net amount of (A) the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per share of such Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of
shares subject to such Option, less (B) any applicable withholdings for Taxes.
If the exercise price per share of any Option equals or exceeds the
Merger Consideration, the Cash Amount therefor shall be zero. As used in this
Agreement, " _Options_ " means any option granted, and, immediately before the
Effective Time not exercised, expired or terminated, to a current or former
employee, director or independent contractor of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any former subsidiary of the Company or predecessor thereof to

in this Agreement, " _Stock Plans_ " means the Amended and Restated 2004
Equity Incentive Plan, the 2000 Stock Option Plan, any other stock option,
stock bonus, stock award, or stock purchase plan, program, or arrangement of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any predecessor thereof or any other
Contract (as defined in Section 3.18(a)) or agreement entered into by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 

(b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Stock
Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be
required to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
Restricted Stock Unit that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall vest in full and be settled for shares of Common
Stock with the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, as
provided in Section 2.2. As used in this Agreement, " _Restricted Stock Units_
" means any restricted stock unit award entitling the recipient to receive,
upon vesting, shares of Company Common Stock under a Stock Plan.

 

Section 2.5 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take all such
actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the Merger
under the DGCL as promptly as commercially practicable. If at any time after
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of either of the Constituent Corporations, the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully



 

10  authorized in the name of each Constituent Corporation or otherwise to take,
and shall take, all such lawful and necessary action.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 6.1 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meetings_.

 

(a) If the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Company Common Stock
is required by Law, the Company shall, at Parents request, as soon as
practicable following the Acceptance Time, prepare and file with the SEC the
Proxy Statement in preliminary form, and each of the Company and Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments of the SEC and its staff with respect thereto. The Company shall
notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements
to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply Parent
with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand,
with respect to the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to receipt of the
Required Company Stockholder Vote there shall occur any event that should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company
shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or
supplement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders of Company Common Stock as
promptly as practicable after filing with the SEC.

 

(b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Company Common Stock
is required by Law, the Company shall, at Parents request, as soon as
practicable



 

37  following the Acceptance Time, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the
purpose of seeking the Required Company Stockholder Vote. The Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from stockholders of the
Company proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and shall take all
other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the
holders of Company Common Stock required by applicable Law to effect the
Merger. Once the Company Stockholders Meeting has been called and noticed, the
Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting
without the consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed (i) for the absence of a quorum or (ii) to allow reasonable additional
time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure which it believes in good faith is necessary under applicable Law
and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and
reviewed by the holders of Company Common Stock prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ that in the event that the Company
Stockholders Meeting is delayed to a date after the Outside Date as a result
of either (i) or (ii) above, then the Outside Date shall be extended to the
fifth business day after such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent,
Merger Sub and any other Parent Subsidiary shall collectively acquire at least
90% of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock, the parties shall
take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to
become effective as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer
without a stockholders meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

 

(c) Parent shall cause all shares of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant
to the Offer and all other shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary to be voted in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement.

Section 6.2  _Employee Benefit Matters_.

(a) Parent agrees to honor in accordance with their terms all Company Employee
Benefit Plans and all employment and severance agreements in each case listed
in _Section 6.2_ of the Company Disclosure Letter or filed as exhibits to the
Available Company SEC Documents; it being understood and agreed that nothing
herein shall prevent Parent from amending or terminating any Company Employee
Benefit Plan or other agreement following the Effective Time in accordance
with its terms and applicable Law. Nothing contained in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any person any right to
employment or continued employment for any period of time by reason of this
Agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of employment.

 

(b) For the twelve-month period following the Closing Date, Parent agrees to
provide or cause the Company to provide employees of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary with employee benefits no less favorable than those
benefits currently provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to
such employees; _provided_ that Parent shall be under no obligation to retain
any employee or group of employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
other than as required by applicable Law or an employment agreement listed in
Section 6.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter or filed as exhibit to the
Available Company SEC Documents.



 

38 (c) For purposes of all employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained by or contributed to by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries in
which Company Employees participate (including, after the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation), Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
cause each such plan, program or arrangement to treat the prior service with
the Company and its affiliates of each person who is an employee or former
employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Closing (a " _Company Employee_ ") (to the same extent such service is
recognized under analogous plans, programs or arrangements of the Company or
its affiliates prior to the Closing) as service rendered to Parent or the
Parent Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for purposes of eligibility
to participate in and vesting thereunder (but not benefit accrual);
_provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service shall not operate to
duplicate any benefit or the funding of such benefit. Company Employees shall
also be given credit for any deductible or co-payment amounts paid in respect
of the plan year in which the Closing occurs, to the extent that, following
the Closing, they participate in any other plan for which deductibles or co-
payments are required. Parent shall also cause each Employee Benefit Plan
maintained by or contributed to by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) in which Company
Employees participate, to waive any preexisting condition that was waived
under the terms of any Company Employee Benefit Plan immediately prior to the
Closing or waiting period limitation which would otherwise be applicable to a
Company Employee on or after the Closing. Parent shall recognize any accrued
but unused vacation, sick leave, and sabbatical time of the Company Employees
as of the Closing Date, in accordance with the terms of such Company policies
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide such vacation,
sick leave, and sabbatical time in accordance with the terms of such Company
policies but in no event will Parent be obligated to extend or enlarge the
benefits available under such Company policies.

 

(d) Parent agrees to provide any required notice under the federal Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended (the " _WARN
Act_ "), and any similar federal, state or local Law or regulation, and to
otherwise comply with the WARN Act and any such other similar Law or
regulation with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined
in the WARN Act) or group termination or similar event affecting Company
Employees (including as a result of the consummation of the Transactions) and
occurring from and after the Closing. Parent shall not take any action on or
after the Closing Date that would cause any termination of employment of any
employees by Company or its affiliates that occurs prior to the Closing to
constitute a "plant closing," "mass layoff" or group termination or similar
event under the WARN Act or any similar federal, state, local or foreign Law
or regulation, or to create any liability or penalty to Company or its
affiliates for any employment terminations under applicable Law.

 

Section 6.3 _Antitrust Filings_. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
each, as promptly as practicable, and in any event no later than 15 days
after the date of this Agreement, file or cause to be filed with the Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the United States Department of Justice (the
" _DOJ_ ") and foreign Governmental Authorities the filings and other
materials required under the HSR Act or other applicable antitrust or
competition Laws in order to consummate this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger,
and the Transactions. Parent shall pay directly to the applicable
Governmental Authority the applicable filing fee required in connection with
the filings and other materials required under the HSR Act or other applicable
antitrust or competition Laws in connection with the Transaction.

 



 

39 Section 6.4 _Public Statements_. Neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries, shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other announcement with respect to the Offer, the Merger or
this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party, unless such party
determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by
applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a
national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to the
Offer, the Merger or this Agreement, in which event such party shall endeavor,
on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful
opportunity to the other parties to review and comment upon such press
release or other announcement and shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided,
however_ , that the party seeking to issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other announcement with respect to the Offer, the Merger or
this Agreement shall not be required to provide any such review or comment to
the other party in connection with any disclosure contemplated by Section 6.8.

Parent and Merger Sub agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or

connection with the Transactions. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree
that they shall consult and cooperate with each other with respect to
the obtaining of all such necessary permits, consents, approvals and

hereto. Each of Parent and Merger Sub and the Company shall (i) promptly
notify the other parties of any written communication to that party from any

them and their affiliates and their respective representatives on one hand,
and any such Governmental Authority or its staff on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions.

 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Parent or Merger Sub or any other
Subsidiary of Parent to, and the Company shall not and cause each Company
Subsidiary to not, agree (i) to limit in any manner whatsoever or not to
exercise any rights of ownership of any securities (including the Shares), or
to divest, dispose of or hold separate any securities or all or a portion of
their respective businesses, assets or properties or of the business, assets

this Section 6.6 shall not be considered in determining whether the Offer
Conditions have been satisfied. In no event shall the delivery of any notice
by a party pursuant to this Section 6.6 limit or otherwise affect the
respective rights, obligations, remedies, representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations
of the parties under this Agreement.

41 (b) The provisions of the Non-Disclosure Agreement dated as of July 31, 2008,
between Parent and the Company and amended on May 31, 2010 (as amended, the "

Representatives in connection with the Transactions, which, at the time of
disclosure, is designated as confidential (or like designation) shall be
used, disclosed, or copied only for the purposes of, and only in accordance
with, this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions. The Company
shall use, at a minimum, the same degree of care as it uses to protect its

regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public information with respect

any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to,

faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law and solely to the extent necessary to permit such third party
to submit a Takeover Proposal to the Company Board, release any third party
from any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Company is a
party, fail to reasonably enforce or grant any material waiver, request or
consent to any Takeover Proposal under, any such agreement. The Company
shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary and the Companys and each such
Company Subsidiarys respective Representatives to, immediately cease and
terminate any existing discussions or negotiations heretofore conducted
by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or their respective Representatives
with respect to any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly after the
date of this Agreement instruct each Person which has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement relating to any Takeover Proposal with or for the
benefit of the Company to promptly return or destroy all information,
documents and materials relating to an Takeover Proposal or to the Company or
its businesses, operations or affairs heretofore furnished by the Company or
any of its Representatives to such Person or any of its Representatives in
accordance with the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such Person.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in Section 6.8(a), if, prior to
the acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer, in response to an unsolicited written Takeover Proposal from a third
party that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) 



 

42  is, or would reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, a Superior
Proposal (as defined in Section 6.8(f)(ii)) and that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board
to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, the Company and its
Representatives may, subject to its giving Parent at least twenty-four hours
prior written notice (which notice shall contain the identity of the person
making such Takeover Proposal and a description of the material terms and
conditions pertinent thereto), (i) furnish information with respect to the
Company and each Company Subsidiary to the person making such
Takeover Proposal and its representatives pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement which, to the extent such confidentiality agreement is entered after
the date hereof, contains terms no less favorable to the Company than the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (except that such confidentiality
agreement, to the extent entered after the date hereof, shall contain
additional provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply with the
provisions of this Section 6.8), _provided_ , that a copy of all such
information is delivered simultaneously to Parent to the extent it has not
previously been so furnished to Parent and (ii) engage in such negotiations or
discussions with the third party that made such Takeover Proposal as the
Company Board shall determine (including solicitation of a revised Takeover
Proposal from such third party).

(c) Except as otherwise permitted by Section 6.8(d), neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify, modify, change or
amend (or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify, modify, change or amend) in
any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub (including pursuant to the
Schedule 14D-9, Proxy Statement or any amendment thereto), the Company
Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Takeover Proposal (any of the foregoing in clause (i) or (ii),
a _"Company Change in Recommendation"_ ) or (iii) enter into any agreement,
agreement-in-principle or letter of intent with respect to, or accept, any
Takeover Proposal.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.8, at any time prior to
the acceptance for payment of the shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer, the Company Board (or the applicable committee thereof) may (i) in
the absence of a Takeover Proposal , make a Company Change in Recommendation
if a material event or change in circumstances has occurred after the date
hereof and the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company
Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, and/or (ii) if the
Company Board (or the applicable committee thereof) has received a Takeover
Proposal (that has not been withdrawn) that constitutes a Superior Proposal,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(i) to authorize and allow
the Company to enter into a binding written agreement concerning a transaction
that constitutes a Superior Proposal, _provided_ , that: (A) prior to the
Company Board taking any action contemplated by clause (ii), the Company
shall have provided to Parent prompt written notice advising Parent of the
decision of the Company Board to take such action and the reasons therefor,
including the material terms and conditions of the Takeover Proposal; (B) the
Company shall have given Parent five business days after delivery of such
notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement (or make another
proposal) and if Parent proposes to revise the terms of this Agreement or
make another proposal, the Company shall have, during such period, negotiated
in good faith with Parent with respect to such proposed revisions or other
proposal (it being agreed that any material changes to any Takeover Proposal
shall require a new notice and a new five business day period for
negotiations); and (C) the Company Board shall

 



 

43  have determined in good faith, after considering the results of such
negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any, that
such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.8 shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the holders of Company Common
Stock a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party
pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or (ii) making any disclosure to the holders
of Company Common Stock if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board
(after consultation with outside counsel), failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law (including the
Company Boards duties of good faith and candor to the holders of Company
Common Stock) subject to compliance with any applicable requirements of this
Section 6.8. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.8(e) shall not limit
any of Parents rights under Article 8 in respect of any such position taken
or disclosure made.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) (other
than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates) relating to any
acquisition, merger, consolidation, reorganization, share exchange,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, direct or indirect business
combination, asset acquisition, exclusive license, tender or exchange offer or
other similar transaction involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary of
(A) the assets or businesses that constitute or represent 15% or more of the
total revenue, operating income, research and development budget, or assets of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 15% or more
of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or any other Company
capital stock or capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, any
Company Subsidiary directly or indirectly holding, individually or taken
together, the assets or business referred to in clause (A) above, in each
case other than the Transactions.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written offer in respect of
a Takeover Proposal received by the Company after the date hereof and not in
breach of Section 6.8(a) of this Agreement ( _provided_ , that for the
purposes of this definition all references to 15% in the definition of
Takeover Proposal shall be "majority") on terms that the Company Board
determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial
advisor and outside legal counsel), taking into account all relevant factors,
including the price, form of consideration, closing conditions, the ability
to finance the proposal and other aspects of the proposal that the Company
Board deems relevant, (A) is more favorable to the holders of Company Common
Stock than the Transactions (including the terms of any binding proposal by
Parent to modify the terms of the Transactions) and (B) is reasonably capable
of being completed on the terms proposed.

 

(g) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 6.8, the Company shall promptly, and in any case within twenty-four
hours of its receipt advise Parent of any request for information with respect
to any Takeover Proposal, or any

 



 

44  inquiry with respect to or which could reasonably be expected to result in a
Takeover Proposal, and the material terms and conditions of such request,
Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including the identify of the person who made
such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry). The Company shall keep Parent
informed on a reasonably current basis of the status and material terms and
conditions (including all material amendments or proposed
material amendments) of any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry.

Section 6.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification by the
Company now existing in favor of each person who is now, or has been at any
time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an
officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or an employee of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or who acts as a fiduciary under any of
the Company Employee Benefit Plans (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as
provided in the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws, in each case
as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other
agreements in effect on the date hereof, including provisions relating to the
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any action or suit, shall
survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect. From and after
the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be jointly and
severally liable to pay and perform in a timely manner such indemnification
obligations.

 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the Companys
officers and directors liability insurance policies, in effect on the date
of this Agreement (the " _D andO Insurance_"), for a period of not less than six
years after the Effective Time, but only to the extent related to actions or
omissions prior to the Effective Time; provided that (i) the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms no less advantageous to such former directors or
officers and (ii) such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of
coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend more than an amount per year equal to
300% of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (the "
_Maximum Amount_ ") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the amount of the annual
premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the
Maximum Amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall procure and
maintain for such six-year period as much coverage as reasonably practicable
for the Maximum Amount. Parent shall have the right to cause coverage to be
extended under the DandO Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy on
terms and conditions no less advantageous than the DandO Insurance, and such
"tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this Section 6.9(b).

(c) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under
this Section 6.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.9 applies without the consent of such
affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties to whom this Section 6.9 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of
this Section 6.9, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section
6.9). 



 

45 (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.9.

 

Section 6.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to
cause the transactions contemplated by Section 2.4 and any other dispositions
of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) or
acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including derivative securities) in
connection with this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.11 _Directors_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law and Nasdaq rules applicable to the Company,
promptly upon the Acceptance Time and as long as Parent directly or
indirectly beneficially owns not less than a majority of the issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Merger Sub shall be entitled to
designate such number of directors on the Company Board as will give Merger
Sub representation on the Company Board equal to at least that number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, that is the product of (i) the
total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the directors
elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (ii) the percentage that (A)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub or any other
subsidiary of Parent bears to (B) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock that are issued and outstanding, and the Company shall, at such time,
promptly take all necessary action to cause Merger Subs designees to be so
elected _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that Merger Subs designees
are appointed or elected to the Company Board, until the Effective Time the
Company Board shall have at least two directors who are directors on the date
of this Agreement and who are not officers of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (the " _Independent Directors_ "); and _provided, further,_ that,
in such event, if the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below
two for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent Directors shall be
entitled to designate one person to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to
be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement or, if no
Independent Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate two
persons to fill such vacancies who are not officers, stockholders or
affiliates of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent or Merger Sub, and
such persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this
Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall promptly, at
the option of Merger Sub, take all necessary action to either increase the
size of the Company Board or obtain the resignation of such number of its
current directors as is necessary to enable Merger Subs designees to be
elected or appointed to the Company Board as provided above. At such time,
the persons designated by Merger Sub shall, as nearly as practicable,
constitute at least the same percentage as persons designated by Merger Sub of
the Company Board of (1) each committee of the Company Board, (2) each board
of directors of each Company Subsidiary, and (3) each committee of each such
board, in each case only to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

46 (b) The Companys obligations to appoint designees to the Company Board shall
be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated
thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l in order to fulfill its obligations under
this Section 6.11 and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information
with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is required
under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l to fulfill its obligations under this
Section 6.11. Parent shall supply to the Company in writing and be solely
responsible for any information with respect to itself, Merger Sub and their
respective nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section
14(f) and Rule 14f-1. 

(c) Following the election or appointment of Merger Subs designees pursuant
to Section 6.11, the approval by affirmative vote or written consent of all
of the Independent Directors then in office (or, if there shall be only one
Independent Director then in office, the Independent Director) shall be
required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the
authorization of the Company Board and no other action on the part of the
Company, including any action by any committee thereof or any other director
of the Company, shall, unless otherwise required by Law, be required or
permitted to authorize) (i) any amendment or termination of this Agreement by
the Company, (ii) any extension of time for performance of any obligation or
action hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub or (iii) any waiver or exercise of
any of the Companys rights under this Agreement.

Section 6.12 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall control, and give
Parent the reasonable opportunity to participate in, the defense or settlement
of any litigation brought by stockholders of the Company against the Company
and/or its directors relating to the Transactions and the Company shall not
compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise,
settle or come to an arrangement regarding any litigation arising or resulting
from the Transactions or consent to the same without the prior written consent
of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

Section 6.13 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms set forth in this
Agreement.

 

Section 6.14 _Takeover Laws_. The Company shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, use its reasonable best efforts (a) to take all actions
necessary so that no Takeover Law becomes applicable to the Transactions and
(b) if any such Takeover Law becomes applicable to the Transactions to take
all actions necessary so that the Transactions contemplated may be
consummated as promptly as practicable.

Section 6.15 _Approval of Compensation Arrangements_. Prior to the Acceptance
Time, the Company shall take any action necessary to ensure that any Company
Arrangements (including any Company Arrangements entered into after the date
hereof) have been approved as contemplated by the last sentence of Section
3.10(h).

Section 6.16 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. After the Acceptance Time, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law and

 



 

47  rules and policies of Nasdaq to enable the de-listing by the Surviving
Corporation of the Company Common Stock from the Nasdaq and the deregistration
of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time, and in any event no more than ten calendar days
thereafter.

fulfill in any material respect any of its obligations under this Agreement
has been the cause of, or resulted in, the event specified in such clause;

 

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if any Judgment issued by a court of

perform; or

 

(e) by the Company, if

Section 8.3(a); or

 

(ii) Parent shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements

is incapable of being cured or has not been cured 



 

49  by Parent within 15 calendar days after written notice has been given by the
Company to Parent of such breach or failure to perform.

 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement shall give written notice of
such termination to the other parties.

 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. Upon the termination of this Agreement

(vi) Article 9, which shall survive such termination; _provided_ that nothing
herein shall relieve any party from any and all liabilities and damages

agree that, notwithstanding Section 9.7 and without derogation from Section
9.10, the Companys measure of damages for such a deliberate material breach
of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub may include the loss of the
economic benefits of the Offer and the Merger to the Companys stockholders).

(other than pursuant to clause (iii) thereof), then the Company shall
promptly, but in no event later than one business day after termination of
this Agreement, pay Parent the Termination Fee; _provided_ that if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) the Company shall only
be required to pay Parent the Termination Fee if such termination occurs
within ten business days of the end of the ten business day period referred
to in such section.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b) as a result of
a failure of the Minimum Tender Condition to be satisfied at the scheduled
expiration of the Offer, and (i) at any time on or after the date hereof and
prior to such termination a Takeover Proposal shall have been made to the
Company Board or the Company or publicly announced and, in each case, not
irrevocably withdrawn prior to such termination, and (ii) within nine months
after the date of such termination, the Company enters into a letter of intent
or Contract with respect to, or consummates, any transaction specified in the
definition of "Takeover Proposal", the Company shall pay Parent the
Termination Fee on the first business day after the date of the first to occur
of the events referred to in clause (ii). For purposes of this Section
8.3(b), "Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in Section
6.8(f) except that references in Section 6.8(f) to "15%" shall be replaced
by "50%."

(d) In no event shall more than one Termination Fee be payable hereunder. In
addition, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event that any Termination Fee is paid to Parent in accordance with this
Agreement, the payment of such Termination Fee shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub with 



 

50  respect to any and all claims against the Company and/or any of its
officers, directors, employees or Representatives, of whatever nature and
whenever arising, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Offer or
the Merger.

(e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that without such provisions Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into
this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay the Termination Fee and Parent or
Merger Sub commences a suit which results in a Judgment against the Company
for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay Parent
and Merger Sub their costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with interest on
the amount set forth in Section 8.3(a) hereof or portion thereof at the prime
rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date of payment.

 

(f) Except as set forth in Section 6.3 and this Section 8.3, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger
is consummated.

 

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to Section 6.11, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto, at any time before or after approval of this
Agreement and the Transactions by the respective Boards of Directors or
stockholders of the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment
shall be made which by the DGCL requires further approval by such stockholders
without obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto. 

Section 8.5 _Waiver_. Subject to Section 6.11, any failure of any of the
parties to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
herein may be waived at any time prior to the Effective Time by any of the
parties entitled to the benefit thereof only by a written instrument signed by
each such party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist
upon strict compliance with such obligation, representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Offer or the Merger
is not affected in any manner adverse in any material respect to any party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Offer and the Merger are fulfilled to the extent possible then such

(the " _Antitrust Condition_ ");

 

(iii) any of the following conditions shall exist at the time of expiration of
the Offer or immediately prior to such payment: 

(A) any Judgment issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a
Governmental Authority, or any Law shall be in effect that would (1) make the
Offer or the Merger illegal, (2) otherwise prevent the consummation thereof or
(3) impose any material limitations on the ownership or operation by Parent
(or any of its Subsidiaries) of all or any material portion of businesses or
assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to

A-1 (D) (1) any representation and warranty of the Company set forth in Section
3.2, Section 3.3(a) or Section 3.3(b) of the Merger Agreement shall not be
true and correct in all but de minimis respects as of the date of this
Agreement and as of such time, except to the extent such representation
and warranty expressly relates to an earlier time (in which case on and as of
such earlier time) or (2) any other representation and warranty of the Company
set forth in the Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct as of the date
of this Agreement and as of such time, except to the extent such
representation and warranty expressly relates to an earlier time (in which
case on and as of such earlier time), other than in the case of clause (2) for
such failures to be true and correct that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect (it being understood that for this purpose all references to
the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" and other qualifications based on
the word "material," except for the reference to the term "Company Material
Adverse Effect" in Section 3.6, shall be disregarded);

 

(E) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any
obligation or to comply in any material respect with any agreement or
covenant of the Company to be performed or complied with by it under this
Agreement prior to such time;

 

(F) the Company fails to deliver to Parent a certificate signed by a senior
executive officer of the Company dated the date on the which the Offer
expires certifying that the conditions specified in clauses (D) and (E) of
this paragraph (iii) do not exist; or

 

(G) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms;

 

which, in the sole and reasonable judgment of Merger Sub or Parent, in any
such case, makes it inadvisable to proceed with such acceptance for payment
or payment.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and
may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and
from time to time and in the sole discretion of Parent or Merger Sub, subject
in each case to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Any reference in this
Exhibit A or in the Merger Agreement to a condition or requirement being
satisfied shall be deemed met if such condition or requirement is so waived.
The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate and/or modify the
Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. The
failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any other affiliate of Parent at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right, the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and
circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time. 

Capitalized terms used in this Exhibit A but not defined herein shall have the
meanings set forth in the Agreement to which it is attached, except that the
term " _Merger Agreement_ " shall be deemed to refer to the Agreement to which
this Exhibit A is attached.
