This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of August 29, 2011 (this "Agreement"),
is by and among Cameron International Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Buyer"), LeTourneau Technologies, Inc., a Texas corporation ("Seller"), and

RECITALS

  

  

A. Parent, through a wholly-owned Subsidiary, acquired all of the capital
stock of Seller from Rowan on June 22, 2011 pursuant to the Rowan-Joy Purchase
Agreement and, through such transaction, Seller became an indirect, wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent. Prior to such transaction, Seller was directly

used in the Recitals to this Agreement have the meanings ascribed thereto,
respectively, in Section 11.1.

  

  

B. Seller owns all of the outstanding common stock, no par value (the "Rodeo
Stock"), of LeTourneau Technologies Drilling Systems, Inc., a Texas
corporation ("Rodeo");

  

  

C. Seller, through Rodeo and other indirect, wholly-owned Subsidiaries, is
engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing, distributing and selling

D. Parent and Seller desire to sell to Buyer the Rodeo Stock and the Business,

AGREEMENT

  

  

In consideration of the mutual covenants and promises contained herein and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are
hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE 1.

  

  

PURCHASE AND SALE OF STOCK

  

  

Section 1.1 Purchase and Sale. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, on the Closing Date, Seller shall sell, convey, transfer,
assign and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall acquire from Seller, all right,
title and interest of Seller in and to the shares of Rodeo Stock free and
clear of all Encumbrances.

  

  

Section 1.2 Consideration. At the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, Buyer shall pay to Seller for the sale, transfer,
assignment, conveyance and delivery of the Rodeo Stock the aggregate amount of
$375,000,000 (the "Purchase Consideration") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Seller (such designation to be
made at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date). Payment of the
Purchase Consideration shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in Section
1.3 and Section 1.4

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

Section 1.3 Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment

  

  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within 60 days thereafter, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Parent a
calculation of Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date, together with
reasonably detailed supporting information (the "Net Working Capital
Statement").

  

  

(b) From and after the delivery of the Net Working Capital Statement, Buyer
shall provide Parent and its Representatives reasonable access to the records
and employees of Buyer with respect to the Houston Business, and Buyer shall,
and shall cause such employees of Buyer and its Affiliates to, (i) cooperate
in all reasonable respects with Parent in connection with Parent's review of
the Net Working Capital Statement and (ii) provide Parent with access to
accounting records, supporting schedules and relevant information relating to
Buyer's preparation of the Net Working Capital Statement and calculation of
Net Working Capital as Parent shall reasonably request and that are available
to Buyer or its Affiliates. Within 30 days after Parent's receipt of the Net
Working Capital Statement, Parent shall notify Buyer as to whether Parent
agrees or disagrees with the Net Working Capital Statement and, if Parent
disagrees, such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the particulars of
such disagreement. If Parent provides a notice of agreement or does not
provide a notice of disagreement within such 30-day period, then Parent shall
be deemed to have accepted the calculations and the amounts set forth in the
Net Working Capital Statement delivered by Buyer, which shall then be final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. If any notice of
disagreement is timely provided in accordance with this Section 1.3(b), then
Buyer and Parent shall each use commercially reasonable efforts for a period
of 30 days thereafter (the "Net Working Capital Resolution Period") to resolve
any disagreements with respect to the calculations in the Net Working Capital
Statement.

  

  

(c) If, at the end of the Net Working Capital Resolution Period, Buyer and
Parent are unable to resolve any disagreements as to items in the Net Working
Capital Statement, then KPMG LLP (or if KPMG LLP is not willing and able to
serve in such capacity, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu or another independent
accounting firm as mutually selected by Buyer and Parent) shall resolve any
remaining disagreements. If neither KPMG LLP nor either such mutually selected
accounting firm is willing and able to serve in such capacity, then Parent
shall deliver to Buyer a list of three other accounting firms of recognized
national or regional standing, and Buyer shall select one of such three
accounting firms (such firm as is ultimately selected pursuant to the
aforementioned procedures being the "Accountant"). The Accountant shall be
charged with determining as promptly as practicable, but in any event within
30 days after the date on which such dispute is referred to the Accountant,
whether Net Working Capital as set forth in the Net Working Capital Statement
was prepared in accordance with this Agreement and (only with respect to the
disagreements as to the items set forth in the notice of disagreement and
submitted to the Accountant) whether and to what extent, if any, Net Working
Capital requires adjustment.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(d) The Accountant shall allocate its costs and expenses between Buyer and
Parent based upon the percentage of the contested amount submitted to the
Accountant that is ultimately awarded to each such party such that each such
party bears a percentage of such costs and expenses equal to the percentage of
the contested amount awarded to the other party. For example, if Parent claims
Net Working Capital is $1,000 greater than the amount determined by Buyer, and
Buyer contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Parent, and if the
Accountant ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Parent $300 of the $500
contested, then the Accountant's costs and expenses shall be allocated 60%
(i.e. 300/500) to Buyer and 40% (i.e. 200/500) to Parent. The determination of
the Accountant shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes
hereunder.

  

  

(e) The date on which Net Working Capital is finally determined in accordance
with this Section 1.3 is hereinafter referred to as the "Determination Date,"
such amount as so finally determined is hereinafter referred to as the "Final
Net Working Capital," and the calculations thereof and the supporting
information relating thereto is hereinafter referred to as the "Final Net
Working Capital Statement".

  

  

(f) Promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event within five
Business Days of the Determination Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of the Final Net Working Capital over the Target
Net Working Capital, or Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of the Target Net Working Capital over the Final Net Working
Capital, in each case together with interest at a rate equal to five percent
(5%) per annum on such amount from the Closing Date to the date of payment,
such payment to be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

  

  

Section 1.4 Customer Cash Advances.

  

  

(a) The Purchase Consideration shall be reduced by the total amount of
Customer Advances outstanding at the Closing Date that have not been applied
to Inventories as of the Closing Date (the "Customer Advances Amount").

  

  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within 90 days thereafter, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Parent a
calculation of the Customer Advances Amount, together with reasonably detailed
supporting information (the "Customer Advances Amount Statement"). For purpose
of calculating the Customer Advances Amount, the amount of Customer Advances
applied to Inventories as of the Closing Date shall be calculated taking into
consideration (i) actual cash payments to suppliers with respect to a contract
for which a Customer Advance has been received in full payment for such
Inventories and (ii) direct labor charges and internal overhead allocations
allocable to such Inventories in accordance with inventory costing accounting
principles pursuant to GAAP with respect to a contract for which a Customer
Advance has been received, excluding any amounts related to depreciation and
amortization; and (iii) the determination of Customer Advances shall be
calculated on a contract by contract basis. For avoidance of doubt the
methodology shall consist of (a) comparing the part numbers of the bill of
material for customer contracts for which Advance Payments have been received
against Inventory on hand which has been paid for as of the Closing, (b)
allocating those part numbers on hand that have been paid for at Closing
against Customer Advances on a contract by contract basis, and (c) allocating
raw materials which meet the specification of the respective bill of
materials, paid for at Closing, on a pro-rata basis among contracts for which
Customer Advances have been received and contracts for which no Customer
Advances have been received. Any excess Customer Advances, after all
allocations, on a contract by contract basis, shall be included in the
Customer Advance Amount for the purposes of this Section 1.4.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(c) From and after the delivery of the Customer Advances Amount Statement,
Buyer shall provide Parent and its Representatives reasonable access to the
records and employees of Buyer with respect to the Non-Houston Business, and
Buyer shall, and shall cause such employees of Buyer and its Affiliates to,
(i) cooperate in all reasonable respects with Parent in connection with
Parent's review of the Customer Advances Amount Statement and (ii) provide
Parent with access to accounting records, supporting schedules and relevant
information relating to Buyer's calculation of the Customer Advances Amount as
Parent shall reasonably request and that are available to Buyer or its
Affiliates. Within 30 days after Parent's receipt of the Customer Advances
Amount Statement, Parent shall notify Buyer as to whether Parent agrees or
disagrees with the Customer Advances Amount Statement and, if Parent
disagrees, such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the particulars of
such disagreement. If Parent provides a notice of agreement or does not
provide a notice of disagreement within such 30-day period, then Parent shall
be deemed to have accepted the Customer Advances Amount Statement as delivered
by Buyer, which shall then be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes
hereunder. If any notice of disagreement is timely provided in accordance with
this Section 1.4(c), then Buyer and Parent shall each use commercially
reasonable efforts for a period of 30 days thereafter to resolve any
disagreements with respect to the calculations of the Customer Advances
Amount.

  

  

(d) If, at the end of the thirty (30) day period referred to in Section
1.4(c), Buyer and Parent are unable to resolve any disagreements as to the
calculation of the Customer Advances Amount, then KPMG LLP (or if KPMG LLP is
not willing and able to serve in such capacity, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu or
another independent accounting firm as mutually selected by Buyer and Parent)
shall resolve any remaining disagreements. If neither KPMG LLP nor either such
mutually selected accounting firm is willing and able to serve in such
capacity, then Parent shall deliver to Buyer a list of three other accounting
firms of recognized national or regional standing, and Buyer shall select one
of such three accounting firms (such firm as is ultimately selected pursuant
to this Section 1.4(d) being for the purposes of this Section 1.4 only the
"Accountant"). The Accountant shall be charged with determining as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within 30 days after the date on which such
dispute is referred to the Accountant, whether the Customer Advances Amount as
calculated by Buyer was prepared in accordance with this Agreement and (only
with respect to the disagreements as to the items set forth in the notice of
disagreement and submitted to the Accountant) whether and to what extent, if
any, the Customer Advances Amount requires adjustment.

  

  

(e) The Accountant shall allocate its costs and expenses between Buyer and
Parent based upon the percentage of the contested amount submitted to the
Accountant that is ultimately awarded to each such party such that each such
party bears a percentage of such costs and expenses equal to the percentage of
the contested amount awarded to the other party. For example, if Parent claims
the Customer Advances Amount is $1,000 greater than the amount determined by
Buyer, and Buyer contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Parent, and if
the Accountant ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Parent $300 of the
$500 contested, then the Accountant's costs and expenses shall be allocated
60% (i.e. 300/500) to Buyer and 40% (i.e. 200/500) to Parent. The
determination of the Accountant shall be final, binding and conclusive for all
purposes hereunder.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(f) Promptly following the date upon which the Customer Advances Amount is
finally determined in accordance with this Section 1.4, and in any event
within five Business Days of such date, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount
equal to Customer Advances Amount, together with interest at a rate equal to
five percent (5%) per annum on such amount from the Closing Date to the date
of payment, such payment to be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds. Any payments made pursuant to this Section 1.4 will be deemed to be an
adjustment to the Purchase Consideration.

  

  

Section 1.5 Aged Payables. As of immediately prior to Closing, Parent shall
pay or cause to be paid all accounts payables arising from the Non-Houston
Business that are 45 days past invoice date as of the Closing Date. To the
extent any such account payable is not satisfied in accordance with the prior
sentence, Parent shall immediately reimburse Buyer for such amounts satisfied
by Buyer or its Affiliates after the Closing.

Section 5.3 Required Consents and Approvals; Separation of Contracts.

  

  

(a) Each party hereto hereby agrees to cooperate with each other party and use
its reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports, registrations or other
filings and submissions with third parties and Governmental Entities, (ii)
engage in consultations with appropriate third parties and Governmental
Entities, (iii) investigate, initiate, defend, contest and resist any
litigation, administrative or judicial action, or other proceeding, (iv) make
reasonable offers of compromise, and (v) obtain as promptly as practicable,
and no later than the Outside Date, all necessary Consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate the Transactions, including taking all actions
necessary to ensure that (A) no requirement for non-action, a waiver, consent
or approval of any Governmental Entity, (B) no decree, judgment, injunction,
temporary restraining order or any other order in any proceeding and (C) no
other matter relating to any Antitrust Law would preclude consummation of the
Transactions as promptly as practicable and no later than the Outside Date;
provided however, that nothing in this Agreement shall require any party to
sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct their businesses and
assets in a specified manner, or agree to sell, hold separate or otherwise
dispose of or conduct their businesses and assets in a specified manner, or
permit the sale, holding separate or other disposition of, any assets or the
conduct of their businesses and assets in a specified manner, whether as a
condition to obtaining any approval from a Governmental Entity or any other
Person or for any other reason, if such sale, holding separate or other
disposition or the conduct of their businesses and assets in a specified
manner is not conditioned on the Closing or, in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer and its
Affiliates and subsidiaries taken as a whole, after giving effect to the
Transactions. In carrying out the foregoing obligations, each of Buyer, Parent
and Seller shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each of Buyer,
Parent and Seller agree that it will keep the other party apprised of the
status of matters relating to completion of the Transactions, including
promptly furnishing the other with copies of notice or other communications
received by Buyer, Parent, Seller or their respective Affiliates from all
third parties and Governmental Entities with respect to the Transactions.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(b) Each of Buyer and Parent agree to prepare and file the Notification and
Report Form and/or other documentation required to be filed under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"),
as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event more than twenty (20) days,
after the date of this Agreement. Each such party hereby covenants to request
early termination of the waiting period required by the HSR Act (unless
otherwise agreed by their legal counsel) and to cooperate with the other
parties to the extent reasonably necessary to assist in making reasonable
supplemental presentations to the applicable Governmental Entities and, if
requested by such entities, to promptly amend or furnish additional
information thereunder. Each of Buyer and Parent shall provide copies to the
other party of the final drafts of all correspondence and filings prior to
submission of such correspondence and filings to the applicable Governmental
Entities in connection with the Transactions, and shall take into account
reasonable comments made by the other party with respect thereto, and shall
provide copies to the other party of the final correspondence and filings
immediately after the submission or filing of such documents. Subject to any
appropriate confidentiality protections, with the exception of business
documents deemed confidential by the possessing party (including documents
submitted as attachments to the party\'s filings referred to in the first
sentence of this Section 5.3(b)), Parent and Buyer shall each furnish to the
other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other party
may request in connection with the foregoing. Each of Parent and Buyer will
promptly notify the other of any oral or written communication made to or
received by either Parent or Buyer, as the case may be, from any Governmental
Entity regarding any of the Transactions. Buyer and Parent shall consult with
each other prior to taking any substantive position with respect to the
filings under any Antitrust Law in discussions with or filings to be submitted
to any Governmental Entity.

  

  

(c) If reasonably necessary to satisfy local Legal Requirements, each party
hereto shall enter into separate agreements and other conveyance documents as
needed to effectuate the Transactions, provided that the terms of such other
agreements and documents do not alter in any material respect the rights and
obligations of the Parties under this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as set
forth in Section 5.3(a) with respect to Antitrust Approvals and except as
required by Section 5.8 and Section 5.9, (i) neither Parent or its Affiliates
on the one hand or Buyer and its Affiliates on the other hand shall be
required to take any action in connection with satisfying its obligations to
obtain Consents (including without limitation any Consents listed on Schedule
3.2(c)) if such actions would require such Person to make any material
payments or suffer any material burden in order to obtain any Consent; and
(ii) without the prior written consent of Buyer, none of Parent or any Rodeo
Entity will, in seeking to obtain any such Consents, agree to amend, modify,
terminate or waive any rights under the applicable Contracts to which such
Consents relate or otherwise require any Rodeo Entity to make any payments or
suffer any burden in connection therewith.

Section 5.4 Notification. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing,
each party shall promptly notify the other parties hereto in writing if such
party becomes aware of any fact or condition that causes or constitutes a
breach of any of its representations and warranties as of the date of this
Agreement, or if such party becomes aware of the occurrence after the date of
this Agreement of any fact or condition that would (except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute a breach of any such
representation or warranty of such party had such representation or warranty
been made as of the time of occurrence or discovery of such fact or condition;
provided, however, that such disclosure shall not be deemed to cure any breach
of a representation or warranty. During the same period, each party to this
Agreement will promptly notify the other parties hereto of the occurrence of
any breach of any covenant or agreement by such party in this Agreement or of
the occurrence of any event that may make the satisfaction of the conditions
in Article 6 impossible or unlikely; provided, however, that such disclosure
shall not be deemed to cure any breach of a covenant or agreement or to
satisfy a condition. Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the
other parties of the threat or commencement of any Legal Proceeding before the
Closing that could in any way affect the ability of such party to consummate
the Transactions. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, Parent
shall notify Buyer promptly after Parent has Knowledge of the occurrence of
any breach in any material respect by Rowan of the Rowan-Joy Purchase
Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.5 No Negotiation. From the date of this Agreement through the
earlier of the Closing Date or the date on which this Agreement is earlier
terminated pursuant to Article 10, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
Affiliates or Representatives shall, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate
or encourage any inquiries or proposals from, discuss or negotiate with,
provide any information to or consider any inquiries or proposals from, any
Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives) relating to
any transaction involving the sale of all or any portion of the Business,
whether affected by sale of assets, sale of stock, merger or otherwise. Parent
shall (i) ensure that its Subsidiaries, Affiliates and Representatives are
aware of the provisions of this Section 5.5, (ii) be responsible for any
breaches by any such parties of this Section 5.5, and (iii) notify Buyer
promptly upon the receipt by it of any inquiries or proposals from any third
party relating to any such potential transaction, such notice to include the
name of such third party and the material terms and conditions of any such
inquiries or proposals. At or prior to Closing, Parent shall request and
require the return or destruction of all confidential information concerning
the Business or any Rodeo Entity made available to any third party (other than
Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives) since June 22, 2011 with respect
to or in connection with any inquiries, proposals or access to information
prior to the Closing Date and of a type described in the first sentence of
this Section 5.5 to the full extent provided in the confidentiality agreement
entered into between Parent, Seller and/or any Rodeo Entity and such third
party in connection therewith. In addition, Parent shall not release any such
third party from any such confidentiality agreement (or any obligation
thereunder) or waive, amend or alter any of such third party's obligations
thereunder and, at the reasonable request and expense of Buyer enforce the
terms of such confidentiality agreement against such third party and assign to
Buyer (to the extent assignable without the consent of such third party)
Parent's rights thereunder as it relates to the Business and the Rodeo
Entities.

to be repaid, cancelled or eliminated prior to the Closing.

  

  

Section 5.7 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Subject to Section 5.3(d),
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, each of the Parties
hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions
in Section 6.1 and 6.2 to be satisfied.

  

  

Section 5.8 Replacement of Bonds, Letters of Credit and Guarantees. The
Parties understand that none of the bonds, letters of credit and guarantees,
if any, listed on Schedule 3.5(c) and posted by Parent or any of its
Affiliates or (prior to the closing of the transactions under the Rowan-Joy
Purchase Agreement) by Rowan or any of its Affiliates with any Governmental
Entity or third party and relating to the Business are to be transferred to
Buyer. On or before Closing, Buyer shall obtain, or cause to be obtained in
the name of Buyer, replacements for such bonds, letters of credit and
guarantees to the extent such replacements are necessary to permit the
cancellation of the bonds, letters of credit and guarantees posted by Parent
and such Affiliates or Rowan and such Affiliates, as applicable, or to
consummate the Transactions.

  

  

Section 5.9 Title Insurance, Zoning Reports and Surveys. Parent acknowledges
that Buyer intends to obtain Title Insurance, Zoning Reports and Surveys in
connection with the Closing. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to assist Buyer in obtaining an ALTA Owner's Title Insurance Policy
(the "Title Policies") for each Owned Real Property, issued by First American
Title Insurance Company (the "Title Company"). Promptly following receipt by
Parent of reasonable evidence of the existence of Encumbrances of a fixed or
ascertainable amount (that individually exceeds $500,000) appearing on the
commitments issued for such Title Policies, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts (whether prior to or following Closing) to cure such Encumbrances
over $500,000. Parent shall provide the Title Company with a customary owners'
affidavit and gap indemnity in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Title
Company in order to issue the Title Policies. Seller shall provide the Title
Company with any affidavits (including owner's and non-imputation endorsement
affidavits), indemnities or other assurances reasonably requested by the Title
Company to issue the Title Policies. Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in obtaining a survey for each Owned Real
Property, dated no earlier than the date of this Agreement, prepared by
Commercial Due Diligence Services (the "Surveys"). Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in obtaining a zoning report
(or equivalent foreign report) (which, in each case, may include obtaining a
zoning compliance letter from the respective municipality) for each Owned Real
Property, dated no earlier than the date of this Agreement, prepared by Bock and
Clark Corporation (the "Zoning Reports"). Buyer shall pay all fees, costs and
expenses with respect to the Title Policies, Zoning Reports and Surveys.
Nothing in this Section 5.9 shall require such cooperation from Parent to the
extent it would interfere unreasonably with the Business or operations of
Parent or its Affiliates or delay the Closing. Nothing in this Section 5.9
shall require such cooperation from Parent or its Affiliates to the extent
that it relates to the cure of a Permitted Encumbrance.

consideration, to promptly do such things and execute, acknowledge, and
deliver any further documents and instruments of transfer (including bills of
sale and assignment and assumption agreements, as applicable), in each case in

necessary or desirable to effectuate the Transfer to and Acceptance by (i)
Rodeo or its designated Affiliate of the Transferred Drilling Assets and the
Assumed Drilling Liabilities and (ii) Parent or its designated Affiliate of
the Retained Assets and Retained Liabilities.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to
the contrary, neither this Agreement nor any Ancillary Agreement shall
constitute an agreement to Transfer, license or sublicense any Transferred
Drilling Asset, Assumed Drilling Liability, Retained Asset or Retained
Liability that cannot be transferred, licensed or sublicensed without the
consent of any Person, other than Parent, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates, to the extent that such consent shall not have been given prior to
the Closing; provided, however, that each of Parent and Buyer shall use, both
prior to and after the Closing, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, all
necessary consents to the Transfer, license or sublicense, as applicable, of
any of such Transferred Drilling Assets, Assumed Drilling Liabilities,
Retained Assets and Retained Liabilities, it being understood that to the
extent the foregoing shall require any action by Parent, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates that would, or would continue to, affect, in the case of

Liability, or in the case of Buyer and its Affiliates, any Retained Asset or

the Buyer or its Affiliates (with respect to any Transferred Drilling Asset or

Retained Liability)), such action shall require the prior written consent of
Buyer (with respect to any Transferred Drilling Asset or Assumed Drilling
Liability) or Parent (with respect to any Retained Asset or Retained
Liability), which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld. Upon obtaining
the requisite third party consents thereto, any such Transferred Drilling
Asset, Assumed Drilling Liability, Retained Asset or Retained Liability, as
the case may be, shall be Transferred, licensed or sublicensed to Buyer (or
its designee) or Parent, respectively, in accordance with Section 5.11(b).

Liability, Retained Asset or Retained Liability that is not Transferred,
licensed or sublicensed to Buyer or its Affiliates or Parent or its
Affiliates, respectively, at the Closing by reason of Section 5.11(c) (a
"Nonassigned Asset"), after the Closing and until any requisite consent is
obtained and the foregoing is Transferred, licensed or sublicensed to Buyer or
its Affiliates or Parent or its Affiliates, respectively, (i) the parties
shall cooperate with each other, upon written request, in endeavoring to
obtain for the intended transferee, assignee, licensee or sublicensee (the

(and shall cause its Affiliates to) provide to the Intended Transferee,
substantially comparable benefits thereof and shall enforce, at the request of
and for the account of the Intended Transferee, any rights of the Intended
Transferor arising thereunder against any Person upon the advice of the
Intended Transferee, in each case, to the extent (and only to the extent) that
such Intended Transferor may provide such benefits or enforce such rights (x)
without violating the terms of, or governing, such Transferred Drilling Asset,
Assumed Drilling Liability, Retained Asset or Retained Liability and (y)
without incurring any material expense or otherwise taking any material
actions or measures (such as hiring additional employees) not reimbursed by
the Intended Transferee, and (ii) the Intended Transferee shall perform at its
sole expense the obligations of such Intended Transferor and its Affiliates to
be performed after the Closing under each applicable Contract that is, or
governs, the applicable Transferred Drilling Asset, Assumed Drilling
Liability, Retained Asset or Retained Liability.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 5.11,

INDEMNIFICATION; REMEDIES

  

  

Section 7.1 Survival of Claims. All representations and warranties of Parent,
Seller and Buyer contained herein and all claims for breaches of pre-Closing
covenants in Article 5 shall survive until the one year anniversary of the
Closing Date; provided, however, that the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.1 (Organization and Good Standing), Section 3.2(a)
(Authority), Section 3.3 (Capitalization), Section 3.9 (Taxes), Section 4.1
(Organization of Buyer), and Section 4.2(a) (Authority) (collectively, the
"Fundamental Reps") and all claims for breach of any other covenant shall
survive the Closing indefinitely (except for the representations and
warranties contained in Section 3..9 (Taxes), which shall survive until 30
days past the applicable statute of limitations, and the representations and
warranties contained in Section 3.10 (Employees and Employee Benefits), which
shall survive until the third anniversary of the Closing Date). The right to
indemnification based on such representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements and obligations herein will not be affected by any investigation
conducted with respect to, or any Knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy
of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant, agreement
or obligation.

  

  

Section 7.2 Indemnification.

  

  

(a) By Parent and Seller. From and after the Closing, Parent and Seller shall
jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and each of
its Affiliates, Subsidiaries and Representatives (collectively, the "Parent-
Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all costs, losses,
Liabilities, obligations, damages, lawsuits, deficiencies, claims, demands or
expenses (whether or not arising out of thirty party claims), including
without limitation interest, penalties, reasonable legal fees and all
reasonable amounts paid in investigation or defense, and all amounts paid in
settlement, of any of the foregoing (collectively, "Damages"), resulting from:

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(i) any breach of any representations or warranty made by Parent or Seller in
this Agreement (provided that, except with respect to the representation and
warranty contained in Section 3.8(a), for purposes of determining whether
there has been a breach of any such representation or warranty and/or the
amount of any Damages related to such breach, such representation or warranty
shall be considered without regard to any qualifications indicated by the
words "in all material respects", "in any material respect", "material",
"materially", "material adverse effect" or "Material Adverse Effect" set forth
therein);

  

  

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made by Parent or Seller in this
Agreement;

  

  

(iii) any claim by any Person for brokerage or finder's fees or commissions or
similar payments based on any agreement or understanding alleged to have been
made by such Person with Parent, Seller or Rodeo (or any Person acting (or
purportedly acting) on behalf of any such Person) in connection with the
Transactions;

  

  

(iv) any claim by any Person against Buyer and its Affiliates (including,
following the Closing, Rodeo) relating to the Contract for the construction of
the Rowan Rig (including any claim for breach of such Contract) and any Legal
Proceeding in connection therewith;

  

  

(v) any Retained Assets or Retained Liabilities; or

  

  

(vi) any claim by any Person relating to any breach by Rodeo of the Consorcio
Agreements, including any claim for liquidated damages, arising from facts or
circumstances occurring or the performance of such agreements prior to
Closing.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 7.2(a), this Section 7.2 shall not duplicate the
indemnity obligation of Parent for a Tax Damage for which indemnification
provisions are set forth in Section 8.10.

  

  

(c) By Buyer. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each of Parent, Seller and its respective Subsidiaries,
Affiliates and Representatives (the "Buyer-Indemnified Parties") from and
against any and all Damages resulting from:

  

  

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this
Agreement (provided that, for purposes of determining whether there has been a
breach of any such representation or warranty and/or the amount of any Damages
related to such breach, such representation or warranty shall be considered
without regard to any qualifications indicated by the words "in all material
respects", "in any material respect", "material", "materially", "material
adverse effect" or "Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein);

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement;

  

  

(iii) any claim by any Person for brokerage or finder's fees or commissions or
similar payments based on any agreement or understanding alleged to have been
made by such Person with Buyer or any Affiliate thereof (or any Person acting
(or purportedly acting) on behalf of any such Person) in connection with the
Transactions;

  

  

(iv) any claims, to the extent relating to the Business, by any Person under
any bond, letter of credit or guarantee listed on Schedule 3.5(c) and posted
or made by Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than Rodeo) with any
Governmental Entity or third Person in connection with or for the benefit of
the Business; or

  

  

(v) any Transferred Drilling Assets or the Assumed Drilling Liabilities;
provided that Buyer shall have no indemnity obligations under this Section
7.2(c)(v) with respect to matters for which Parent and Seller are required to
indemnify the Parent-Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 7.2(a).

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding Section 7.2(c), this Section 7.2 shall not duplicate the
indemnity obligation of Buyer for claims or damages for which indemnification
provisions are set forth in Section 9.1(b) or Section 9.1(d)(ii).

  

  

(e) Notice of Claims. If a claim for Damages (a "Claim") is to be made by a
party entitled to indemnification hereunder against the indemnifying party,
the party claiming such indemnification shall give written notice (a "Claim
Notice") to the indemnifying party as soon as practicable after the party
entitled to indemnification becomes aware of any fact, condition or event
which may give rise to Damages for which indemnification may be sought under
thisSection 7.2 ; provided, however, that the failure to provide such written
notice shall not excuse the indemnifying party from any of its obligations
under this Section 7.2 except to the extent (and only to the extent) that such
failure shall have caused the Damages for which the indemnifying party is
obligated to be materially greater than such Damages would have been had the
indemnified party given the indemnifying party prompt notice hereunder.

  

  

(f) Defense of Third-Party Claims. If any lawsuit or enforcement action is
filed by a third party against any party entitled to the benefit of indemnity
hereunder with respect thereto, written notice thereof shall be given to the
indemnifying party as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 15
calendar days after the service of the citation or summons). The failure of
any indemnified party to give timely notice hereunder shall not affect rights
to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the indemnifying party
has been materially damaged by such failure as described in the proviso to
Section 7.2(e)). After such notice, if (1) the indemnifying party shall
acknowledge in writing to the indemnified party that the indemnifying party is
obligated under the terms of its indemnity hereunder to indemnify the
indemnified party in connection with such lawsuit or action, and (2) such
third party claim is solely for monetary damages, and is not brought by a
customer, Governmental Entity or a supplier listed on Schedule 3.20, then the
indemnifying party shall be entitled, if it elects to do so, at its own cost,
risk and expense, (i) to take control of the defense and investigation of such
lawsuit or action, (ii) to employ and engage legal counsel of its own choice,
but, in any event, reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party, to handle
and defend the same unless the named parties to such action or proceeding
(including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party and the indemnified party has been advised by counsel that
there may be one or more legal defenses available to such indemnified party
that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying
party, in which event the indemnified party shall be entitled, at the
indemnifying party's cost, risk and expense, to separate counsel of its own
choosing. The indemnifying party shall not, without the written consent of the
indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, (x) settle or compromise any Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment which does not include an unconditional written release by the
claimant or plaintiff of the indemnified party from all liability in respect
of such Claim or (y) settle or compromise any Claim if the settlement imposes
equitable remedies or obligations on the indemnified party other than
financial obligations for which such indemnified party will be fully
indemnified hereunder. No Claim which is being defended in good faith by the
indemnifying party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be
settled or compromised by the indemnified party without the written consent of
the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

If the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of such lawsuit or
action within 30 calendar days after receipt of the Claim Notice or is not
permitted to assume such defense pursuant to thisSection 7.2 (f), the
indemnified party against which such lawsuit or action has been asserted will
(upon delivering notice to such effect to the indemnifying party) have the
right to undertake, at the indemnifying party's cost and expense, the defense,
compromise or settlement of such lawsuit or action on behalf of and for the
account and risk of the indemnifying party; provided, however, that such
lawsuit or action shall not be compromised or settled without the written
consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the indemnified party settles or
compromises such lawsuit or action without the prior written consent of the
indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will bear no liability hereunder
for or with respect to such lawsuit or action unless the indemnifying party
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed its consent. In the event either
party assumes the defense of a particular lawsuit or action in the manner
contemplated above, the party assuming such defense will keep the other party
reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or
settlement. The indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any
action effected pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 7.2 and for
any final judgment (subject to any right of appeal), and the indemnifying
party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party from and
against any Damages by reason of such settlement or judgment.

  

  

(g) Exclusivity. Except as provided in Section 8.10 , Section 9.1(b), Section
9.1(d)(ii), Section 9.6(c), Section 9.7.(d) and Section 11.14, the
indemnification provided in this Article 7 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of any Seller-Indemnified Party and any Buyer-Indemnified Party in
respect of matters addressed in Section 7.2(a) and (c), respectively. Except
as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, the indemnification
provisions of this Article 7, Article 8, Section 9.1(b) and Section 9.(d)(ii)
shall govern all claims by the Parties for breaches of this Agreement, except
with respect to breaches or claims based upon fraud, as to which the Parties
shall have, in addition to the indemnification provisions of this Article 7,
Article 8, Section 9.1(b) and Section 9.(d)(ii), all of their rights and
remedies at law.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(h) Limitation on Indemnity/Commitments.

  

  

(i) The indemnification obligations of Parent and Buyer with respect to any
breach of any representation, warranty or pre-Closing covenant in Article 5
pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i), Section 7.2(a)(ii), Section 7.2(c)(i), or
Section 7.2(c)(ii), respectively, shall be limited to Claims made on or prior
to the applicable last date of survival thereof referred to in Section 7.1.
The indemnification obligations of Parent and Buyer with respect to any other
basis for indemnification obligations, including the indemnification
obligations of Parent pursuant to clauses (ii) (other than with respect to
pre-Closing covenants in Article 5) (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of Section
7.2(a), and the indemnification obligations of Buyer pursuant to clauses (ii)
(with respect to post-Closing covenants), (iii), (iv) and (v) of Section
7.2(c) shall survive indefinitely subject to the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

(ii) The Parent-Indemnified Parties may not recover Damages from Parent
pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) until the aggregate amount of Damages relating
to all Claims for which the Parent-Indemnified Parties, in the aggregate, are
seeking indemnification under Section 7.2(a)(i) exceeds $3,636,000 (the
"Deductible") and then only for the amount by which the aggregate amount of
Damages for which the Parent-Indemnified Parties are seeking indemnification
pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) exceeds the Deductible; provided, however, that
Claims for Damages pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) resulting from fraud or a
breach of the Fundamental Reps made by Parent or Seller shall not be subject
to the Deductible, and shall be recoverable from the first dollar. In
calculating the Deductible, any Damages that individually, or collectively as
part of a series of items arising from the same or substantially similar facts
or circumstances, amount to less than $100,000 shall be excluded in their
entirety, shall not be counted toward the Deductible and the indemnifying
party shall have no Liability to the Parent-Indemnified Parties therefor. The
Parent-Indemnified Parties shall have the right to make a Claim under Section
7.2(a)(i) prior to the time the Deductible has been surpassed for the purpose
of asserting such Claim within the relevant survival period and any such Claim
made within such period shall, to the extent the Deductible ultimately is met,
survive until its final resolution. This Section 7.2(h)(ii) shall not apply to
Claims for indemnifica­tion made pursuant to clause (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and
(vi) of Section 7.2(a).

  

  

(iii) The aggregate amount of Damages that may be recovered by the Parent-
Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) may not exceed $32,727,272
(the "Cap"); provided, however, that this limitation shall not apply to Claims
for Damages pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) resulting from fraud or a breach of
the Fundamental Reps made by Parent or Seller. This Section 7.2(h)(iii) shall
not apply to Claims for indemnification made pursuant to clause (ii), (iii),
(iv), (v) and (vi) of Section 7.2(a); provided, however, that the aggregate
amount of Damages that may be recovered by the Parent-Indemnified Parties
pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(vi) may not exceed an amount equal to 80% of the
Damages resulting from any claim by any Person relating to any breach by Rodeo
of the Consorcio Agreements, including any claim for liquidated damages,
arising from facts or circumstances occurring or the performance of such
agreements prior to Closing.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(iv) The Buyer-Indemnified Parties may not recover Damages from Buyer pursuant
to Section 7.2(c)(i) until the aggregate amount of Damages for which the
Buyer-Indemnified Parties, in the aggregate, are seeking indemnification
pursuant to Section 7.2(c)(i) exceeds the Deductible and then only for the
amount by which the aggregate amount of Damages for which the Buyer-
Indemnified Parties are seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2(c)(i)
exceeds the Deductible; provided, however, that Claims for Damages pursuant to
Section 7.2(c)(i) resulting from fraud or a breach of the Fundamental Reps
made by Buyer shall not be subject to the Deductible, and shall be recoverable
from the first dollar. The Buyer-Indemnified Parties shall have the right to
make a Claim under Section 7.2(c)(i) prior to the time at which the Deductible
has been surpassed for the purpose of asserting such Claim within the relevant
survival period and any such Claim made within such period shall, to the
extent the Deductible ultimately is met, survive until its final resolution.
The aggregate amount of Damages that may be recovered by the Buyer-Indemnified
Parties pursuant to Section 7.2(c)(i) may not exceed the Cap; provided,
however, that this limitation shall not apply to Claims for Damages pursuant
to Section 7.2(c)(i) resulting from fraud or breach of the Fundamental Reps
made by Buyer. This Section 7.2(h)(iv) shall not apply to Claims for
indemnification made pursuant to clause (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section
7.2(c).

  

  

(v) Neither (A) the termination of the representations or warranties contained
herein, nor (B) the expiration of the indemnification obligations described
above, will affect the rights of a Person in respect of any Claim made by such
Person prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period provided
herein.

  

  

(vi) (A) To the extent that any Damages that are subject to indemnification
under this Agreement are covered by insurance, the amount of any indemnity
payment shall be net of the Net Proceeds of any insurance policy paid to the
indemnified party with respect to such Damages, (B) any indemnification under
this Agreement shall be decreased by the amount of any Tax Benefit, (C) any
Damages that are subject to indemnification under this Agreement shall be
decreased to the extent that such Damages are reflected in the Final Net
Working Capital Statement and (D) no indemnification for Damages under this
Agreement shall arise or be required to the extent that such Damages (1)
relate to Taxes for a Post-Closing Tax Period, except to the extent such Taxes
arise from a breach of a representation or warranty set forth in Section
3.9(j), or (2) result from or arise out of any reduction or limitation on the
use of any Tax attribute (including without limitation any net operating loss
carryover or credit carryover) of Rodeo attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, except to the extent such reduction or limitation results in a Tax
liability which is subject to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.10(a)(i).
For purposes of this Section 7.2(h)(vi), "Net Proceeds" shall mean the
insurance proceeds actually received, less any expenses of recovery,
deductibles, and/or co-payments. If any amounts are reimbursed under insurance
coverage subsequent to indemnification under this Article, the indemnified
party shall reimburse the indemnifying party in an amount equal to the amounts
subsequently received under insurance coverage (net of the expenses of
recovery). For purposes of this Section 7.2(h)(vi), to the extent a Tax
Benefit is not realized in the year in which the indemnity payment is required
to be made, the indemnified party (or any Affiliate thereof) shall pay to the
indemnifying party (or any Affiliate thereof) the amount of such Tax Benefit
when it is realized.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(vii) In no event shall an indemnifying party be liable for punitive, special
or consequential damages sustained or claimed by an indemnified party except
to the extent such damages arise from a third-party Claim. Damages must be
established with reasonable certainty and are limited to those Damages that
were reasonably foreseeable or in the reasonable contemplation of the Parties
as of the date of this Agreement, except to the extent such damages arise from
a third-party Claim. Liabilities shall be determined after taking into account
any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually received by the
indemnified party from any third party with respect thereto.

  

  

ARTICLE 8.

  

  

CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

  

  

Section 8.1 Tax Returns.

  

  

(a) Parent shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) in a manner consistent with
applicable Law and past practice and file (or cause to be filed) all Tax
Returns of the Rodeo Entities that are filed on a separate return basis for
all Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date that are filed after the
Closing Date. Parent shall, without duplicating Parent's indemnity obligation
under Section 8.11, pay (or cause to be paid) to Buyer not less than five
Business Days prior to the due date of any such Tax Return all Taxes shown as
due on such Tax Returns, except to the extent such Taxes are shown as a
reserve on the Final Net Working Capital Statement. At least 20 Business Days
prior to the filing of any such Tax Returns, Parent shall permit Buyer to
review and comment on such Tax Returns and shall make such revisions to such
Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Buyer (provided, however, Parent
shall not be required to make any revision requested by Buyer if such revision
relates to an item that Parent prepared in accordance with applicable Law and
past practice). Buyer shall file such Tax Returns on or prior to the due date
thereof.

  

  

(b) Parent will prepare and file all federal, state, local or foreign Tax
Returns with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period ("Consolidated Pre-Closing
Tax Returns") that are filed on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis,
include Rodeo, and are required to be filed after the Closing Date, and shall
pay all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. The Rodeo Entities will
provide, at Parent's sole expense, all information in their possession and not
otherwise available to Parent that is required to be included in such
Consolidated Pre-Closing Tax Returns as Parent may reasonably request within
10 days of such request .

  

  

(c) Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) in a manner consistent with
past practice and file (or cause to be filed) all Tax Returns of the Rodeo
Entities that are filed on a separate return basis for all Straddle Periods.
At least 20 Business Days prior to the filing of any such Tax Returns, Buyer
shall permit Parent to review and comment on such Tax Returns and shall make
such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Parent
(provided, however, Buyer shall not be required to make any revision requested
by Parent if such revision relates to an item that Buyer prepared in
accordance with applicable Law and the past practice of the Rodeo Entities).

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

Section 8.2 Amending Tax Returns. Buyer shall not file (or cause to be filed)
or amend (or cause to be amended) or make (or cause to be made) any Tax
election that could adversely affect, any Tax Return of any Rodeo Entity for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  

  

Section 8.3 Tax Refunds. Parent shall be entitled to the amount of any refund
or credit of Taxes of the Rodeo Entities with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period which refund or credit is actually recognized by Buyer or its
Affiliates (including the Rodeo Entities) after the Closing. Buyer shall pay,
or cause to be paid, to Parent any amount to which Parent is entitled pursuant
to the prior sentence within ten Business Days of the receipt or recognition
of the applicable refund or credit by Buyer or its Affiliates.

  

  

Section 8.4 Post-Closing Actions. Other than with respect to the Section
338(h)(10) Election, Buyer agrees to indemnify Parent for any additional Tax
owed by Parent (including tax owed by Parent due to this indemnification
payment) resulting from any transaction engaged in by any Rodeo Entity not in
the Ordinary Course of Business occurring on the Closing Date after Buyer's
purchase of the Rodeo Stock. If Buyer reasonably believes that any Rodeo
Entity is required by applicable Law to file a Tax Return for a Post-Closing
Tax Period in a jurisdiction in which such Rodeo Entity has not previously
filed a Tax Return (such Tax Return, a "New Jurisdiction Tax Return"), Buyer
shall promptly notify Parent of its belief and provide Parent with a statement
setting forth in reasonable detail Buyer's basis for its belief. Buyer and
Parent shall discuss for a period of 30 days in good faith whether such New
Jurisdiction Tax Return is in fact required to be filed under applicable Law.
Such discussions may include discussions Parent is required to have with Rowan
pursuant to obligations contained Section 8.4 of the Rowan-Joy Purchase
Agreement. Following such consultation period, Buyer shall be free to file any
such New Jurisdiction Tax Return if Buyer continues to reasonably believe such
Tax Return is required to be filed. Such filing in no way shall prejudice
Buyer's right to indemnification under Section 8.10. In connection with the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement, if Buyer makes an election
under Section 338(g) and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and
any corresponding or similar elections under state or local Tax Law with
respect to any foreign Subsidiary of Rodeo, Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller
for any adverse Tax consequences suffered by Seller resulting from such
election.

  

  

Section 8.5 Cooperation. Buyer, the Rodeo Entities and Parent shall reasonably
cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any
Tax Contest. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
party's request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such Tax Contest and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

Section 8.6 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use,
registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including all applicable
real estate transfer Taxes) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions ("Transfer Taxes") shall be borne equally by Buyer and Parent.

  

  

Section 8.7 Characterization of Payments. Any indemnification payments made
pursuant to Article 7 or this Article 8 shall constitute an adjustment of the
consideration paid for the Rodeo Stock for Tax purposes and shall be treated
as such by Parties to the extent permitted by law.

  

  

Section 8.8 Overlap Provisions. In the event of any conflict or overlap
between the provisions of this Article 8 and Article 7, the provisions of this
Article 8 shall control.

  

  

Section 8.9 FIRPTA Certificate. Parent and Seller each shall deliver to Buyer
on or prior to the Closing Date, a certificate signed by an authorized
representative of Parent and Seller, respectively, in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer, to the effect that neither Parent nor Seller is a
"foreign person" as defined in Section 1445 of the Code.

  

  

Section 8.10 Tax Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Except to the extent reflected in the Final Net Working Capital Statement
and subject to Section 7.2(h)(vi), Parent hereby indemnifies Buyer and each of
its Affiliates, Subsidiaries and Representatives, against and agrees to hold
them harmless from any Damages resulting from any (i) Tax Liabilities of the
Rodeo Entities for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and (ii) Taxes of any member
(other than the Rodeo Entities) of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or
unitary group of which Parent, Seller, or any Rodeo Entity is or was a member
on or prior to the Closing Date by reason of Liability under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6, or comparable provision of foreign, state or
local Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that the indemnification obligations contemplated by this Section 8.10
are applicable with respect to all Tax periods (or portions thereof) ending on
or before the Closing Date, including all Tax periods (or portions thereof)
occurring prior to ownership of the Rodeo Entities by Parent and Seller
pursuant to the Rowan-Joy Purchase Agreement.

  

  

(b) For purposes of Section 8.10(a), in the case of any Taxes that are payable
for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax related to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall (i) in the case of any Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (e.g. ad
valorem, property and license fees) other than Taxes set forth in clause (ii)
below, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Tax period ending as of the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Tax period, and (ii) in the case of any non-
periodic Taxes, including any Tax based upon or related to income, gains or
receipts or based upon or related to employment or sales or use, value added,
and customs duty, be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the
relevant Tax period ended as of the Closing Date. Any credits relating to a
Tax period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date shall be taken
into account as though the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date.
The portion of any credits relating to a Straddle Period shall be determined
as though the relevant taxable period ended on and included the Closing Date.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(c) Payment by Parent of any amount due under Section 8.10(a) shall be made
within ten Business Days following written notice by the indemnitee that
payment of such amounts to the appropriate Tax authority is due, provided that
Parent shall not be required to make any payment earlier than five Business
Days before it is due to the appropriate Tax authority. In the case of a Tax
that is contested in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.11 below,
payment of the Tax to the appropriate Tax authority shall not be considered to
be due earlier than the date a final determination to such effect is made by
the appropriate Tax authority or court. All costs and expenses, including any
deposit or similar payment required to be made to any Tax authority and any
out-of-pocket costs incurred in order to pursue or continue the contest of any
Tax Claim or incurred in connection with a Tax Claim shall be paid by Parent
(but only to the extent such Tax Claim relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or,
for a Straddle Period, to the portion of such period that ends on the Closing
Date).

  

  

Section 8.11 Tax Indemnification Procedures.

  

  

(a) Parent shall promptly notify the Buyer in writing upon receipt of notice
of any pending Tax audits or assessments relating to the income, properties or
operations of any Rodeo Entity. If a claim shall be made against the Buyer or
any of their Affiliates by any Tax authority, which, if successful, would
result in an indemnity payment to the Buyer or one of its Affiliates pursuant
to Section 8.10(a) (a "Tax Claim"), the Buyer shall promptly notify Parent, in
writing of such Tax Claim stating the nature and basis of such Tax Claim and
the amount thereof, to the extent known by the Buyer, provided, however, that
the failure to provide such written notice shall not excuse Parent from any of
its obligations under a Tax Claim except to the extent (and only to the
extent) that Parent is materially prejudiced thereby.

  

  

(b) With respect to any Tax Claim that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
Parent shall control at its expense all proceedings taken in connection with
such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) but shall not, without the
prior written approval of Buyer (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), agree or consent to compromise or settle, either administratively or
after the commencement of litigation, any issue or claim arising in such
proceeding, or otherwise agree or consent to any Tax Liability, to the extent
that any such compromise, settlement, consent or agreement may increase the
Tax Liability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates for any Tax period that ends
after the Closing (or portion thereof in the case of a Straddle Period),
unless Parent indemnifies the Buyer for the increase in Taxes resulting from
such compromise, settlement, consent or agreement. Buyer shall have the right
to consult with Parent regarding any audit or proceeding that could result in
an increase to the Tax Liability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates for any
Post-Closing Tax Period.

  

  

(c) Buyer shall have the right to control the conduct of any Tax Claim that
relates to a Straddle Period. The Buyer shall control all proceedings taken in
connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) but shall not,
without the prior written approval of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), agree or consent to compromise or settle, either
administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any issue or claim
arising in such proceeding, or otherwise agree or consent to any Tax
Liability, to the extent that any such compromise, settlement, consent or
agreement may increase the Tax Liability of Parent, Rodeo or any of their
Affiliates for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, unless the Buyer indemnifies Parent
for the increase in Taxes resulting from such compromise, settlement, consent
or agreement. Parent shall have the right to consult with Buyer regarding any
audit or proceeding relating to a Straddle Period.

Section 8.12 Section 338(h)(10) Elections.

  

  

(a) Buyer and Seller agree that Seller shall make an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding election under state, local, and
foreign Tax law) (the "Section 338(h)(10) Election") with respect to the
purchase and sale of the shares of the stock of Rodeo and its Subsidiaries
that are U.S. corporations for United States federal income tax purposes
(each, a "338(h)(10) Entity").

  

  

(b) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully in making the Section 338(h)(10)
Election, including the filing of all required IRS forms and related forms
under state, local or foreign Tax law (collectively, the "Section 338 Election
Forms"). Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall prepare IRS Form 8023.
Seller shall permit Buyer to review and comment on such Form 8023 and shall
consider in good faith any comment or revision reasonably requested by Buyer.
On the Closing Date, Seller shall execute and deliver the fully completed Form
8023 to Buyer. Buyer shall file the Form 8023 on or prior to the due date for
filing such Form 8023.

  

  

(c) Within 120 days after Closing, Buyer shall prepare an allocation (the
"Asset Allocation") of the Purchase Consideration among the assets of the
338(h)(10) Entities in accordance with Sections 338 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and any comparable provisions of
state, local or other Tax law, and shall deliver the Asset Allocation to
Seller. Buyer shall permit Seller to review and comment on the Asset
Allocation and shall consider in good faith any comment or revision reasonably
requested by Seller within 20 days after delivery of the Asset Allocation by
Buyer. In the event an agreement regarding the Asset Allocation cannot be
reached, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain the Accountant to resolve the
dispute.

  

  

(d) Buyer, Seller and the 338(h)(10) Entities shall file all Tax Returns
(including but not limited to the Section 338 Election Forms and IRS Form
8883) consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and the Asset Allocation
and shall not voluntarily take any action inconsistent therewith upon any
audit or examination of any Tax Return or in any other filing or proceeding
relating to Taxes, unless required pursuant to a determination as defined in
Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar provision of any foreign, state or
local law; provided however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyer
or Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Governmental Entity based upon or arising out of the Asset Allocation, and
neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to litigate before any court any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Entity challenging the
Asset Allocation. If the Purchase Consideration paid by Buyer to Seller
pursuant to this Agreement is adjusted in any manner as provided in this
Agreement, Buyer shall promptly revise the Asset Allocation to reflect such
adjustments to the Purchase Consideration paid pursuant to this Agreement.
Buyer shall permit Seller to review and comment on such revised Asset
Allocation and shall consider in good faith any comment or revision reasonably
requested by Seller within 20 days after delivery of the revised Asset
Allocation by Buyer. In the event an agreement regarding the Asset Allocation
cannot be reached, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain the Accountant to
resolve the dispute.

ARTICLE 9.

  

  

OTHER POST-CLOSING COVENANTS

  

  

Section 9.1 Employee Related Matters.

  

  

(a) Employees.

  

  

(i) Schedule 9.1(a)(i)(A) sets forth a list of all the employees of the Parent
or its Affiliates (including the Rodeo Entities) who are engaged primarily in
the Business and certain "shared" personnel. Set forth in Schedule
9.1(a)(i)(B) is a list of all employees of the Business that the parties agree
Parent may approach to retain and not transfer. On or prior to the Closing
Date, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to transfer to the Rodeo
Entities (to the extent not already employed by a Rodeo Entity) the employment
of the employees listed in Schedule 9.1(a)(i)(A) that are not retained by
Parent or its Affiliates pursuant to the prior sentence; provided, however,
that no later than 10 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer may
deliver to Parent a list in writing of employees, each of which has a Seller
Retention Agreement, whom Buyer does not intend to become Rodeo Employees
(each such employee a "Designated Employee"), and Parent shall take such
action as is necessary (including, for example and in Parent's discretion,
transferring the individual to an entity that is not a Rodeo Entity or
terminating the individual's employment) to ensure that the Designated
Employees shall not become Rodeo Employees. Each Person who is employed by
any Rodeo Entity immediately prior to the Closing shall continue employment
with such Rodeo Entity, respectively, immediately following the Closing
without further action on the part of Buyer, Parent or Seller (such Persons
are referred to herein as "Rodeo Employees").

  

  

(ii) None of Buyer nor any Rodeo Entity shall have any liability on or after
the Closing Date for any severance, change of control payments, Seller
Retention Agreement or other post-termination compensation or benefits with
respect to the Designated Employees; provided, however, that if Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer hires as an employee or engages as a consultant any
Designated Employee during the eighteen-month period following Closing, Buyer
shall reimburse Seller for fifty percent (50%) of any and all amounts paid to
such Designated Employee by Seller as required under any Seller Retention
Agreement applicable to such Designated Employee within five Business Days
following the date of such hire or engagement.

  

  

(iii) For the period of time commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the
last day of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, the Buyer
shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Rodeo Employees employee benefits
that, in the aggregate, are substantially similar to employee benefits (other
than equity and cash incentives) provided to the Rodeo Employees immediately
prior to the Closing Date.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(b) 401(k) Plan. As soon as practicable (but no more than 30 days) after the
Closing Date, Rodeo Employees who were eligible to participate in the Seller
401(k) Plan on the Closing Date shall be eligible to participate in a 401(k)
Plan sponsored by Rodeo, Buyer, or an Affiliate of Buyer ("Buyer 401(k)
Plan"). As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the
assets and liabilities of the Seller 401(k) Plan attributable to all current
and former employees who are or were engaged primarily in the Business to be
transferred to the Buyer 401(k) Plan as a trust-to-trust transfer, and the
Buyer 401(k) Plan shall accept such transfer. After the Closing Date, neither
Seller nor its Affiliates shall have any liability with respect to the Buyer
401(k) Plan and Buyer shall be liable and shall indemnify Seller and its
Affiliates from and against all Liabilities with respect to the Buyer 401(k)
Plan. Seller shall take such action as is necessary to cause each Rodeo
Employee to have a fully nonforfeitable right in such Rodeo Employee's account
balance, if any, under the Seller 401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date.

  

  

(c) Pension Transition Payments; Retention Agreements.

  

  

(i) Each Rodeo Employee age 40 and above who had at least five years of
service on December 31, 2010 (as determined under Seller's 2011 Employee
Benefits Update dated October 2010) is entitled to "Transition Incentive"
payments as described in such 2011 Benefits Update ("Transition Incentives").
The amount of an employee's Transition Incentive payment is determined by
multiplying the employee's "annual compensation" by the employee's "annual
compensation percentage" (each as determined under such 2011 Employee Benefits
Update). Schedule 9.1(c)(i) lists the name and "annual compensation
percentage" for each employee who (A) is listed on Schedule 9.1(a)(i)(A) or
Schedule 9.1(a)(i)(B), and (B) is eligible to receive a "Transition
Incentive." Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Transition Incentive
payments to each Rodeo Employee listed on Schedule 9.1(c)(i), determined based
on the applicable "annual compensation percentage" listed on Schedule
9.1(c)(i).

  

  

(ii) At or immediately prior to Closing, Parent and/or Seller, as applicable,
shall cause to be assigned to Rodeo (1) the retention agreements listed on
Schedule 9.1(c)(ii)(A) for each Rodeo Employee listed thereon ("Employee
Retention Agreement") and (2) either (a) the transition agreements listed on
Schedule 9.1(c)(ii)(B) for each Rodeo Employee listed thereon ("Employee
Transition Agreements") or (b) for each Rodeo Employee who elects to surrender
such Employee Transition Agreement no later than 14 calendar days before the
Closing Date, a change in control agreement in the form attached as Schedule
9.1(c)(ii)(C) ("Employee CIC Agreements" and, together with the Employee
Retention Agreements and the Employee Transition Agreements, the "Seller
Retention Agreements"). Immediately after Closing, Rodeo shall have the
obligation to make any payments due under the Seller Retention Agreements,
except that Parent shall cause the restricted stock units referenced in the
Employee Transition Agreements that are outstanding but unpaid immediately
prior to the Closing Date (the "Seller RSUs") to be settled in cash as of the
Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, Rodeo shall have no obligation with
respect to Seller RSUs. After the Closing Date neither Seller nor its
Affiliates shall have any obligation with respect to the Seller Retention
Agreements, and Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates from and
against all Damages with respect to the Seller Retention Agreements, except as
follows: (1) Seller shall be liable for any and all Damages arising from a
breach by Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Rodeo Entities) of
any Seller Retention Agreements occurring prior to the Closing; (2) Seller
shall be liable for all Damages relating to or arising from the Seller RSUs or
the Joy Global equity award program; (3) within fifteen (15) days after
Buyer's delivery to Parent of written notice that payment has been made under
a Seller Retention Agreement, Parent shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to (I)
fifty percent (50%) of the portion of such payment, if any, attributable to an
Employee Retention Agreement, including any Employee Retention Agreement or
"Retention Award Plan" referenced in an Employee Transition Agreement, and
(II) one hundred percent (100%) of the portion of such payment, if any,
attributable to an Employee Transition Agreement or an Employee CIC Agreement
if the Buyer made such payment under the Employee Transition Agreement or the
Employee CIC Agreement as a result of the termination of the applicable
employee's employment within sixty (60) days after Closing.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(iii) On or before March 15, 2012, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to each
Rodeo Employee listed on Schedule 9.1(c)(iii) who remains employed by a Rodeo
Entity, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer on March 15, 2012 (or, if earlier, the
payment date), a cash bonus for calendar year 2011 in an amount no less than
the product of (A) the target bonus percentage for the Rodeo Employee listed
on Schedule 9.1(c)(iii), multiplied by (B) the Rodeo Employee's rate of annual
base salary as in effect as of December 31, 2011 (the total amount of such
payments, the "2011 Bonus Amount"). Within fifteen (15) days after Buyer's
delivery to Parent of written notice that the 2011 Bonus Amount has been paid
(which notice shall state the amount thereof), Parent shall pay to Buyer an
amount equal to the result of multiplying (A) the 2011 Bonus Amount by (B) a
fraction equal to (1) the number of days between January 1, 2011 and the
Closing Date divided by (2) 365.

  

  

(d) Welfare Benefits.

  

  

(i) Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, pursuant to employee welfare
benefit plans and arrangements established or maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates (the "Buyer Welfare Plans") (A) waive all limitations as to pre-
existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to Rodeo Employees under
Buyer Welfare Plans, other than limitations that are already in effect with
respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing
Date under the corresponding Employee Plan, and (B) provide each Rodeo
Employee with credit under Buyer Welfare Plans for any co-payments and
deductibles paid under the corresponding Employee Plans prior to the Closing
Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements for
the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs. To the extent not inconsistent
with applicable Legal Requirements, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate and vesting (but not benefit accrual) for Rodeo Employees under
all Buyer Welfare Plans, Buyer shall recognize service with the Rodeo Entities
and Parent to the same extent recognized under the corresponding Employee
Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date ("Rodeo Service"). In
addition, Buyer shall recognize Rodeo Service for purposes of determining the
rate of vacation accrual and the level of severance benefits, but not for
purposes of the rate of benefit accrual or level of benefits for any other
benefit. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.1(d) applies only with
respect to Buyer Welfare Plans that cover Rodeo Employees, and nothing in this
Section 9.1(d) shall require any Buyer Welfare Plan or other benefit plan or
program to cover any Rodeo Employees.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(ii) On or before the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the portion of the
Employee Plan covering Rodeo Employees that is a flexible spending plan under
Section 125 of the Code to be transferred to Rodeo as a separate flexible
spending plan ("Rodeo Flexible Spending Plan). Immediately after the Closing,
Rodeo Employees' elections and balances under the Rodeo Flexible Spending Plan
shall remain in effect under the Rodeo Flexible Spending Plan, and Rodeo or an
Affiliate of Rodeo shall continue to sponsor the Rodeo Flexible Spending Plan.
After the Closing Date, neither Seller nor its Affiliates shall have any
liability with respect to the Rodeo Flexible Spending Plan and Buyer shall be
liable and shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates from and against all
Liabilities with respect to the Rodeo Flexible Spending Plan.

  

  

(e) No Third Party Beneficiaries. Parent, Seller and Buyer acknowledge and
agree that (i) all provisions contained in this Section 9.1 with respect to
employees are included for the sole benefit of the respective Parties and
shall not create any right in any other Person, including any employees,
former employees, any participant in any plan or arrangement established or
maintained by Parent, Buyer, any Rodeo Entity or any of their Affiliates or
any beneficiary thereof, or any right to continued employment with Parent,
Seller, Buyer, any Rodeo Entity or any Affiliate thereof, (ii) nothing in this
Section 9.1 shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify an Employee Plan
or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement nor shall it
require any Rodeo Entity or any Affiliate thereof to continue or amend any
particular benefit plan after the consummation of the Transactions for any
employee or former employee of Seller or any Rodeo Entity or any Affiliate
thereof, and (iii) any such plan may be amended or terminated in accordance
with its terms and applicable Law.

  

  

Section 9.2 Post-Closing Access. Without limiting the obligations set forth in
Section 8.1, following the Closing, each party hereto agrees that it will
cooperate with and make available to each other party, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice, (i) all Books and Records related to the
Business or any Rodeo Entity, (ii) information related to the Business or any
Rodeo Entity and (iii) Rodeo Employees (without substantial disruption of
employment), in each case retained by such party and remaining in existence
after the Closing which are necessary or useful in connection with any audit,
investigation or dispute, any litigation or investigation or any other matter
requiring any such books and records and other documents, information or
employees for any reasonable business purpose. The party requesting any such
books and records and other documents, information or employees shall bear all
of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
providing such books and records and other documents, information or
employees. All information received pursuant to this Section 9.2 shall be kept
confidential by the party obtaining such information, subject to any
disclosure that is required to be made by such party in order to comply with
applicable Legal Requirements or the rules or regulations of any securities
exchange upon which its securities are traded. Parent also agrees that it will
take appropriate measures to ensure that following the Closing its employees
no longer have access to Books and Records or to any books and records, and
information or documents related to the Business or any Rodeo Entity that are
retained by Parent, except to the extent such books, records, documents or
information also reasonably relate to the business of Parent and to the extent
such access is necessary to perform Parent's or Seller's obligations under
this Agreement.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

Section 9.3 Publicity. On the date this Agreement is executed (or if executed
after the close of business, no later than the next opening of the NYSE),
Parent and the Buyer each intend to issue a press release with respect to the
execution hereof and the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as may be
required by Legal Requirements, any Order or any listing agreement with or
rule of any regulatory body, national securities exchange or association,
Parent and the Buyer shall consult with each other before issuing, and provide
each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
After the Closing Date, the provisions of this Section 9.3 shall not apply.

  

  

Section 9.4 Confidential Information. Buyer and Parent acknowledge and agree
as follows:

  

  

(a) The Parties acknowledge that the Transactions are of a confidential nature
and shall not be disclosed except to Representatives and Affiliates, or as
required by any applicable Legal Requirements, until such time as the Parties
make a public announcement regarding the Transactions as provided in Section
9.3. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated as of June 3, 2011, between Parent and Buyer shall terminate
with respect to information relating to the Business and Rodeo. Buyer
acknowledges that any and all other information provided or made available to
it by Parent (or its Representatives) concerning Parent or its Affiliates
(other than Rodeo) will remain subject to the terms and conditions of such
Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing.

  

  

(b) Parent acknowledges that it and its Affiliates and Representatives have
had and, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, will have access to
confidential and proprietary information related to Buyer, the Rodeo Entities
and the Business, in each case, potentially including technical, manufacturing
or marketing information, ideas, methods, developments, inventions,
improvements, business plans, trade secrets, scientific or statistical data,
diagrams, drawings, specifications or other proprietary information related
thereto, together with all analyses, compilations, studies or other documents,
records or data prepared by Parent, the Rodeo Entities or their respective
Representatives or Affiliates, which contain or otherwise reflect or are
generated from such information ("Confidential Information"). The term
"Confidential Information" does not include information which is or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by
Parent or its Affiliates.

  

  

(c) Parent shall treat all Confidential Information as confidential, preserve
the confidentiality thereof and not disclose any such Confidential
Information, except to their Representatives and Affiliates who need to know
such Confidential Information in connection with the Transactions. Parent
shall cause its Representatives to treat all such Confidential Information as
confidential, preserve the confidentiality thereof and not disclose any such
Confidential Information. Parent shall be responsible for any breach of this
Agreement by any of their Representatives. If, however, Confidential
Information is disclosed, Parent shall immediately notify Buyer in writing and
take all reasonable steps required to prevent further disclosure.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(d) If Parent or any of its respective Representatives or Affiliates is
requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for
information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative
demand or other similar process) or is required by operation of law to
disclose any Confidential Information, Parent shall provide Buyer with prompt
written notice of such request or requirement, which notice shall, if
practicable, be at least 48 hours prior to making such disclosure, so that
Buyer may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive
compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a
protective order or other remedy or the receipt of such a waiver, Parent or
any of their respective Representatives are nonetheless, in the opinion of
counsel, legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information, then Parent
may disclose that portion of the Confidential Information which such counsel
advises is legally required to be disclosed, provided that such party uses its
reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential
Information, whereupon such disclosure shall not constitute a breach of this
Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.5 Further Assurances. From and after the Closing Date, the Parties
shall cooperate reasonably with each other in connection with any steps
required to be taken in order for the Parties to carry out the intent of this
Agreement. Neither Parent, on the one hand, nor Buyer, on the other hand,
shall, without the prior written consent of the other party, take any action
or refrain from taking any action the intended result of which is to prevent
or materially impede, interfere with or unreasonably delay, the Transactions.
In furtherance of the foregoing, from time to time after the Closing Date, the
Parties hereto agree to (i) furnish upon request to each other such further
assurances, information, documents and instruments of transfer or assignment
and assumption and (ii) do such things and promptly execute, acknowledge, and
deliver any such further assurances, documents and instruments of transfer or
assignment and assumption, in each case that the other party may reasonably
request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this Agreement,
including taking such steps as are necessary to convey the Rodeo Stock to
Buyer, the Transferred Drilling Assets and the Assumed Drilling Liabilities to
Buyer or its designated Affiliate and the Retained Assets and Retained
Liabilities to Parent or its designated Affiliate. As promptly as possible
after the Closing Date, Parent, Seller, Buyer and each of their Subsidiaries
shall make any filings and/or give any notices required by applicable Legal
Requirements to be made or given by them in order to consummate the
Transactions that were not made or given prior to the Closing; and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all required Consents not obtained
prior to the Closing.

  

  

Section 9.6 Non-Competition.

  

  

(a) From the Closing Date until the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date
(the "Restricted Period"), without Buyer's consent, Parent shall not, and
shall cause each of its Affiliates (Parent and its Affiliates, the "Restricted
Party") not to, directly or indirectly (including by means of management,
advisory, operating, or similar agreements or arrangements or by any record or
beneficial equity interest, either as a principal, trustee, stockholder,
partner, joint venture or otherwise, in any Person), engage in a business that
competes with the Business, for their own account or for any other Person, in
any country or other geographic location in which any Rodeo Entity operates
the Business or otherwise had sales immediately prior to the Closing or any
other country or geographic location in which any Rodeo Entity planned to
operate the Business as of the Closing Date (the "Restricted Business");
provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement or in the definition of
Restricted Business shall prohibit or in any way restrict the Restricted
Party's ability to:

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(i) engage in the Restricted Business to the extent necessary to perform its
duties under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements;

  

  

(ii) make or maintain passive investments of less than five percent of the
outstanding equity securities in any entity engaged in the Restricted
Businesses listed for trading on any recognized securities exchange or in the
over-the-counter markets;

  

  

(iii) own an equity interest of any other Person engaged in the Restricted
Business acquired as a creditor in bankruptcy other than by a voluntary
investment decision; or

  

  

(iv) acquire the assets or capital stock or other equity interests of any
other Person engaged in the Restricted Business, provided, however, that the
net sales attributable to the Restricted Business conducted by such person
accounts for less than 25% of the net sales of such person for its most
recently completed fiscal year.

  

  

(b) The Parties agree that this covenant is personal to Buyer and Buyer may
not assign or otherwise transfer this covenant, in whole or in part, to any
Person other than to other Affiliates of Buyer. During the Restricted Period,
Parent shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, without the
prior written consent of Buyer, directly or indirectly, induce or attempt to
induce any customer, reseller, retailer, distributor, supplier, licensee or
other Person to cease doing business with Buyer or any Rodeo Entity or in any
way interfere with the relationship between any such customer, reseller,
retailer, distributor, supplier, licensee or other Person and Buyer, Rodeo or
such Rodeo Entity.

  

  

(c) Parent agrees that any remedy at law for any breach by it or its
Affiliates of Section 9.6(a) or (b) would be inadequate, and Buyer shall be
entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief in such case in addition to
any other right Buyer may have, whether at law or in equity. Each party
intends that the provisions of this Section 9.6 be enforced under the laws
applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. If any provision
of this Section 9.6 shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid or unenforceable, this Section 9.6 shall be amended to revise the
scope of such provision to make it enforceable, if possible, or, if not
possible, to delete such provision, in either case, without affecting the
other or remaining provisions of this Section 9.6 or this Agreement. Any
invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Section 9.6 in a
jurisdiction will not affect the validity or enforceability of that provision
in any other jurisdiction.

  

  

Section 9.7 Non-Solicitation.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(a) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, during the period from the Closing Date until the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, contact, approach or solicit for the purpose
of offering employment to or hiring (whether as an employee, consultant,
agent, independent contractor or otherwise), or hire, any person employed by
Buyer (with respect to the Business) or any Rodeo Entity (or their respective
Affiliates or successors-in-interest to the extent related to the Business)
(other than employees whose annual base compensation is less than $75,000).

  

  

(b) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, during the period from the Closing Date until the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, contact, approach or solicit for the purpose
of offering employment to or hiring (whether as an employee, consultant,
agent, independent contractor or otherwise), or hire, any person employed by
Parent (or its Affiliates or successors-in-interest), in either case for a
position with Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Rodeo Entities)
related to the Business (other than employees whose annual base compensation
is less than $75,000).

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that the provisions of
Section 9.7(a) and Section 9.7(b) shall not prohibit (i) the hiring of a
person whose employment was terminated by his or her respective employer (or
its Affiliates) and who was not solicited by the other party (or its
Affiliates) in violation of Section 9.7(a) or (b), as applicable, or (ii)
solicitation by way of general advertising, including general solicitations in
any local, regional or national newspapers or other publications or circulars
or on internet sites or any search firm engagement which is not directed or
focused on employees of Buyer, or Parent or their respective Affiliates as
applicable.

  

  

(d) The Parties agree that the restraints created by the covenants in this
Section 9.7 are no greater than necessary to protect the Parties' respective
legitimate interests, that damages would be an inadequate remedy and that a
Person seeking to enforce this Section 9.7 shall be entitled to seek specific
performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any breach hereof.
Furthermore, the Parties agree that such covenants do not hinder, or otherwise
cause hardship to, any party or its Affiliates with respect to finding other
employees or any party's or its Affiliates' employees with respect to finding
employment elsewhere. Similarly, the Parties agree that no party's need for
the protection afforded by the covenants of this Section 9.7 is outweighed by
either the hardship to any other party or its Affiliates or any public
interest. The existence of any claim or cause of action of a party against
another party, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not
constitute a defense to the enforcement by a party of the covenants contained
in this Section 9.7. Should any portion of the covenants in this Section 9.7

Section 9.9 Insurance. Upon the reasonable request of Buyer, Parent shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to assist
the Rodeo Entities or their respective transferee(s) or assignee(s) in
tendering claims for any loss, Liability, claim, damage or expense of the
Business, the Rodeo Entities or their respective transferee(s) or assignee(s)
(including products and current and former employees and directors thereof) or
of any of their respective predecessors and arising out of occurrences prior
to the Closing Date (a "Rodeo Insured Loss") to the applicable insurers under
any insurance policies covering, prior to the Closing Date, the Business or
the assets, businesses, operations, employees, officers or directors of the
Rodeo Entities or their respective predecessors, including but not limited to
the Insurance Policies, and to provide the Rodeo Entities or their respective
transferee(s) or assignee(s) with the proceeds of claims made by or with
respect to such Rodeo Insured Losses subject to the self-insured limits and
deductibles under the applicable policy, which shall be for the account of
Buyer. Subsequent to the Closing, Buyer or its transferee(s) or assignee(s)
shall assume responsibility for the administration and adjustment of all Rodeo
Insured Losses and Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Rodeo or its transferee(s) or
assignee(s) in such administration and adjustment when Parent's involvement is
required by an insurer or a particular insurance policy. Buyer shall reimburse
Parent for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such
assistance in the tendering, administration or adjustment of any claims. It is
understood that upon Closing, future coverage under any Insurance Policies
that are then currently in effect will not provide coverage with respect to
the Business or any Rodeo Entity (past, current and future) and their
respective businesses. Parent agrees that it will not object to any future
transfer or assignment that Buyer or any Rodeo Entity may choose to make of
any insurance-related causes of action arising under insurance policies (or
other insurance arrangements or contracts for the transfer or sharing of
insurance risks) covering the Business or the assets, businesses, operations,
employees, officers or directors of any Rodeo Entity or their respective
predecessors. In the event any such insurance policies have coverage triggers
other than occurrence (such as claims made or occurrences as reported) and
events unknown to Parent, Seller or any Rodeo Entity have occurred prior to
the Closing Date that could not have been reported to underwriters prior to
the Closing Date, it may not be possible for Buyer or the Rodeo Entities or
their respective transferees or assignees to access such policies. Further,
Parent, Seller and their Affiliates make no representation or warranty that
such insurance policies will respond to Buyer, the Rodeo Entities or their
respective transferees or assignees in the event claims are made subsequent to
the Closing Date.

Section 10.1 Termination Event. This Agreement and the Transactions may, by
notice given prior to or at the Closing, be terminated:

  

  

(a) by mutual agreement of Buyer and Parent;

  

  

(b) by Buyer, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, if the Closing
has not occurred (other than as a result of the failure of any party seeking
to terminate this Agreement to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement) on or before (i) February 29, 2012 or (ii) such later date as the
Parties may agree upon in writing (such applicable date specified in the
preceding clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to herein as the "Outside
Date");

  

  

(c) by Parent, on the one hand, or by Buyer, on the other hand, if a material
breach of this Agreement has been committed by the other party and such
material breach has not been cured within 30 days after notice thereof to such
other party or expressly waived in writing;

  

  

(d) (i) by Buyer if satisfaction of any of the conditions in Section 6.1
becomes impossible prior to the Outside Date (other than as a result of the
failure of Buyer to comply with its obligations under this Agreement) and
Buyer has not expressly waived such condition in writing on or before
termination of this Agreement; or (ii) by Parent, if satisfaction of any of
the conditions in Section 6.2 becomes impossible prior to the Outside Date
(other than as a result of the failure of Parent or Seller to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement) and Parent has not expressly waived such
condition in writing on or before termination of this Agreement; or

  

  

(e) by either Buyer or Parent if there shall be any Legal Requirement that
makes consummation of the Transactions illegal or otherwise prohibited or if
consummation of the Transactions would violate any non-appealable Order of any
Governmental Entity having competent jurisdiction.

  

  

Section 10.2 Effect of Termination. The Parties' termination rights under
Section 10.1 are in addition to any other rights they may have under this
Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of a right of termination hereunder
will not be an election of remedies. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 10.1, all further obligations of the Parties under this Agreement
will terminate; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated by
Buyer, on the one hand, because of the willful breach of this Agreement by
Parent or Seller, or Parent, on the other hand, because of the willful breach
of this Agreement by Buyer, or because one or more of the conditions to the
terminating Party's obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a
result of the other Parties' failure to comply with any of their obligations
under this Agreement, the terminating Parties' right to pursue all legal
remedies will survive such termination unimpaired; provided further, that the
provisions of Section 9.4, this Section 10.2, and Article 11 shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.
