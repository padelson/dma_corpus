 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

 



 

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of November 7, 2019, by and among (i) Digi International Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _Buyer_ "), (ii) Namath Merger Sub, Inc., a Utah
corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), (iii) Opengear, Inc., a Utah corporation (the
" _Company_ "), and (iv) Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado
limited liability company, solely in its capacity as representative, agent and
attorney-in-fact of the Effective Time Holders (" _Representative_ "). Buyer,
Merger Sub, the Company and Representative are referred to herein collectively
as the " _Parties_ " and each, individually, as a " _Party_."

 



 

 _RECITALS_

 



 

A. Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company in accordance with this Agreement and the URBCA (the
" _Merger_ "). Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to
exist, and the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer.

 



 

B. The board of directors of the Company has (i) approved this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated herein and in the Transaction
Documents (collectively, the " _Contemplated Transactions_ "), (ii) determined
that this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions are fair to, and in the
best interests of, the Company and its shareholders and (iii) resolved to
recommend that the Companys shareholders approve this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

C. This Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions have been approved by the
respective boards of directors of Buyer and Merger Sub.

 



 

D. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Buyer and Merger Sub to enter
into this Agreement, shareholders of the Company holding 90% of Company Common
Stock and all of the Company Preferred Stock, are executing and delivering
joinder agreements in the form of _Exhibit A_ (each, a " _Joinder Agreement_
" and collectively, the " _Joinder Agreements_ "), pursuant to which, among
other things, such holders will agree to vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger and to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement,
including the provisions set forth in _ARTICLE VII_.

 



 

E. As a condition and inducement to Buyers willingness to enter into this
Agreement, each Key Employee is simultaneously entering into an employment
arrangement, to be effective as of the Effective Time (the " _Employment
Arrangements_ ").

 



 

F. As a condition and inducement to Buyers willingness to enter into this
Agreement, each of the Effective Time Holders identified on _Schedule I_ is
simultaneously entering into a restrictive covenant agreement with the Company
and Buyer, to be effective as of the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Restrictive Covenant Agreements_ ").

 



 

G. Pursuant to the Merger (and on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement), among other things, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock and all
outstanding options to purchase shares of the

     

 

 



 

Company Stock shall be cancelled and, as and to the extent set forth in this
Agreement, converted into the right to receive cash and other potential
consideration as provided for herein.

 



 

 _AGREEMENT_

 



 

Now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants,
agreements and understandings contained herein and intending to be legally
bound, the Parties agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I _ 
DESCRIPTION OF THE TRANSACTIONS_

 



 

Section 1.1 _Merger of Merger Sub into the Company_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the
URBCA, and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will
continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ") as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer.

 



 

Section 1.2 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the URBCA.

 



 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, subject to the provisions
of this Agreement, the Parties will cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") with the Division of
Corporations and Commercial Code of the State of Utah in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the URBCA, and will take such other actions as may be
required by applicable Law to make the Merger effective as promptly as
practicable. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Articles
of Merger are accepted for filing by the Division of Corporations and
Commercial Code of the State of Utah or at such later date and time as is
specified by Buyer and the Company in the Articles of Merger (the " _Effective
Time_ ").

 



 

Section 1.4 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers_.
Unless otherwise determined by Buyer and the Company prior to the Effective
Time:

 



 

(a) the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the articles of
incorporation of the Merger Sub, except that the name of the Surviving
Corporation shall be "Opengear, Inc.;"

 



 

(b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as
of the Effective Time to conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving
Corporation will be "Opengear, Inc.;" and

 



 

(c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the Merger Sub, who
shall serve in such positions until their successors are duly elected or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 



 

Section 1.5 _Merger Consideration; Adjustments, Etc_. The Initial Merger
Consideration shall be determined on an estimated basis at Closing pursuant to
_Section 1.7_ below and then reconciled and adjusted after the Closing based
on the Closing adjustment items set forth

 



     

 

 



 

in _Section 1.8_ below. As used herein, the term " _Merger Consideration_ "
means: (a) the Initial Merger Consideration, at the Closing (including for
purposes of calculating the Closing payments under _Section 1.7(a)(i)_) and
at all times thereafter until the Final Merger Consideration is determined
pursuant to _Section 1.8_; or (b) the Final Merger Consideration, at such
time as the Final Merger Consideration is determined pursuant to _Section
1.8_ and _Section 1.17_ (with respect to any Earn-Out), and at all times
thereafter.

 



 

Section 1.6 _Escrow_. Of the Initial Merger Consideration otherwise payable at
the Closing, the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the General Escrow Amount shall
be deposited by Buyer at the Closing into separate accounts (the " _Escrow
Accounts_ ") with the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement for the purpose of
satisfying obligations of the Effective Time Holders. Each Effective Time
Holder shall contribute to the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the General Escrow
Amount in proportion to such Effective Time Holders Pro Rata Share. The
Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent to provide a means
of payment in accordance with _Section 1.8_ and shall be released as
described therein and in the Escrow Agreement. The General Escrow Amount shall
be held by the Escrow Agent to provide a means of payment in accordance with
_Section 1.8_ (to the extent the Adjustment Escrow Amount is exhausted),
ARTICLE VI and ARTICLE VII, and shall be retained until the date that is one
Business Day following the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date (subject
to the resolution of any pending claims), or until earlier released in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

Section 1.7 _Calculation and Payment of the Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(a) _Estimated Statement_. At least three Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Buyer and the Paying Agent a
reasonably detailed statement (the " _Estimated Statement_ ") in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer containing:

 



 

(i) the Companys good faith estimate of: (A) the Working Capital as of
immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Estimated Working Capital_ "), (B)
the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies as of
immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ "), (C) the
aggregate amount of Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction
Expenses_ "), (D) the Cash as of immediately prior to Closing (the "
_Estimated Cash_ "), (E) the Company Taxes Payable (the " _Estimated Company
Taxes Payable_ ") and (F) the Companys calculation of the Initial Merger
Consideration, in each case, prepared in accordance with GAAP, the accounting
policies, principles and procedures set forth on _Exhibit G_ (the "
_Accounting Principles_ ") and the definitions set forth in this Agreement
(with the terms of the Accounting Principles and this Agreement taking
precedence if they are not in accordance with GAAP); and

 



 

(ii) the Payout Spreadsheet.

 



 

The Estimated Statement and Payout Spreadsheet shall be based upon the records
of the Company and other information then available and the Company shall
provide Buyer and its representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice to the records of the Company and such
information used to prepare the Estimated Statement and Payout Spreadsheet and
its personnel to allow Buyer to verify the Estimated Statement and Payout
Spreadsheet. Each of the Company, Representative (on behalf of the Effective
Time Holders),

 



     

 

 



 

Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that each of them and the Paying
Agent will have the right to rely on the Payout Spreadsheet as setting forth a
true, complete and accurate listing of all amounts due to be paid by Buyer,
Merger Sub and the Company at the Closing. None of Buyer, Merger Sub, the
Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation will have any Liability with respect
to the allocation of proceeds among the Effective Time Holders resulting from
any payments made to such Persons pursuant to the Payout Spreadsheet. The
Effective Time Holders, by approving this Agreement, irrevocably on behalf of
all holders of Company Stock or Company Options, agree that all holders of
Company Stock or Company Options will cooperate with the Representative,
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent and the other holders of
Company Stock and Company Options to ensure that each such Person receives its
respective portion of any Merger Consideration that it is entitled to receive
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Payments at the Closing_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement,
promptly after the Effective Time:

 



 

(i) Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall pay (or cause to be paid) the
Estimated Indebtedness set forth in the Estimated Statement by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to each of the applicable lenders for which a
payoff letter is received pursuant to _Section 2.3(i)_;

 



 

(ii) Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall pay (or cause to be paid) the
Estimated Transaction Expenses set forth in the Estimated Statement by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to each of the applicable vendors for
which a final invoice is received at least two Business Days prior to the
Closing Date;

 



 

(iii) Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the General Escrow Amount, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, into escrow pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement;

 



 

(iv) Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) the Representative Reserve, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, in accordance with _Section 9.1(c)_; and

 



 

(v) Buyer shall deposit (or cause to be deposited), in each case, based on the
Initial Merger Consideration and as set forth in the Payout Spreadsheet:

 



 

(A) funds with the Paying Agent in an amount sufficient for the Paying Agent
to pay, as and when contemplated by _Section 1.12_ below (and only upon
receipt by the Company, the Paying Agent and Buyer, as applicable, of the
deliveries contemplated in such section), to each holder of Company Stock
(other than the Dissenting Shares or Cancelled Shares) an amount in cash equal
to the _product_ of (1) the number of (x) shares of Company Common Stock held
by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time plus (y) shares of
Company Common Stock that the shares of Company Preferred Stock held by such
holder immediately prior to the Effective Time are convertible into (which, in
each case, for the avoidance of doubt, shall exclude any Dissenting Shares or
Cancelled Shares) multiplied by (2) the Per-Share Merger Consideration
(calculated as of the Closing Date, i.e. with Additional Merger Consideration
and Earn-Out each deemed to be zero), as set forth on the Payout Spreadsheet,
in each case by wire transfer of immediately available funds or by electronic
check (ACH), as applicable, to the account designated

 



     

 

 



 

by such holder in such holders letter of transmittal in the form of _Exhibit
D_ (each a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "); and

 



 

(B) funds with the Surviving Corporation, for payment through payroll as and
when contemplated by _Section 1.10(a)_ below (and only upon receipt by the
Company and Buyer of the deliveries contemplated in such section), in an
amount sufficient to pay to each holder of Company Options such holders
Option Consideration, as set forth on the Payout Spreadsheet (which payment
will be net of any applicable withholding Taxes) to the account designated by
such holder in such holders Optionholder Acknowledgement.

 



 

Section 1.8 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) Within 90 calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to
Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in
reasonable detail Buyers calculation of the following items (each a "
_Closing Item_ "): (i) Working Capital of the Acquired Companies (as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 1.8_, the " _Final Working Capital_ "),
(ii) the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies as of
immediately prior to the Closing (as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 1.8_, " _Final Indebtedness_ "), (iii) the aggregate amount of
Transaction Expenses (as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 1.8_,
the " _Final Transaction Expenses_ "), (iv) the Cash as of immediately prior
to Closing (as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 1.8_, the "
_Final Cash_ "), (v) the Company Taxes Payable as of immediately prior to the
Closing (as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 1.8_, the " _Final
Company Taxes Payable_ ") and (vi) the resulting calculation of the Final
Merger Consideration.

 



 

(b) Representative shall have 30 calendar days within which to review Buyers
calculation of the Closing Items after Buyers delivery of the Closing
Statement. If Representative disputes any of the Closing Items, Representative
shall notify Buyer in writing of its objection to such Closing Item within
such 30-day period, together with a written description of the basis for and
dollar amount of such disputed items, all in reasonable detail (a " _Dispute
Notice_ "). The Closing Items, as set forth in the Closing Statement, shall
become final, conclusive and binding on the Parties unless Representative
delivers to Buyer a Dispute Notice within such 30-day period. If
Representative timely delivers a Dispute Notice, any amounts on the Closing
Statement not objected to by Representative in the Dispute Notice shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. Buyer and Representative shall,
within 45 calendar days following Buyers receipt of any Dispute Notice (the "
_Resolution Period_ "), attempt to resolve in writing their differences with
respect to the matters set forth in the Dispute Notice and any such resolution
shall be final, binding and conclusive. If, at the conclusion of the
Resolution Period, any amounts remain in dispute, then such items remaining in
dispute shall be submitted to and shall be resolved by Deloitte LLP (the "
_Dispute Firm_ "). The Dispute Firm shall be mutually engaged by Buyer and
Representative and shall review (acting as experts and not as arbitrators for
the purposes of such review) and determine only those issues set forth in the
Dispute Notice that remain in dispute and shall determine a value for any such
disputed item, in accordance with the provisions and definitions contained in
this Agreement, the Accounting Principles and GAAP, which is equal to or
between the final values proposed by Buyer and Representative and their
respective submissions. The Parties shall request that the Dispute Firm make a
decision with respect to all disputed items within 30 calendar days after the
submissions of the Parties, as provided above, and in any event as promptly as
practicable. Buyer and Representative will cause the Dispute Firm to deliver a
written report containing its calculation of the disputed items and a written
explanation in reasonable detail

 



     

 

 



 

of each required adjustment to the Closing Items, including the basis for
those adjustments as related to the provisions and definitions contained in
this Agreement, the Accounting Principles and GAAP. The Dispute Firms
determination shall be based solely on the relevant work papers and books and
records relating to the Company and the written information provided by Buyer
and Representative which are in accordance with the terms and procedures set
forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review) and
the Dispute Firm shall not conduct additional discovery in any form. Copies of
any materials and information provided by a Party to the Dispute Firm will be
concurrently provided to the other Parties. The decision of the Dispute Firm
shall be final and binding on all Parties, and the Closing Items, as
determined by the Dispute Firm, shall constitute the final and binding Closing
Items for purposes of determining the Merger Consideration, absent manifest
error. The decision rendered pursuant to this _Section 1.8(b)_ may be filed
as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any Party (in the case
of the Representative, at the Effective Time Holders expense) may seek
specific enforcement or take other necessary legal action to enforce any
decision made by the Dispute Firm. The other Partys only defense to such a
request for specific enforcement or other legal action shall be fraud by or
upon the Dispute Firm. Absent such fraud, such other Party (in the case of the
Representative, solely on behalf of the Effective Time Holders) shall
reimburse the Party seeking enforcement for its expenses related to such
enforcement.

 



 

(c) The reasonable fees and expenses of the Dispute Firm relating to the work,
if any, to be performed by the Dispute Firm will be allocated to
Representative (solely on behalf of the Effective Time Holders), on the one
hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion
of the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the amount actually
contested by such Party, as determined by the Dispute Firm. Buyer and
Representative shall promptly execute any reasonable engagement letter
requested by the Dispute Firm and shall each cooperate fully with the Dispute
Firm so as to enable it to make any requested determinations as quickly and as
accurately as practicable.

 



 

(d) During the 30 calendar day period from and after Representatives receipt
of the Closing Statement, Representative and its representatives shall be
permitted reasonable access during normal business hours to review the
Acquired Companies books and records related to Buyers preparation of the
Closing Statement. Representative and its representatives may make inquiries
of Buyer, the Acquired Companies and their respective accountants regarding
questions concerning, or disagreements with, the Closing Statement arising in
their review thereof, and Buyer shall use its, or shall cause the Acquired
Companies to use their, commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such
accountants to cooperate with and respond to such inquiries. From and after
Buyers receipt of a Dispute Notice until the end of the Resolution Period or,
if earlier, such time as the Closing Items are finally determined pursuant to
this _Section 1.8_, Buyer and its representatives shall be permitted
reasonable access during normal business hours to review Representatives
books and records relating to the Dispute Notice and the Closing Statement.
Buyer and its representatives may make inquiries of Representative and its
accountants regarding questions concerning, or disagreements with, the Dispute
Notice arising in their review thereof, and Representative shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such accountants to cooperate with
and respond to such inquiries.

 



 

(e) If the Final Merger Consideration as determined by this _Section 1.8_
exceeds the Initial Merger Consideration (such excess amount, if any, the "
_Excess Amount_ "), then Buyer

 



      

 

 



 

shall, or shall cause the Acquired Companies to, within five calendar days
after the Final Merger Consideration is finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 1.8_, deliver to the Paying Agent, with respect to payments in
respect of Company Stock, and the Surviving Corporation, with respect to
payments in respect of Cash-Out Options, sufficient funds to pay to each
Effective Time Holder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds or by
electronic check (ACH), as applicable, to the account designated by such
Effective Time Holder, an aggregate amount equal to such Effective Time
Holders Pro Rata Share _multiplied_ by the Excess Amount (it being understood
that payments in respect of Cash-Out Options will be made in accordance with
the Surviving Corporations normal payroll practices). If the Final Merger
Consideration as determined by this _Section 1.8_ is less than the Initial
Merger Consideration (such shortfall amount, if any, the " _Shortfall Amount_
"), then Buyer and Representative shall cause to be delivered to the Escrow
Agent a joint written statement directing the Escrow Agent to release from the
Adjustment Escrow Amount and, to the extent the Shortfall Amount exceeds the
Adjustment Escrow Amount, from the General Escrow Amount, an amount equal to
the Shortfall Amount, in each case within five calendar days after the Final
Merger Consideration is finally determined pursuant to this _Section 1.8_. If
there is an Excess Amount, or if the Shortfall Amount is less than the
Adjustment Escrow Amount, then Buyer and Representative shall cause to be
delivered a joint written statement directing the Escrow Agent to release to
the Effective Time Holders, in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, within
five calendar days after the Final Merger Consideration is finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 1.8_, as applicable (i) if there is an Excess
Amount, then the Adjustment Escrow Amount, or (ii) if there is a Shortfall
Amount, then the Adjustment Escrow Amount remaining after payment of the
Shortfall Amount to Buyer (it being understood that payments in respect of
Cash-Out Options may be released to the Surviving Corporation and paid in
accordance with the Surviving Corporations normal payroll practices).

 



 

Section 1.9 _Conversion of Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Conversion_. Subject to _Section 1.13_, at the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub,
the Company or any shareholder of the Company, each share of Company Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist or have any rights except for the right to
receive from Buyer, following the surrender of the certificate that
represented such share of Company Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time in accordance with _Section 1.12_, the following consideration:

 



 

(i) each share of Company Stock owned by Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be cancelled without payment of any consideration with respect thereto
the (" _Cancelled Shares_ ");

 



 

(ii) each share of Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive an
amount per share equal to the Common Stock Equivalent Shares with respect to
that share of Series B Preferred Stock multiplied by the Per-Share Merger
Consideration;

 



 

(iii) each share of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive an amount per

 



     

 

 



 

share equal to the Common Stock Equivalent Shares with respect to that share
of Series A Preferred Stock multiplied by the Per-Share Merger Consideration;

 



 

(iv) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per-Share Merger Consideration; and

 



 

(v) each share of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable share of common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Rounding_. The amount of cash, if any, that each shareholder of the
Company is entitled to receive for the shares of Company Stock held by such
shareholder shall be rounded to the nearest cent (with $0.005 being rounded
upward) and computed after aggregating the cash amounts payable for all shares
of Company Stock held by such shareholder, in each case as set forth on the
Payout Spreadsheet.

 



 

Section 1.10 _Treatment of Stock Options_.

 



 

(a) _Exercise or Cancellation of Options_. Company Options shall not be
continued, assumed, or substituted for by the Surviving Corporation or Buyer.
At least 30 calendar days prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide a
notice to the holders of Company Options, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Buyer, apprising them that all Company Options that are
unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, are cancelled at
the Effective Time and requesting that the holders thereof execute and deliver
to the Company either an Optionholder Acknowledgment in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit E_ (an " _Optionholder Acknowledgment_ ") or execute and
deliver an exercise notice for such Company Option, along with any amounts due
in connection with such exercise.

 



 

(b) _Option Payment_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, any portion of
any Company Option that is unvested shall, as to the portion that would vest
as of December 31, 2019, vest in full, any remaining unvested Company Option
shall be canceled, and each then-outstanding Company Option shall be cancelled
as follows:

 



 

(i) In the case of a Company Option having a per-share exercise price less
than the Per-Share Merger Consideration (calculated as of the Closing Date)
for the Company Common Stock and related to which Buyer receives a duly
executed Optionholder Acknowledgment (each a " _Cash-Out Option_ "), such
Company Option shall, to the extent then exercisable, be cancelled in exchange
for the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation (A) for each share of
Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Company Option, an amount
(subject to any applicable withholding Tax) in cash equal to the _product_ of
(1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to such
Company Option and (2) the amount by which the Per-Share Merger Consideration
(calculated as of the Closing Date) exceeds the per-share exercise price of
such Company Option and (B) such additional amounts as may be payable as
Additional Merger Consideration or Earn-Out; or

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) In the case of (A) any Company Option having a per-share exercise price
equal to or greater than the Per-Share Merger Consideration (calculated as of
the Closing Date) or (B) any Company Option related to which no duly executed
Optionholder Acknowledgment has been received by Buyer, such Company Option
shall be cancelled without the payment of cash or issuance of other securities
in respect thereof.

 



 

(c) The aggregate amount paid or payable in respect of the cancellation of the
Company Options as set forth in _Section 1.10(b)_ is referred to herein as
the " _Option Consideration_ ," which shall be subject to any applicable
withholding Tax and paid through the Surviving Corporations payroll system.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, where this
Agreement provides for Buyer to deposit any amount with the Surviving
Corporation for further distribution to the holders of Company Options, Buyer
need not deposit such amount to the extent that the readily available cash of
the Surviving Corporation is otherwise sufficient to fund such payments and
the related withholding Taxes or Buyer makes alternative arrangements for the
payment of the amounts due to holders of Company Options.

 



 

(d) _Company and Board Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company or
its board of directors, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take
any actions (including obtaining any consents) that may be necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this _Section 1.10_.

 



 

Section 1.11 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective
Time, holders of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company, and the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares
of such Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No
further transfer of any such shares of the Company Stock shall be made on such
stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a
valid certificate previously representing any of such shares of the Company
Stock (a " _Company Stock Certificate_ "), or other documentary evidence,
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, that legal and beneficial ownership of
Company Stock is vested in the holder thereof, is presented to the Surviving
Corporation or Buyer, such Company Stock shall be cancelled and shall be
exchanged as provided in _Section 1.12_.

 



 

Section 1.12 _Surrender and Payment_. If a holder of Company Stock surrenders
their Company Stock Certificates or other documentary evidence, reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer, that legal and beneficial ownership of Company Stock is
vested in the holder thereof, together with a completed Letter of Transmittal
and any other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent, in
accordance with the instructions set forth therein, at least two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date and such holder is the record holder as of the
Closing Date, then Buyer shall direct the Paying Agent to pay to the holder of
such Company Stock, promptly after the Effective Time, an amount in accordance
with _Section 1.7_. At or as soon as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement (and in any event within five Business Days following the execution
of this Agreement), the Company will send to the holders of Company Stock: (i)
a Letter of Transmittal and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for payment of the Per-
Share Merger Consideration relating thereto; _provided_ that the Company shall
afford Buyer a reasonable opportunity, and in any event not less than five
days, to review and comment upon such documents and shall incorporate Buyers
comments thereto prior to distribution. If a holder of Company Stock
surrenders their Company Stock Certificates, or provides other documentary
evidence, reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, that

 



     

 

 



 

legal and beneficial ownership of Company Stock is vested in the holder
thereof, together with a completed Letter of Transmittal any time after two
Business Days prior to the Closing Date and such holder is the record holder
as of the Closing Date, then the holder of such Company Stock shall be paid as
soon as reasonably practical thereafter. Upon surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate for exchange in accordance with the Letter of Transmittal (or upon
the submission of other documentary evidence, reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer, that legal and beneficial ownership of Company Stock is vested in the
holder thereof), together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal and such
other documents as may be reasonably required by Buyer or the Paying Agent, at
or after the Effective Time the holder of such Company Stock shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor payment of an amount equal to the Per-Share
Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Common Stock Equivalent
Shares so surrendered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
1.12_, each share of Company Stock shall be deemed, from and after the
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Per-Share Merger Consideration applicable thereto and no interest will be paid
or accrued for the benefit of such holder on the Merger Consideration payable
upon the surrender of such Company Stock. If any Company Stock Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Buyer or the Paying Agent may, in
its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the applicable
portion of Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit, in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the Paying Agent, and to
post a bond in customary amount as Buyer or the Paying Agent may reasonably
require, each of which provides for indemnity by such owner against any claim
that may be made against Buyer, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Company Stock Certificate. None of Buyer, the Company,
Merger Sub, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to
any Person in respect of any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any
portion of the Merger Consideration that remains undistributed to the holders
of Company Stock as of the second anniversary of the Closing (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any portion of the Merger Consideration
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity),
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law be delivered by the Paying
Agent to, and shall become the property of, the Surviving Corporation, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

Section 1.13 _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, mail or deliver to each holder of Company Stock entitled to receive
it, a letter from the Company providing such Persons with (i) a brief
information statement regarding the Company and the Contemplated Transactions,
(ii) the notification required by Section 704 of the URBCA with respect to the
Shareholder Written Consent, and (iii) notice in the manner contemplated in
Section 1322 of the URBCA of such Persons right to dissent to the Merger
pursuant Section 1302 of the URBCA. The Company shall afford Buyer a
reasonable opportunity, and in any event not less than five days, to review
and comment upon the documents described in this _Section 1.13(a)_ and shall
incorporate Buyers comments thereto.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
shares of Company Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time

 



     

 

 



 

and that are held by shareholders of the Company who (i) demand that the
Company purchase such shares at their fair market value in accordance with
Section 1323 of the URBCA and (ii) do not otherwise fail to perfect or
effectively withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the
URBCA and have not effectively withdrawn, lost or failed to perfect such
dissenters rights (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive a portion of the Merger
Consideration. Such shareholders instead shall be solely entitled to receive
payment from the Surviving Corporation of the appraised value of such
Dissenting Shares as agreed upon or determined in accordance with the
provisions of Part 13 of the URBCA, unless and until the holder of any such
Company Stock shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under the URBCA, as
provided in _Section 1.13(c)_. From and after the Effective Time, no
shareholder who has demanded appraisal rights shall be entitled to any rights
with respect thereto, except as provided in Part 13 of the URBCA. The Company
shall give Buyer prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the
Company, any attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
relating to dissenters rights under the URBCA, in each case, received by the
Company prior to the Closing. Buyer shall have the opportunity and the right
to direct all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior
to the Closing, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Buyer, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or
agree to settle, any such demand.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 1.13(b)_, if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) his, her or its dissenters rights, then, as of the
Effective Time, such holders shares of Company Stock shall automatically be
deemed to have been cancelled and retired and been converted into and
represent only the right to receive the consideration for Company Stock to
which such shareholder would otherwise be entitled under _Section 1.7_,
without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate representing such
shares and a completed Letter of Transmittal in accordance with _Section
1.12_.

 



 

Section 1.14 _Closing of Transactions_. The closing of the Contemplated
Transactions (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place by conference call and by
exchange of signature pages by email or fax at 9:00 a.m. Central Time on the
date that is the later of (a) the third Business Day following the
satisfaction or written waiver of all of the closing conditions set forth in
_Section 2.1_, _Section 2.2 _and _Section 2.3_ (other than conditions which
by their terms are required to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), and (b) the earlier of (i) a date
during the Marketing Period to be specified by Buyer on no fewer than three
Business Days notice to the Company and (ii) the third Business Day following
the final day of the Marketing Period (subject, in the case of each of
subclauses (i) and (ii) of this clause (b), to the satisfaction or written
waiver of all of the closing conditions set forth in _Section 2.1_, _Section
2.2 _and _Section 2.3_ (other than conditions which by their terms are
required to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions), or such other time or date as is mutually
agreeable to the Company and Buyer. The date of the Closing is referred to
herein as the " _Closing Date_ ," and the Closing shall be deemed effective as
of the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 1.15 _Withholding_. Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this
Agreement to each payee such amounts required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment

 



     

 

 



 

under the Code and Treasury Regulations or other applicable Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Buyer, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to such payee in respect of which such withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation or Buyer.

 



 

Section 1.16 _Income Tax Treatment_. The Parties agree that for U.S. federal
Income Tax purposes (and for purposes of any comparable provisions of state,
local or foreign Law): (a) the payment of the Per-Share Merger Consideration
by Buyer to each holder of Company Stock shall be treated as a taxable sale of
such Company Stock (as received by each such holder) to be governed by Section
1001 of the Code; and (b) the payment of the Option Consideration by Buyer to
the holders of Company Options (in addition to any other payments by Buyer to
the holders of Company Options with respect to such holders Company Options,
as expressly contemplated herein) shall be treated as a payment of the Option
Consideration by the Company to the holders of the Company Options (as
received by each such holder), as a transaction governed by Section 83 of the
Code.

 



 

Section 1.17 _Earn-Out Payments_.

 



 

(a) _Generally_. In addition to the consideration payable in connection with
the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Effective Time
Holders contingent earn-out payments (the " _Earn-Out_ ") of up to an
aggregate of $15 million, relating to the Consolidated Revenue from the sale
of Company Products during calendar years 2019 and 2020. The Earn-Out shall be
calculated, determined and paid in accordance with this _Section 1.17_.

 



 

(b) _Calculation_.

 



 

(i) If Consolidated Revenue from the sale of Company Products is greater than
or equal to $59.7 million (the " _2019 Revenue Threshold_ ") for the 12-month
period ending December 31, 2019 (the " _2019 Earn-Out Period_ "), the 2019
Earn-Out shall be an amount equal to (x) the amount by which Consolidated
Revenue for the 2019 Earn-Out Period exceeds the 2019 Revenue Threshold,
multiplied by (y) $3.43642612, up to a maximum payment of $5 million the ("
_2019 Earn-Out_ ").

 



 

(ii) If the Consolidated Revenue from the sale of Company Products is greater
than or equal to $69.635 million (the " _2020 Revenue Threshold_ ") for the
12-month period ending December 31, 2020 (the " _2020 Earn-Out Period_ "), the
2020 Earn-Out shall be an amount equal to (x) the amount by which Consolidated
Revenue for the 2020 Earn-Out Period exceeds the 2020 Revenue Threshold,
multiplied by (y) $2.72851296, up to a maximum payment of $10 million (the "
_2020 Earn-Out_ ").

 



 

(iii) In no event will (A) the 2019 Earn-Out exceed $5 million, (B) the 2020
Earn-Out exceed $10 million or (C) the total Earn-Out exceed $15 million.

 



 

(c) _Earn-Out Statements_. Buyer shall deliver to the Representative, within
60 days after the end of each of the 2019 Earn-Out Period and the 2020 Earn-
Out Period, (i) Buyers internally prepared income statement for the Company
Products during the applicable period and (ii) a statement setting forth the
calculation, in reasonable detail, of the applicable Earn-Out amount (each, an
" _Earn-Out Statement_ ").

 



     

 

 



 

(d) _Objections; Payment_. Each Earn-Out Statement and the amounts therein
will become final and binding upon the Parties and Effective Time Holders 30
days after Buyer delivers the Earn-Out Statement to the Representative, unless
the Representative gives Buyer a letter (a " _Disagreement Letter_ ") setting
forth with specificity those items with which Representative disagrees and the
reasons for each such disagreement. From the Closing Date until the final
determination of the 2020 Earn-Out, Buyer and its Affiliates shall prepare and
preserve all books and records necessary for the determination of the Earn-
Out. Buyer and its Affiliates shall permit the Representative (or a Person
appointed by the Representative) during such period, upon seven days prior
written notice and during regular business hours of Buyer, to review at
Buyers corporate offices, or another mutually acceptable location, such books
and records including all work papers used by Buyer and its Affiliates in the
determination of the Earn-Out. The Parties shall promptly seek to reconcile
any such disagreement set forth in the Disagreement Letter; if the Parties
fail to reach an agreement within 30 days after receipt by the Buyer of the
Disagreement Letter, then such disagreement shall be finally settled in
accordance with the procedures described in _Sections 1.8(b)_ and _(c)_ ,
_mutatis mutandis_. Each of the 2019 Earn-Out and the 2020 Earn-Out payments
shall be deposited with the Paying Agent (or the Surviving Corporation in
respect of payments related to Company Options) by Buyer, within five Business
Days after the Earn-Out Statement and the amounts included thereon are final,
for further payment to the Effective Time Holders in accordance with their Pro
Rata Shares (provided that holders of Company Options shall be paid through
the normal payroll procedures of the Acquired Companies).

 



 

(e) _Acknowledgment_. The Parties acknowledge that the payment of any Earn-Out
is speculative and subject to, among other things, the future performance of
Buyer and the Acquired Companies and general economic conditions, which cannot
be predicted with accuracy. Accordingly, the Parties make no representations,
warranties, covenants or guaranties as to future performance or the likelihood
of any payments pursuant to this _Section 1.17_.

 



 

(f) _Operation of the Acquired Companies_. From the Closing until the end of
the 2020 Earn-Out Period, Buyer and its Affiliates shall (i) operate the
business of the Acquired Companies in accordance and consistent with Buyers
historical practices, standard policies, procedures and terms of business and
(ii) not take any actions with the primary intent of avoiding making any
payments pursuant to this _Section 1.17_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Earn-Out payment shall be determined solely on the basis of the Consolidated
Revenues derived from the sale of Company Products and shall not include the
revenues of any other lines of business that are operated or acquired by Buyer
or its Affiliates after the date hereof.

 



 

(g) _No Employment Condition_. For the avoidance of doubt, payment of the
Earn-Out pursuant to this _Section 1.17_ is not conditioned on the employment
of any Effective Time Holder or any of their Affiliates or of Key Employees
with Buyer or an Acquired Company or any of their Affiliates after Closing.

Companies do not have any current or contingent Liability or obligation as a
consequence of at any time being considered a single employer under Section

the Code or is entitled to rely upon an opinion or advisory letter issued to
the sponsor of an IRS approved MandP or volume submitter plan document, and no
event has occurred and no circumstances exist which would adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Employee Benefit Plan. Each Foreign Benefit Plan
that is intended to qualify for favorable Tax treatment under the Laws of its
applicable jurisdiction satisfies the requirements for such favorable Tax
treatment.

failure to act or comply in connection with the administration or investment
of the assets of such Employee Benefit Plan that would result in any Liability
to the Acquired Companies.

 



 

(j) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.16(j)_ , neither the execution or
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Contemplated

of the Code) being imposed on such Person or any interest or penalty related
thereto.

(a) As of the date hereof, Buyer has received an executed debt commitment
letter dated on or before the date hereof (including all exhibits, schedules
and annexes thereto, the " _Commitment Letter_ ") from the Financing Sources

modified (provided that the existence or exercise of "flex" provisions
contained in the Debt Fee Letter shall not be deemed to constitute an

rescinded in any respect and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, there is no basis for
the withdrawal, termination or rescission of same. As of the date hereof, no

of the Financing will not be available to Buyer on the Closing Date. Buyers
obligations hereunder are not contingent upon procuring any financing.

representatives, is legally compelled to disclose any such confidential
information, such Person shall notify Buyer promptly of such event (if legally
permissible) so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order. If, in
the absence of a protective order, any Effective Time Holder, or any of their
respective Affiliates or representatives is, on the advice of counsel,
compelled to disclose any such confidential information to any Governmental
Entity or else stand liable for contempt, such Person may disclose the
confidential information, only to the extent necessary to comply with
applicable Law. The Effective Time Holders shall, and shall cause each of

disclose information (i) as required by Law, (ii) to the Representatives

Section 5.9 _Financing Matters_.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts (taking into account the
anticipated timing of the Marketing Period) to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing, including (i) at or prior to
Closing, to satisfy, or cause to be satisfied, or, if deemed advisable by
Buyer, obtain a waiver with respect to, all conditions applicable to Buyer to
funding in the Commitment Documents that are reasonably within its control;
(ii) at or prior to Closing, to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect thereto on the terms and conditions

 



     

 

 



 

(including any "flex" provisions contemplated by the Debt Fee Letter)
contemplated by the Commitment Letter (the " _Debt Documents_ ") or on other
terms that are no less favorable to Buyer than those contained in the
Commitment Letter (including any "flex" provisions contemplated by the Debt
Fee Letter); (iii) to comply with its obligations under the Commitment
Documents to the extent the failure to comply with such obligations would
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely impact the amount or timing
of the Financing or the availability of the Financing at Closing; and (iv) if
the conditions to the Financing have been satisfied, to consummate the
Financing at or prior to Closing.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall give the Company prompt written notice (i) of any material
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Commitment
Letter of which Buyer becomes aware, if such breach or default would
reasonably be expected to result in a material delay of, or materially limit,
the availability of the Financing or otherwise cause the proceeds of the
Financing not to be available at the Closing; (ii) if and when Buyer becomes
aware that it could reasonably be expected not to be able to obtain all or a
material portion of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Documents;
and (iii) of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication,
in each case, from a Financing Source identified in the Commitment Documents,
alleging (A) any actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Commitment Documents or any Debt Document, if
applicable, or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to the Commitment Documents (but excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with respect to the terms of the
Financing or Debt Documents) with respect to the obligation to fund the
Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing, in each
case, that would reasonably be expected to make the funding of the Financing
(or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) less likely to
occur or materially delay the availability of the Financing or otherwise cause
the proceeds of the Financing not to be available at the Closing. Without
limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the material developments
concerning the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing.

 



 

(c) If any portion of the Financing becomes or would reasonably be expected to
become unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment
Documents (after taking into account "flex" provisions contemplated by the
Debt Fee Letter), Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
arrange to obtain in replacement thereof alternative financing, including from
alternative sources, on Commercially Reasonable Terms in an amount sufficient,
when added to the portion of the Financing that is available and any cash of
Buyer and its Subsidiaries on hand at the Closing Date, to pay the Financing
Purposes (" _Alternative Financing_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the occurrence of such event, and the provisions of this _Section
5.9_ shall be applicable to the Alternative Financing, and, for the purposes
of this Agreement, all references to the Financing shall be deemed to include
such Alternative Financing and all references to the Commitment Documents or
any Debt Document shall include the applicable documents for the Alternative
Financing. " _Commercially Reasonable Terms_ " means debt financing terms
(including structure, covenants and pricing) available to the market from
major international or United States financing institutions to borrowers or
issuers with credit ratings comparable to Buyer (determined after giving pro
forma effect to the Contemplated Transactions) for financing comparable to the
type of financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter and the Debt Fee
Letter at the time the Alternative Financing is sought, and that does not
contain any term or condition (including "flex" provisions) to funding that
would be less favorable

 



     

 

 



 

to Buyer than those contained in the Commitment Letter and the Debt Fee Letter
or any terms that would reasonably be expected to delay or impede the
consummation of the debt financing thereunder beyond the Closing Date or be
less favorable in any material respect to Buyer with respect to enforceability
and confidentiality.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall not permit, without the prior written consent of the Company
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), any
material amendment or modification to be made to, or any termination,
rescission or withdrawal by Buyer of, or any material waiver by Buyer of any
provision or remedy under, the Commitment Documents that would reasonably be
expected to (i) reduce the aggregate cash amount of the Financing under the
Commitment Documents (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount thereof (except as set forth in any "flex" provisions
contemplated by the Debt Fee Letter)), or (ii) impose any new or additional
condition, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any condition, to the receipt
of any portion of the Financing in a manner that would (A) delay or prevent
the Closing Date or otherwise cause the proceeds of the Financing not to be
available at the Closing; or (B) make the funding of any portion of the
Financing (or satisfaction of any condition to obtaining any portion of the
Financing) less likely to occur (it being understood and agreed that, in any
event, Buyer may amend the Commitment Letter to add lenders, arrangers,
bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities that have not executed the
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and consent to the assignment after
the date hereof of lending commitments under the Commitment Letter to other
lenders).

the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with ARTICLE
VIII, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and the

Company and their respective Affiliates and each of their respective senior

including furnishing records, data or other information necessary to support
any statistical information or claims relating to the Companys business

(iii) cooperating with Buyers legal counsel in connection with providing
information as is reasonably necessary for Buyers legal counsel to provide

_Section 5.9(f)_).

 



 

Buyer shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) paid by the Company (prior to the Closing Date) or
any of its Affiliates or their respective representatives in connection with
the Financing or any Alternative Financing or any of the Companys obligations
under this _Section 5.9_.

 



 

(g) The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of the Acquired
Companies logos in connection with the Financing or any Alternative
Financing; provided, however, that such logos are used solely in a manner that
is not intended, or reasonably likely, to harm or disparage the Acquired
Companies or the reputation or goodwill of the Acquired Companies.

 



 

(h) Neither the Acquired Companies nor any of their respective Affiliates
shall have Liability to Buyer in respect of any financial statements, other
financial information or data or other information or cooperation provided
pursuant to this _Section 5.9_ except as expressly provided in this
Agreement.

 



 

(i) The Acquired Companies shall not announce, issue, offer, place or arrange
any competing debt securities or commercial bank or other syndicated credit
facilities (excluding (i) the Financing, (ii) indebtedness of the Acquired
Companies permitted to be incurred or issued prior to, or to remain
outstanding upon, Closing and (iii) other indebtedness incurred in the
Ordinary Course of Business of the Acquired Companies for capital
expenditures) if such announcement, issuance, offering, placement or
arrangement could reasonably be expected to materially impair the primary
syndication of the Financing.

 



 

Section 5.10 _280G Approval_. The Acquired Companies shall (a) no later than
five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, solicit from each "disqualified
individual" with respect to any Acquired Company (within the meaning of
section 280G(c) of the Code) who could otherwise receive any payment or
benefits that would constitute a "parachute payment" (within the meaning of
section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code) a waiver of such disqualified individuals
rights to some or all of such payments or benefits (the " _Waived 280G
Benefits_ ") so

 



     

 

 



 

that all remaining payments or benefits, if any, shall not be deemed to be
"excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of section 280G of the Code)
and (b) no later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, with
respect to each individual who agrees to the waiver described in clause (a),
submit to a shareholder vote (along with adequate disclosure satisfying the
requirements of section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and any regulations
promulgated thereunder) the right of any such "disqualified individual" to
receive the Waived 280G Benefits. The Company shall provide drafts of such
waivers and approval materials to Buyer for its review and comment no later
than two Business Days prior to soliciting such waivers and soliciting such
approval, and the Company shall consider any comments provided by Buyer in
good faith. If any of the Waived 280G Benefits fail to be approved in
accordance with the requirements of section 280G(b)(5)(B) as contemplated
above, such Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or provided. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer evidence reasonably acceptable to
Buyer that a vote of the shareholders of the Company was solicited in
accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.10_ and that
either (i) the requisite number of votes of the shareholders of the Company
was obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits (the " _280G Approval_
") or (ii) the 280G Approval was not obtained, and, as a consequence, the
Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or provided.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Further Assurances_. From the date of this Agreement until the
Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement, the Parties shall
act in good faith and (other than the Representative) use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to cause
the conditions specified in ARTICLE II to be satisfied and to consummate and
make effective the Contemplated Transactions as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof.

 



 

ARTICLE VI _ 
CERTAIN TAX MATTERS_

 



 

Section 6.1 _Certain Tax Matters_. The following provisions shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as between Buyer, the Company and the Effective
Time Holders for certain Tax matters following the Closing Date:

 



 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of Taxes arising in a Straddle
Period: (i) the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income, sales,
receipts, or payroll of the Acquired Companies for the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two
taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and
the other which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date,
and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Acquired Companies
for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable years or
periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the
Company were closed at the close of the Closing Date and (ii) the amount of
other Taxes of the Acquired Companies for a Straddle Period that relates to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in the taxable period ending on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days
in such Straddle Period.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared (and shall file or cause to be
filed) all Tax Returns for the Acquired Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (but excluding

 



     

 

 



 

Straddle Periods) consistent with the Acquired Companies past practice. Buyer
shall permit Representative to review and comment on each Pre-Closing Tax
Period Tax Return at least 30 days before such Tax Return is required to be
filed and shall make any changes reasonably requested by Representative.
Following the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the
Taxes shown as payable on such Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Returns, subject to
any right of Buyer to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement. Unless
otherwise required by applicable Law, Buyer shall not, and shall not cause or
permit any Acquired Company, to (i) amend any such Tax Returns filed with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Periods in any manner adverse to the Effective
Time Holders, or (ii) make any Income Tax election that has retroactive effect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Periods, in each case without the prior written consent
of Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all
other Tax Returns required to be filed by the Acquired Companies. Buyer shall
provide Representative with each Tax Return for any Straddle Period no later
than 30 days prior to the due date for such Tax Return (taking into account
applicable extensions of time to file) for Representatives review. Buyer
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay or cause to be paid all Taxes
with respect to such Straddle Period Tax Returns, subject to Buyers right of
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement with respect to the Taxes of such
Straddle Period attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
and including the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Straddle Taxes_ ") as
determined in accordance with _Section 6.1(a)_.

 



 

(c) Any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer or the Acquired Companies, and
any amounts credited against Tax in lieu of a cash Tax refund to which Buyer
or any of the Acquired Companies become entitled, that relate to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, except to the extent of refunds or credits related to the
claiming of an Australian Foreign Income Tax Offset in accordance with the
Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the impact of such on the Acquired
Companies United States Tax Returns, shall be for the account of the
Effective Time Holders (excluding any refund or credit attributable to any
loss in a Tax year or portion thereof beginning after the Closing that is
carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period). Within ten Business Days thereof,
Buyer shall pay over to the Paying Agent (or the Surviving Corporation in
respect of Company Options) on behalf of the Effective Time Holders any refund
to which the Effective Time Holders are entitled received or the amount of any
such credit applied to actually reduce Taxes.

 



 

(d) Buyer, the Acquired Companies, and Representative shall cooperate fully,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Parties, in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the other Partys request) the provision of records and information reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Buyer, the
Acquired Companies and Representative agree to retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Companies relating to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period until expiration of the statute
of limitations (taking into account any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any Tax authority.

 



 

(e) Any dispute under this _Section 6.1_ shall be referred to the Dispute
Firm. The Parties shall make consistent use of the final determination made by
the Dispute Firm for all

 



      

 

 



 

Tax purposes. The fees and costs of the Dispute Firm shall be borne by the
Buyer, on one hand, and Representative (solely on behalf of the Effective Time
Holders), on the other hand, as described in _Section 1.8(c)_, _mutatis
mutandis_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, any adjustments made
pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ shall be treated as adjustments to the Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(f) After the Closing, Buyer shall notify Representative in writing of the
proposed assessment or the commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or
judicial proceeding or of any demand or claim on the Acquired Companies ("
_Tax Proceeding_ ") which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer, could be
grounds for payment of Taxes by the Effective Time Holders under this
Agreement. After the Closing, Representative shall notify Buyer in writing of
any Tax Proceeding relating to the Acquired Companies, notice of which is
received by the Effective Time Holders or any of their Affiliates with respect
to any taxable period. Notices required to be given by or to Buyer or the
Representative shall contain factual information (to the extent known to the
Buyer or Representative, as the case may be) describing the asserted Tax
Liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other
document received from any Tax authority in respect of any such asserted Tax
Liability. In the case of a Tax Proceeding that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period that is not part of a Straddle Period, Representative shall conduct and
defend such Tax Proceeding, provided the Surviving Corporation and Buyer shall
have the right to participate (at their own expense) in any such Tax
Proceeding. If Representative fails to conduct a defense of any such Tax
Proceeding, the Surviving Corporation and Buyer may do so and may settle or
compromise the Tax Proceeding at their sole discretion. Representative (solely
on behalf of the Effective Time Holders) will reimburse the Surviving
Corporation or Buyer for all reasonable expenses incurred in this event. The
Surviving Corporations or Buyers right to participate shall include the
right to receive copies of all correspondence from any Tax authority relating
to such Tax Proceeding, attend meetings and review and comment on submissions
relating to any such Tax Proceeding, and Representative shall consider in good
faith any comments provided by the Surviving Corporation or Buyer.
Representative may not settle or compromise any Tax Proceeding for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period without prior written consent of Buyer. The Surviving
Corporation or Buyer shall conduct and defend any Tax Proceeding that relates
to a Straddle Period. Representative may participate at the Effective Time
Holders expense. The Surviving Corporation or Buyer may settle or compromise
any Tax Proceeding that relates to a Straddle Period. This _Section 6.1(f)_,
and not ARTICLE VII, shall apply to any Tax Proceedings.

 



 

(g) Buyer and Representative further agree, upon request from the other, to
use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Tax authority or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed.

 



 

(h) All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or
involving the Acquired Companies shall be terminated as of the Closing Date
and, after the Closing Date, no Acquired Company shall be bound thereby or
have any Liability thereunder.

 



     

 

 



 

ARTICLE VII _ 
INDEMNIFICATION_

 



 

Section 7.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. All representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement or in any
writing or certificate delivered in connection with this Agreement shall
survive the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing and except with
respect to fraud, no Party shall be entitled to recover for any Loss pursuant
to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 7.2(b)(i)_ unless written notice of a
claim thereof is delivered to the applicable Party prior to the Applicable
Limitation Date. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Applicable
Limitation Date_ " means the date that is the 18-month anniversary of the
Closing Date; _provided_ , that the Applicable Limitation Date in respect of a
breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental Representation shall be the date that
is 90 calendar days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations. Any matter as to which a claim has been asserted by timely notice
that is pending or unresolved at the end of the Applicable Limitation Date
will continue to be covered by this Agreement until such matter is finally
terminated or otherwise resolved under this Agreement or by a court of
competent jurisdiction, and any amounts payable under this Agreement are
finally determined and paid. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
claims for willful breach, intentional misrepresentation, or fraud on the part
of any party shall survive indefinitely.

 



 

Section 7.2 _General Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 7.2(c)_, each of the Effective Time Holders,
severally (and not jointly) pro rata based upon each Effective Time Holders
Pro Rata Share (except to the extent paid from the General Escrow Amount, in
which case such indemnity shall be joint and several), agrees to indemnify and
defend the Buyer Indemnified Parties and save and hold each of them harmless
from and against and pay on behalf of or reimburse such Buyer Indemnified
Parties for any and all Losses which any such Buyer Indemnified Party may
suffer, sustain or become subject to as a result of, arising from, in
connection with, by virtue of or related to:

 



 

(i) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of the Acquired
Companies set forth in ARTICLE III or in any Transaction Document delivered by
any Acquired Company or any Effective Time Holder, in all cases without giving
effect to any qualifications as to materiality, Material Adverse Effect or
similar qualifications;

 



 

(ii) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other
provision by the Company or any Effective Time Holder under this Agreement,
the Schedules or any certificate furnished by or on behalf of the Company or
Effective Time Holders pursuant to this Agreement which covenant, agreement or
other provision, with respect to the Company, is required to be performed on
or prior to the Closing;

 



 

(iii) any Transaction Expenses to the extent not included in Final Transaction
Expenses or any Indebtedness to the extent not included in Final Indebtedness;

 



 

(iv) any claims arising out of the inaccuracy of the information set forth on
the Payout Spreadsheet;

 



     

 

 



 

(v) any claims arising out of or related to the cancellation of the Company
Options;

 



 

(vi) Pre-Closing Taxes (except to the extent of an increase to Pre-Closing
Taxes related to the claiming, after the Closing, of an Australian Foreign
Income Tax Offset in accordance with the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and
the impact of such on the Acquired Companies United States Tax Returns);

 



 

(vii) the matters identified on _Schedule 7.2(a)(vii)_ ; and

 



 

(viii) any claim for appraisal or dissenters rights, including any payment in
respect of Dissenting Shares in excess of the Per-Share Merger Consideration.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall indemnify and defend the Effective Time Holders and save and
hold each of them harmless from and against any Losses which the Effective
Time Holders may suffer, sustain or become subject to as a result of, in
connection with or by virtue of (i) any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty of Buyer or Merger Sub under this Agreement or in
any Transaction Document delivered by Buyer or Merger Sub, in all cases
without giving effect to any qualifications as to materiality, material
adverse effect or similar qualifications or (ii) any breach or non-fulfillment
of any covenant, agreement or other provision by Buyer or Merger Sub under
this Agreement, the Schedules or any certificate furnished by or on behalf of
Buyer or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Effective Time Holders shall not be liable to Buyer Indemnified
Parties for any Loss pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ (other than with respect
to Fundamental Representations) until the aggregate amount of all such Losses
that the Effective Time Holders would, but for this clause, be liable exceeds
$700,000 in the aggregate (the " _Deductible_ "), in which case the Effective
Time Holders shall be liable for all such Losses in excess of the Deductible.
In addition, the Effective Time Holders shall not be liable to Buyer
Indemnified Parties for any Loss pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ (other than
with respect to Fundamental Representations) to the extent the aggregate
amount of all Losses previously indemnified by the Effective Time Holders
pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ (other than with respect to Fundamental
Representations) exceeds $14 million (the " _Cap_ "). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, the Deductible and the Cap shall not apply
with respect to any Loss arising from or related to (and such Loss shall not
be counted toward the Cap) (1) fraud, (2) breaches or inaccuracies of the
Fundamental Representations, or (3) the matters set forth in _Section
7.2(a)(ii)_ through _(viii)_. Absent a claim for fraud, each Effective Time
Holders maximum liability pursuant to this _ARTICLE VII_ shall be limited to
an amount equal to such Effective Time Holders Pro Rata Share _multiplied_ by
the sum of $140 million plus the amount of any Earn-Out earned pursuant to
_Section 1.17_.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall not be liable to the Effective Time Holders for any Loss
pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)(i)_ (other than with respect to Fundamental
Representations) until the aggregate amount of all such Losses that Buyer
would, but for this clause, be liable exceeds the Deductible, in which case
Buyer shall be liable for all such Losses in excess of the Deductible. In
addition, Buyer shall not be liable to the Effective Time Holders for any Loss
pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)(i)_ (other than with respect to Fundamental
Representations) to the extent the aggregate amount of all Losses previously
indemnified by Buyer pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)(i)_ (other than with respect
to Fundamental Representations) exceeds the Cap. Notwithstanding

 



     

 

 



 

anything to the contrary contained herein, the Deductible and the Cap shall
not apply with respect to any Loss arising from or related to (and such Loss
shall not be counted toward the Cap) (1) fraud, (2) breaches or inaccuracies
of the Fundamental Representations, or (3) the matters set forth in _Section
7.2(b)(ii)_. Absent a claim for fraud, Buyers maximum liability pursuant to
this _ARTICLE VII_ shall be limited to an amount equal to the Final Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(e) Each Person entitled to indemnification under this _Section 7.2_
acknowledges that it has a duty to take commercially reasonable steps required
by applicable Law to mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of any event
which gives rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder
or in connection herewith. The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification
under _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ shall be calculated net of any
insurance proceeds actually recovered by the Indemnitee, net of any
retropremiums and costs of recovery actually incurred by the Indemnitee in
procuring such proceeds or recovery, if any. In the event that an insurance
recovery is made by any Indemnitee with respect to any Loss for which any such
Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate
amount of such recovery, up to the amount indemnified, shall be made promptly
to the Indemnitor, net of any retropremiums and costs of recovery actually
incurred following the Closing by the Indemnitee in procuring such proceeds,
if any.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Manner of Payment; Right of Offset_. Any indemnification payable
to a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ shall be payable
(a) first, in Buyers sole discretion, either (i) as an offset against any
amounts then owed pursuant to the Earn-Out or (ii) from the General Escrow
Amount, and (b) second, in the event the General Escrow Amount is exhausted
and no amounts are then owed pursuant to the Earn-Out, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement, by recovery from each of the
Effective Time Holders, severally (and not jointly) pro rata based on their
respective Pro Rata Shares. All indemnification payments under this ARTICLE
VII shall be deemed adjustments to the Final Merger Consideration. If Buyer
elects to offset any amounts owed pursuant to this ARTICLE VII against any
Earn-Out, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of Earn-Out otherwise payable by Buyer
will be deemed to have been so paid and then repaid by the Effective Time
Holders, and will be reported in that manner on all Tax forms and other
required filings.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Claims_.

 



 

(a) Any party making a claim for indemnification under _Section 7.2_ (an "
_Indemnitee_ ") shall notify the indemnifying party (which, as it applies to
the Effective Time Holders, shall mean Representative, except for provisions
relating to an obligation to make or a right to receive any payments) (an "
_Indemnitor_ ") of the claim in writing as promptly as practicable, but in any
event within 30 days following receiving written notice of any Proceeding or
other claim against it (if by a third party), describing in reasonable detail
the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable), and the basis
thereof; _provided_ that the failure to so notify an Indemnitor shall not
relieve an Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that
(and only to the extent that) an Indemnitor is prejudiced thereby in its
ability to defend the claim, in which case such Loss shall be reduced by the
amount that reasonably could have been avoided had the indemnifying party been
promptly notified. If the Indemnitor shall object to such notice of claim, the
Indemnitor shall simultaneously deliver a notice to the Indemnitee and, if an
Effective Time Holder is the Indemnitor, to the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement, within

 



     

 

 



 

20 Business Days after the Indemnitees delivery of the notice of claim. If a
notice of objection shall not have been so delivered within such 20 Business
Day period, all Indemnitors shall be conclusively deemed to have acknowledged
the correctness of the claim or claims specified in the applicable notice for
the full amount thereof, and the indemnifiable Losses set forth therein shall
be promptly paid to the Indemnitees in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Any Indemnitor (which, as it applies to the Effective Time Holders, shall
mean Representative) shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
Proceeding or other claim giving rise to an Indemnitees claim for
indemnification at such Indemnitors expense (in the case of the
Representative, at the Effective Time Holders expense). If an Indemnitor
acknowledges that a third party claim is a claim for which the Indemnitor must
indemnify the Indemnitee, then the Indemnitor may elect to conduct the defense
thereof using counsel reasonably acceptable to the applicable Indemnitee;
_provided_ that (i) the Indemnitor shall notify the Indemnitee of its election
to defend such claim within 20 Business Days after delivery of the notice
described in _Section 7.4(a)_, (ii) the Indemnitee shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice
for such purpose, so long as all fees and expenses of such separate counsel
shall be borne by the Indemnitee, provided, however, that such Indemnitee
shall be entitled to participate in such defense with separate counsel at the
expense of the Indemnitor (in the case of the Representative, at the Effective
Time Holders expense) if so requested by the Indemnitor to participate, or if
representation of both the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor by the same counsel
would create a non-waivable conflict of interest (or potential non-waivable
conflict of interest), (iii) Representative (on behalf of the Effective Time
Holders) shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense if (A) the
claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation or otherwise seeks
a finding or admission of a violation of Law by the Indemnitee, (B) the claim
seeks relief against the Buyer Indemnified Party other than the payment of
monetary damages or could result in the imposition of an Order, injunction or
decree, (C) the Buyer Indemnified Party reasonably believes in good faith that
the Loss relating to such claim could exceed the maximum amount that the Buyer
Indemnified Party could then be entitled to recover under the applicable
provisions of this ARTICLE VII, or (D) the claim relates to any ongoing
business of the Indemnitee or has been initiated by a Governmental Entity, and
(iv) if an Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim, such
Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee before
entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim. The
Indemnitor shall not settle or compromise any such third-party claim, unless
the Indemnitee is given a full, complete and unconditional release of any and
all Liability by all relevant parties relating thereto. If the Indemnitor
fails or is unable so to elect to assume the primary defense of any such
third-party claim, the Indemnitee may (but need not) do so.

 



 

(c) The Parties shall cooperate with each other with respect to the defense of
any third-party claims and shall keep each other reasonably informed with
respect thereto.

 



 

(d) Each Indemnitee and Indemnitor shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with applicable
Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and others
representing any party to a third-party claim to be made so as to preserve any
applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Claims Unaffected by Investigation_. The right of a Buyer
Indemnified Party to indemnification or to assert or recover on any claim
shall not be affected by

 



     

 

 



 

any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the Closing
Date, with respect to the accuracy of or compliance with, any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document. The waiver of any condition based
on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or agreement, shall not affect the right to
indemnification or other remedy based on such representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Except with respect
to claims for (a) specific performance of covenants and agreements, (b) fraud
and (c) any Tax matters under _Section 6.1_, following the Closing,
indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VII shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Buyer and Effective Time Holders and any parties claiming by or
through such parties (including the Buyer Indemnified Parties) related to or
arising from any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in, or otherwise pursuant to, this Agreement and none of Buyer,
Merger Sub, the Company, or any Effective Time Holder shall have any other
rights or remedies in connection with any breach of this Agreement or any
other Liability arising out of the negotiation, entry into or consummation of
the Contemplated Transactions, whether based on contract, tort, strict
liability, other Laws or otherwise, except in the case of any cause of action
based on fraud. All representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement
are contractual in nature only and subject to the sole and exclusive remedies
set forth in this ARTICLE VII. For the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments
made to the Final Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.8_ shall not be
considered "remedies" for purposes of this _Section 7.6_ and shall not be
limited by the terms of this _Section 7.6_. Nothing in this _Section 7.6_
shall alter any Persons rights in the case of fraud.

 



 

ARTICLE VIII _ 
TERMINATION_

 



 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and the Company;

 



 

(b) by written notice from Buyer to the Company, if the Effective Time Holders
or the Company breaches any of its respective representations or warranties in
this Agreement or any of the Effective Time Holders or Company breaches or
fails to perform any of their respective covenants contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would render a condition
precedent to Buyers and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions set forth in _Section 2.1_ or _Section 2.3_ not
capable of being satisfied, and (ii) after the giving of written notice of
such breach or failure to perform to the Company, cannot be cured or has not
been cured by the earlier of the Outside Date and ten Business Days after the
delivery of such notice;

 



 

(c) by written notice from the Company to Buyer, if Buyer or Merger Sub
breaches any of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement
or Buyer or Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform any of its covenants
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would
render a condition precedent to Companys and Effective Time Holders
obligations to consummate the Contemplated Transactions set forth in _Section
2.1_ or

 



     

 

 



 

 _Section 2.2_ not capable of being satisfied, and (ii) after the giving of
written notice of such breach or failure to perform to Buyer, cannot be cured
or has not been cured by the earlier of the Outside Date and ten Business Days
after the delivery of such notice;

 



 

(d) by either Buyer or the Company, by written notice to the other, if any
applicable Law is in effect that prohibits or otherwise makes the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions illegal or any final and non-appealable Order
is in effect prohibiting, restraining, materially delaying, restructuring,
enjoining or restricting the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions;
_provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(d)_ shall not be available to (i) Buyer, if the failure of Buyer
or Merger Sub to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement or the breach of
any of the representations or warranties contained in ARTICLE IV results in or
causes such Order or other action; (ii) the Company, if the failure by the
Company, any Effective Time Holder or any Acquired Company to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement or the breach of any of the representations or
warranties contained in ARTICLE III results in or causes such Order or other
action; or (iii) any Party that brings or initiates a Proceeding that causes
such Order or other action;

 



 

(e) by either Buyer or the Company, by written notice to the other, if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before January 6, 2020 (the " _Outside
Date_ "); _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 8.1(e)_ shall not be available to (i) Buyer, if the failure of Buyer
or Merger Sub to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been
the cause of the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date or
(ii) the Company, if the failure by any Effective Time Holder or any Acquired
Company to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the
cause of the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date;

 



 

(f) by written notice from Buyer to the Company if any required Consent is
issued contingent upon, or Buyer becomes aware that such Consent will be
issued contingent upon, Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any Acquired Company
taking any action that would require the consent of Buyer pursuant to _Section
5.4(d)_; or

 



 

(g) by written notice from Buyer to the Company if (i) the Shareholder Written
Consent is not delivered to Buyer on or before 11:59 p.m. Central Time on the
day following the date hereof or (ii) at any time after delivery of the
Shareholder Written Consent, the Shareholder Written Consent is revoked,
amended or modified.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Buyer or the Company as provided in _Section 8.1_, this
Agreement will be void (except for the provisions set forth in _Section 5.6_,
this _Section 8.2_ and ARTICLE IX, which shall remain in full force and
effect) and there will be no Liability hereunder on the part of any Party,
except that nothing herein will relieve any Party from any Liability resulting
or arising from any material breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination and the terminating Partys right to pursue all legal remedies in
such case will survive such termination.

 



     

 

 



 

ARTICLE IX _ 
MISCELLANEOUS_

 



 

Section 9.1 _Representative_.

 



 

(a) _Appointment_. By voting in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, the
approval of the principal terms of the Merger, and the consummation of the
Merger or participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof,
including the right to receive the consideration payable in connection with
the Merger, each Effective Time Holder shall be deemed to have approved the
designation of, and hereby designates, Shareholder Representative Services LLC
as the Representative for all purposes in connection with this Agreement and
the agreements ancillary hereto. Each Effective Time Holder hereby irrevocably
appoints Representative as the agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for such
Effective Time Holder for all purposes of this Agreement (including the full
power and authority to act on such Effective Time Holders behalf for all
purposes under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents, including the
authority (a) to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, including to
execute, deliver and perform the Escrow Agreement, (b) to direct the
disbursement of any funds or stock received hereunder to each Effective Time
Holder, (c) to endorse and deliver any certificates or instruments of
assignment as Buyer shall reasonably request, (d) to execute and deliver on
behalf of such Effective Time Holder any amendment, waiver, ancillary
agreement and documents on behalf of any Effective Time Holder that
Representative deems necessary or appropriate, (e) to take all other actions
to be taken by or on behalf of such Effective Time Holder in connection
herewith or therewith, including under the Escrow Agreement, (f) to negotiate,
settle, compromise and otherwise handle any dispute or claims made by Buyer
Indemnified Parties under this Agreement, including adjustments to the Initial
Merger Consideration and all claims for indemnification made by any Buyer
Indemnified Party, (g) to refrain from enforcing any right of the Effective
Time Holders arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this
Agreement or any Transaction Document, (h) to engage special counsel,
accountants and other advisors and incur such other expenses on behalf of the
Effective Time Holders in connection with any manner arising under this
Agreement or any Transaction Document, (i) to give and receive notices under
this Agreement or any Transaction Document, (j) to waive any condition or
provision of this Agreement or any Transaction Document, and (k) to do each
and every act and exercise any and all rights and power which such Effective
Time Holders collectively are permitted or required to do or exercise under
this Agreement or such rights and power that are reasonably incidental
thereto). Each Effective Time Holder agrees that such agency and proxy are
coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable and shall survive the
death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Effective
Time Holder. All decisions and actions (including the execution of any
agreement or document) by Representative on behalf of any Effective Time
Holder (to the extent authorized by this Agreement) shall be binding upon such
Effective Time Holder, and no such Effective Time Holder shall have the right
to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. Each Effective Time
Holder agrees that Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any action taken by
Representative, on behalf of such Effective Time Holder, pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(a)_, and that each such action shall be binding on each
Effective Time Holder as fully as if such Effective Time Holder had taken such
action. The Buyer Indemnified Parties are hereby relieved from any Liability
to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of Representative.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) _No Liability; Expenses_.

 



 

(i) All acts of Representative hereunder in its capacity as such shall be
deemed to be acts on behalf of the Effective Time Holders and not of
Representative individually. Representative will incur no liability to the
Effective Time Holders of any kind with respect to any action or omission by
the Representative in connection with the Representatives services pursuant
to this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, except in the event of
liability directly resulting from the Representatives gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Representative shall not be liable to any Effective Time
Holder for any action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel.
Representative shall not by reason of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement
have a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Effective Time Holder. Any
expenses or taxable income incurred by Representative in connection with the
performance of its duties under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any
agreements ancillary hereto shall not be the personal obligation of
Representative but shall be payable by and attributable to the Effective Time
Holders based on each such Persons Pro Rata Share. The Effective Time Holders
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Representative, severally and not
jointly, based on such Persons Pro Rata Share, from and against any and all
losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions,
fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and
experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and
shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in
connection with the Representatives execution and performance of this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such
Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that
any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly
caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Representative,
the Representative will reimburse the Effective Time Holders the amount of
such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Representative
by the Effective Time Holders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered
by the Representative from (i) the funds in the Representative Reserve, (ii)
the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the General Escrow Amount at such time as
remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Effective Time
Holders, and (iii) from the Earn-Out at such time as any such amounts would
otherwise be distributable to the Effective Time Holders; provided, that while
this section allows the Representative to be paid from the aforementioned
sources of funds, this does not relieve the Effective Time Holders from their
obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or
incurred, nor does it prevent the Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Representative be
required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Effective Time Holders or
otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of, or
provisions limiting the recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable to,
the Effective Time Holders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not
intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Representative
under this section. The foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the
resignation or removal of the Representative or the termination of this
Agreement.

 



 

(ii) Buyer shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying,
upon any statements furnished to it by, and the actions of, or the failure to
act by, Representative. Buyer shall not be liable to any Effective Time Holder
for Losses sustained by any such Person, arising out of or related to the
performance of, or failure to perform by, Representative of its obligations
set forth in this Agreement, as applicable, nor shall the actions of, or the
failure to act

 



     

 

 



 

by, Representative be used as a defense by an Effective Time Holder against
any claim for Losses pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Representative Reserve_. At the Closing, Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation will deposit into an account designated by Representative,
$200,000 (the " _Representative Reserve_ "). The Representative Reserve may be
applied as Representative, in its sole discretion, determines to be
appropriate to defray, offset, or pay any third party charges, fees, costs,
Liabilities or expenses that Representative incurred in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions, including in connection with the evaluation or
defense of any claim for indemnification under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement and Representatives portion of the fees payable to the Dispute Firm
pursuant to _Section 1.8(b)_, _Section 1.17(d)_ or _Section 6.1(e)_, if
any. The Effective Time Holders will not receive any interest or earnings on
the Representative Reserve and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any
such interest or earnings. The Representative will not be liable for any loss
of principal of the Representative Reserve other than as a result of its gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Representative will hold these funds
separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating
expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these
funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. Following the
termination of the escrow accounts under the Escrow Agreement, the balance of
the Representative Reserve held pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)_, if any,
less any reserve established by Representative in connection with pending
claims under the Escrow Agreement, shall be distributed to the Effective Time
Holders as part of and on the same terms and conditions as the distribution of
any remaining General Escrow Amount under the Escrow Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the final distribution of the General
Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, Representative,
when Representative determines, in its sole discretion, that such distribution
is appropriate, shall deliver any remaining balance of the Representative
Reserve to the Paying Agent for further distribution to the Effective Time
Holders. For tax purposes, the Representative Reserve will be treated as
having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Effective Time Holders
at the time of Closing.

 



 

(d) _Confidentiality_. Representative shall treat confidentially and shall not
disclose, except in connection with enforcing its rights under this Agreement
and any Transaction Document, any nonpublic information provided by or on
behalf of Buyer or any of its Affiliates or concerning any indemnification
claim to anyone, except (i) if required by law and (ii) to Representatives
employees, advisors, agents or consultants and to the Effective Time Holders,
in each case, who have a need-to-know such information, provided that such
persons are subject to confidentiality obligations with respect hereto.

 



 

(e) _Survival; Successors_. All of the indemnities, immunities and powers
granted to Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Effective
Time or any termination of this Agreement. The provisions of this _Section
9.1_ shall be binding upon the heirs, legal representatives, successors and
assigns of each Effective Time Holder, and any references in this Agreement to
an Effective Time Holder shall mean and include the successors to the rights
of the Effective Time Holders hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary
disposition, the Laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

 



 

(f) _Removal_. The Representative may be removed by the Effective Time Holders
at any time. The Representative may resign upon 20 days notice in the event
of

 



      

 

 



 

circumstances rendering it impracticable for the Representative to continue to
effectively serve as Representative. If the Representative resigns or is
removed by the Effective Time Holders, the Effective Time Holders shall,
within ten days after such removal, appoint a successor to the Representative.
Any such successor shall succeed the former Representative as the
Representative hereunder.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Press Release_. Other than as set forth in this _Section 9.2_,
prior to the Closing, none of the parties hereto nor any of their respective
representatives shall issue any press releases or make any public
announcements with respect to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transaction
without the prior written consent of Buyer and the Company (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In connection
with the execution of this Agreement and at the Closing, the parties hereto
(other than the Representative) will issue a press release regarding this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, as applicable, in each case in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to all of the parties hereto (other
than the Representative). The timing and content of all press releases or
public announcements regarding the Contemplated Transactions will be mutually
agreed upon in advance by the parties hereto (other than the Representative).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such press release or public announcement
may be made if required by applicable Law or a securities exchange rule;
_provided_ that the party required to make such press release or public
announcement shall, to the extent possible, confer with Buyer and the Company
concerning the timing and content of such press release or public announcement
before the same is made.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
in this Agreement, each Party shall be liable for and pay all of its own costs
and expenses (including attorneys, accountants and investment bankers fees
and other out-of-pocket expenses) in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement, the performance of such Partys obligations
hereunder and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. All transfer,
property, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes,
and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other similar fees and charges
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this
Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") and expenses incurred with the
filing thereof shall be the responsibility of the Effective Time Holders. The
Person required to do so under applicable Law shall file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and,
if required by applicable Law, Buyer shall join in the execution of any such
Tax Returns and other documentation.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Books and Records_. Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable
Law or Contract, or as would be reasonably expected to violate the attorney-
client or other legal privilege of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, from and
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies
to, provide Representative and its authorized representatives with reasonable
access (for the purpose of examining and, at the Effective Time Holders cost
and expense, copying), during normal business hours, to the books and records
of the Acquired Companies with respect to periods or occurrences prior to or
on the Closing Date in connection with any Tax or administrative matter
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions;
provided that Buyer shall not be required to maintain or preserve any such
books and records other than in accordance with its general document retention
policies and procedures.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 9.5 _Amendment and Waiver_. No amendment or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and (a) if
prior to Closing, signed by Buyer and the Company, and, only to the extent
affecting the Representative, the Representative, or (b) if after the Closing,
signed by Buyer and Representative (on behalf of the Effective Time Holders).
No waiver by any Party of any default, breach of representation or warranty or
breach of covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to
extend to any other, prior or subsequent default or breach or affect in any
way any rights arising by virtue of any other, prior or subsequent default or
breach. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this
_Section 9.5_, _Section 9.7_, _Section 9.12_, _Section 9.14_ and _Section
9.16_ (and any related definitions used in such sections) may not be amended,
modified or supplemented in a manner that is adverse in any respect to any
Financing Source without the prior written consent of such Financing Source.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Notices_. All notices, demands and other communications to be
given or delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when personally
delivered, sent by fax or by email (with hard copy to follow) (b) one Business
Day after sent by reputable overnight express courier for guaranteed overnight
delivery (charges prepaid), or (c) three Business Days following mailing by
certified or registered mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested.

Section 9.7 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by any Party (including by operation of law) without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, _provided_ that Buyer and Merger
Sub

 



     

 

 



 

may, without the consent of any Person, assign in whole or in part their
rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement to (a) any of their
Affiliates or in connection with a sale of the Equity Interests or all or
substantially all of the assets of an Acquired Company or (b) the Financing
Sources as collateral security for their respective obligations related to the
Financing, but, in each case, any such assignment shall not relieve Buyer or
Merger Sub of their respective obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held
to be prohibited by or invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law
in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or
the remaining provisions of this Agreement. Furthermore, in lieu of such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added
automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision as may be possible.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Interpretation_. The headings and captions used in this Agreement
and the table of contents to this Agreement are for reference purposes only
and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit attached
hereto and not otherwise defined therein shall have the meanings set forth in
this Agreement. The use of the word "including" herein shall mean "including
without limitation." Words defined in the singular have the parallel meaning
in the plural and vice versa. References to "written" or "in writing" include
in electronic form. A dollar figure ($) means United States Dollars. The word
"or" is not exclusive. Buyer, the Acquired Companies, Representative and the
Effective Time Holders and their respective counsel have reviewed, negotiated
and adopted this Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding of the
Parties, and the language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the
language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of
strict construction shall be applied against any Person.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Transaction Documents
(including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and thereto), and the agreements
and documents referred to herein and therein and, solely as between the
Effective Time Holders and Representative, the Shareholder Representative
Services LLC engagement letter, contain the entire agreement and understanding
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to such
subject matter in any way.

 



 

Section 9.11 _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement, the
Transaction Documents, and agreements, certificates, instruments and documents
entered into in connection herewith and therewith may be executed and
delivered in one or more counterparts, including delivery of signature pages
by pdf or other electronic format, each of which shall be deemed an original
and all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement. No Party
shall raise the delivery of signature pages by use of an electronic format or
the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of an

 



     

 

 



 

electronic format as a defense to the formation or enforceability of a
contract and each Party forever waives any such defense.

 



 

Section 9.12 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Jurisdiction_. The Law of
the state of Delaware shall govern (a) all claims or matters related to or
arising from this Agreement (including any tort or non-contractual claims) and
(b) any questions concerning the construction, interpretation, validity and
enforceability of this Agreement, and the performance of the obligations
imposed by this Agreement, in each case without giving effect to any choice-
of-law or conflict-of-law rules or provisions (whether of the state of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Law of any jurisdiction other than the state of Delaware. Each of the Parties
submits to the jurisdiction of first, the Court of Chancery within New Castle
County in the State of Delaware (and any appellate court thereof located
within such county) and to the extent such Court of Chancery (or appellate
court thereof located within such county) lacks jurisdiction over the matter,
the Federal courts of the United States of America located within New Castle
County in the State of Delaware (or appellate court thereof located within
such county) in any action or Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of the action or Proceeding
shall be heard and determined in any such court. Each Party also agrees not to
bring any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other
court. Solely in connection with claims arising under this Agreement or
related to the Contemplated Transactions, each Party (i) irrevocably submits
to the jurisdiction of the chosen courts (and appropriate appellate courts
therefrom), (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or
Proceeding in the chosen courts, whether on grounds of forum non-conveniens or
otherwise, (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, waives any objection
that the chosen courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction
over any Party, and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such Party in any
such action or Proceeding will be effective if given in accordance with
_Section 9.6_, or U.S. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d), or a
corresponding state rule of civil procedure, as applicable, and further agrees
to execute a waiver of service as contemplated by such rule(s). Nothing in
this _Section 9.12_, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by law or at equity. Each Party
agrees that a final, non-appealable judgment in any Proceeding so brought
shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by law or at equity. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING
THE FINANCING) IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING THE FINANCING). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE, SHE OR IT (I) UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (II) MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (III) HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.12_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, each of the parties hereto agrees that it
will not, and will not permit any of its respective Affiliates to, bring or
support any action or Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions (whether based on contract, equity, tort or any
other theory), against the Financing Sources (including any dispute arising
out of or relating to the Financing or

 



     

 

 



 

the performance thereof) in any forum other than the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York or the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, New York County, located in the borough of Manhattan or, in
either case, any appellate court from any thereof.

 



 

Section 9.13 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that
the other Parties may be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement or any Transaction Document are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly,
each Party agrees that the other Parties shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this
Agreement or any Transaction Document and to seek to enforce specifically this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents and the terms and provisions hereof
and thereof in any action instituted in any court of the United States or any
state thereof having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter (subject to
the provisions set forth in _Section 9.12_), in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

Section 9.14 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the Parties and their permitted assigns and nothing herein
expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give any Person, other than
the Parties and such permitted assigns, any legal or equitable rights
hereunder (other than in respect of Buyer Indemnified Parties who are express
third-party beneficiaries hereunder and entitled to enforce the obligations of
Representative, Acquired Companies and Effective Time Holders hereunder).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Financing Sources are intended third-party
beneficiaries of _Section 9.5_, _Section 9.7_, _Section 9.12_, this
_Section 9.14_ and _Section 9.16_.

 



 

Section 9.15 _Schedules_. All schedules attached hereto or referred to herein
(the " _Schedules_ ") and the recitals to this Agreement are each hereby
incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full
herein. The information disclosed in any numbered part of the Schedules shall
be deemed to relate to and to qualify only the particular representation or
warranty set forth in the corresponding numbered section in the Agreement and
any other section of the Schedules to the extent the applicability of such
disclosure to such other representation and warranty is reasonably apparent on
its face (without examining any underlying or referenced documents).

 



 

Section 9.16 _Non-Recourse_. The Company and each Effective Time Holder
agrees, on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates, and each of its and
their controlling persons, shareholders, partners, members, directors,
officers, employees, advisors, agents, attorneys, trustees, administrators,
managers, representatives and successors and assigns, that they shall not
have, and they hereby waive, any rights or claims against any Financing Source
in connection with this Agreement, the Commitment Documents or any transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise, and the Company and each Effective Time Holder, on behalf of
itself and each of its Affiliates, and each of its and their controlling
persons, shareholders, partners, members, directors, officers, employees,
advisors, agents, attorneys, trustees, administrators, managers,
representatives and successors and assigns, agrees not to commence (and if
commenced agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate) any claim, action, suit,
litigation, or other proceeding (including any civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or appellate proceeding) against any Financing
Source in connection with this Agreement, the Commitment Documents or any
transaction contemplated hereby or thereby (including any claim, action, suit,
litigation, or other proceeding (including any civil, criminal,

 



     

 

 



 

administrative, investigative or appellate proceeding) relating to the
Commitment Documents and the Financing). In furtherance of and not in
limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is agreed that no Financing Source
shall have any liability for any claims, losses, settlements, liabilities,
damages, costs, expenses, fines or penalties to the Company or any Effective
Time Holder (or, in each case, any of their respective Affiliates or any of
their respective controlling persons, shareholders, partners, members,
directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents, attorneys, trustees,
administrators, managers, representatives and successors and assigns) in
connection with this Agreement, the Commitment Documents or any transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby (including any claim, action, suit, litigation,
or other proceeding (including any civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative or appellate proceeding) relating to the Commitment Documents or
the Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, no Financing Source shall be
subject to any special, consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages
of a tortious nature to the Company or any Effective Time Holder (or, in each
case, any of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective
controlling persons, shareholders, partners, members, directors, officers,
employees, advisors, agents, attorneys, trustees, administrators, managers,
representatives and successors and assigns).

 



 

Section 9.17 _Conflict Waiver_. Notwithstanding that the Company has been
represented by OlenderFeldman LLP (the " _Firm_ ") in the preparation,
negotiation and execution of this Agreement, the Company agrees that after the
Closing the Firm may represent Representative, the Effective Time Holders or
their affiliates in matters arising out of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including in respect of any indemnification claims
pursuant hereto. The Company hereby acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its
affiliates, that it has had an opportunity to ask for and has obtained
information relevant to such representation, including disclosure of the
reasonably foreseeable adverse consequences of such representation, and it
hereby waives (to the fullest extent allowed under the relevant Rules of
Professional Conduct) any conflict arising out of such future representation.

 



 

ARTICLE X _ 
CERTAIN DEFINITIONS_

 



 

Section 10.1 _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement,
capitalized terms used in this Agreement but not otherwise defined herein
