meeting of stockholders and elects to vote, except that when such proxy is coupled with an interest and the fact of the interest appears on the face of the proxy, the agent named in the proxy shall have all voting and other rights referred to in the

fees) incurred by a Covered Person in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition, such advances to be paid by the corporation within sixty (60)&nbsp;days after the receipt by the corporation of a statement or statements from
the claimant requesting such advance or advances from time to time (and subject to filing a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section&nbsp;2 of this Article V); provided, however, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or
officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made
only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered Person to repay all amounts advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right of appeal that the Covered Person is not
entitled to be indemnified by the corporation for such expenses under this Article V or otherwise. The rights conferred upon Covered Persons in this Article V shall be contract rights that vest at the time of such person&#146;s service to or at the
request of the corporation and such rights shall continue as to a Covered Person who has ceased to be a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee&#146;s heirs, executors and administrators. </P>

therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the claimant is entitled to indemnification. Upon written request by a claimant
for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of this Section&nbsp;2 of Article V, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to the claimant&#146;s entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (a)&nbsp;if requested by the
claimant, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined), or (b)&nbsp;if no request is made by the claimant for a determination by Independent Counsel, (1)&nbsp;by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Disinterested
Directors (as hereinafter defined), or (2)&nbsp;if a quorum of the board of directors consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, such quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by Independent Counsel in a
written opinion to the board of directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the claimant, or (3)&nbsp;if a quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by the stockholders of the corporation. In the event the determination of entitlement to
indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel at the request of the claimant, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the board of directors unless there shall have occurred within two (2)&nbsp;years prior to the date of the commencement
of the action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a change of control of the corporation is consummated, in which case the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the claimant unless the claimant shall request that such
selection be made by the board of directors. If it is so determined that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the claimant shall be made within sixty (60)&nbsp;days after such determination. </P>

if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in
advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct which makes it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the
corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) to have
made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of

request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any amount such person has collected as indemnification from
such other corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, nonprofit entity, or other enterprise; and, in the event the corporation has fully paid such expenses, the Covered Person shall return to the corporation any

whether because of death, resignation or otherwise before such certificate or certificates have been delivered by the corporation, such certificate or certificates may nevertheless be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who signed
such certificate or certificates or whose facsimile signature or signatures have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer or officers of the corporation. All certificates for shares shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise identified.
The name of the person to whom the shares represented thereby are issued, with the number of shares and date of issue, shall be entered on the books of the corporation. Shares of stock of the corporation shall only be transferred on the books of the

evidence of the authenticity of such endorsement, transfer, authorization, and other matters as the corporation may reasonably require, and accompanied by all necessary stock transfer stamps. In that event, it shall be the duty of the corporation to
issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate or certificates, and record the transaction on its books. The board of directors may appoint a bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United States or
