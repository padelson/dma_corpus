Agreement

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I.

 

THE OFFER

 

1.1 The Offer.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Section 7.1_, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten
(10) days) after the date hereof, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all of the Shares at a price per share
equal to the Offer Price.

 

(b) The obligation of Purchaser to, and of Parent to cause Purchaser to,
accept for payment and pay for any Shares validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction, or
waiver by Purchaser or Parent, of the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ (the "
_Offer Conditions_ "). Subject to the satisfaction, or waiver by Purchaser or
Parent, of the Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for
payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within three (3) Business Days) after the Expiration Date and in any event in
compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (the time of such
acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Time_ "). The Offer Price payable
in respect of each Share validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant
to the Offer shall be paid net to the seller of such Share in cash, without
interest, subject to the deduction or withholding of any Taxes as
contemplated in _Section 2.9_, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement. The time scheduled for payment for shares of Company
Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to and subject to the conditions
of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ ", and
the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as
the " _Offer Closing Date_ _._ "

 



2 (c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase that describes
the terms and conditions of the Offer as set forth in this Agreement.
Purchaser and Parent expressly reserve the right to waive (in whole or in
part) any Offer Condition at any time and from time to time, to increase the
Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the
Offer; __provided__ , __however__ , that without the prior written consent of
the Company, Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the
form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the number of Shares
to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend or modify any of the Offer Conditions
in a manner that is adverse to the holders of Shares or impose conditions to
the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (v) amend, modify or waive the
Minimum Condition, or (vi) extend or otherwise change any time period for the
performance of any obligation of Purchaser or Parent (including the Expiration
Date) in a manner other than pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement.

(d) Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall initially
be scheduled to expire at midnight, New York City time, on the date that is
twenty (20) Business Days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and
Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) after the commencement of the Offer
(such initial expiration date of the Offer or such subsequent date to which
the expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the parties respective
termination rights under _Article VII_ : (i) if, as of the then-scheduled
Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived,
Purchaser may, in its sole discretion (and without the consent of the Company
or any other Person), extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for an
additional period of up to ten (10) Business Days per extension, to permit
such Offer Condition to be satisfied; (ii) Purchaser shall have the right in
its sole discretion to extend the Offer beyond any then-scheduled Expiration
Date for one or more consecutive increments of up to five (5) Business Days
each, the length of each such period to be determined by Parent in its sole
discretion (or such longer period as Parent and the Company may mutually
agree) if (A) Parent and Purchaser shall have waived the Financing Proceeds
Condition, (B) all of the Offer Conditions other than the Financing Proceeds
Condition have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Expiration Date, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) and (C) the Debt Financing (or any
alternative financing contemplated by _Section 5.13_) has not actually been
received by Purchaser or Parent; (iii) if (A) the Financing Proceeds Condition
has been satisfied or waived less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
then-scheduled Expiration Date and (B) all of the other Offer Conditions have
been satisfied or waived at the then-scheduled Expiration Date, then Purchaser
and Parent shall have a one-time right to extend the Offer for a period of up
to five (5) Business Days, and (iv) if, as of the then-scheduled Expiration
Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, at the
request of the Company, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
extend the Offer on one or more occasions for an additional period of up to
ten (10) Business Days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be
satisfied or waived. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
1.1(d)_, in no event shall Purchaser: (1) be required to accept for payment,
and pay for, Shares validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer
until the Marketing Period shall have been completed; (2) be required to
extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date; or (3) be permitted to extend the
Offer beyond the earliest to occur of the valid termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 7.1_ and the Outside Date without the prior
written consent of the Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary,

 



3  Purchaser shall, without the written consent of the Company, extend the
Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC or its staff, any rule or regulation of the NYSE, or any
other applicable Law, in each case, applicable to the Offer.

(e) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except for a
termination of this Agreement permitted in accordance with the terms of
_Section 7.1_. In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.1_, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of such termination),
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer, not acquire any Shares
pursuant thereto, and cause any depositary acting on its behalf to promptly
return in accordance with applicable Law all tendered Shares to the registered
holders thereof.

 

(f) If the Acceptance Time occurs, but there has been a 251(h) Inapplicable
Determination, and the number of Shares that have been validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn in the Offer, together with any Shares then owned by
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent (assuming exercise of the Top-Up Option in
full and excluding from such ownership Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed
delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or
satisfaction of such guarantee), is less than 90% of the outstanding Shares,
Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, commence a "subsequent offering period"
in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act (a " _Subsequent
Offering Period_ ") and one or more extensions thereof. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to) immediately accept for payment, and pay for, all
Shares that are validly tendered pursuant to the offer during such Subsequent
Offering Period.

 

(g) On the commencement date of the Offer, Purchaser and Parent shall (i) file
or cause to be filed with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 under the
Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ ") that will contain or incorporate by reference the related
offer to purchase the Shares pursuant to the Offer, the form of the related
letter of transmittal, the summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer
documents pursuant to which the Offer will be made and instruments
pursuant to which the Offer will be made (collectively, and together with all
exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "); and
(ii) cause the Schedule TO and related Offer Documents to be disseminated
to holders of Shares in accordance with applicable federal securities Laws.
The Company shall promptly furnish to Purchaser and Parent in writing all
information concerning the Company and its stockholders that may be required
by applicable Law to be set forth in the Offer Documents or reasonably
requested in connection with any action contemplated by this _Section
1.1(g)_. The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with
the SEC, and Purchaser and Parent shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel. Each of
Purchaser, Parent and the Company agrees to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or
as otherwise required by applicable Law. Purchaser and Parent further agree to
take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected (if
applicable) to be filed with the SEC and

 



4  disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities Laws. Upon receipt of any written or
oral comments by Purchaser, Parent or their counsel from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents, or any request from the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Offer Documents, Purchaser and Parent
agree to (i) promptly provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any
such written comments or requests (or a description of any such oral comments
or requests); (ii) provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to comment on any proposed response thereto, and to give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments made by the
Company and its counsel; (iii) provide the Company and its counsel an
opportunity to participate with Purchaser, Parent or their counsel in any
material discussions or meetings with the SEC or its staff; and (iv) provide
the Company with copies of any written comments or responses submitted by
Purchaser and Parent in response thereto.

 

(h) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, merger,
issuer tender offer, exchange of shares or other like change with respect
to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to
Purchasers acceptance for payment of, and payment for, Company Common Stock
tendered in the Offer, and such adjustment to the Offer Price shall provide to
the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such action and shall as so adjusted from and after
the date of such event, be the Offer Price; __provided_ , _however__ , that no
such adjustment shall be made to reflect the issuance of additional shares of
capital stock of the Company as a result of Purchasers exercise of the Top-Up
Option or as a result of Parents and Purchasers acquisition of Company
Common Stock tendered in the Offer; and __provided__ , __further__ , that
nothing in this _Section 1.1(h)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to
take any action with respect to the Company Common Stock that is prohibited by
the terms of this Agreement.

(i) Subject in all respects to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Offer Conditions, Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any
shares of Company Common Stock that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer.

 

1.2 Company Actions.

 

(a) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall
file or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender
Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to
the Offer (together with all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto, the
" _Schedule 14D-9_") that, subject to _Section 5.4(d)_(i) and  _Section
5.4(d)(ii)_, shall contain and reflect the Company Board Recommendation. The
Company shall also include in the Schedule 14D-9 the opinion of the Company
Financial Advisor. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of
the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents and to the inclusion
of a copy of the Schedule 14D-9 with the Offer Documents mailed or furnished
to holders of Shares. Each of Purchaser and Parent shall promptly furnish to
the Company in writing all information concerning Purchaser and Parent that
may be required by applicable Law to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 or
reasonably requested in connection with

 



5  any actions contemplated by this _Section 1.2(a)_. The Company shall cause
the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC pursuant to this _Section 1.2(a)_
to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act concurrently with the dissemination of the
Schedule TO to the holders of Company Common Stock by Purchaser. Except with
respect to any amendments filed in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or
after a Change in Company Board Recommendation, the Company agrees to provide
Purchaser, Parent and their counsel reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and
the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by Purchaser, Parent and their counsel. Each of the Company, Purchaser
and Parent agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for use
in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect. The Company further agrees
to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to
be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable Law. Upon receipt of any
written or oral comments or requests for amendments or supplements by the
Company or its counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9, the Company agrees to (i) promptly provide Purchaser, Parent and their
counsel with a copy of any such written comments or requests for amendments or
supplements (or a description of any such oral comments); (ii) provide
Purchaser, Parent and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to comment on any
proposed response thereto, and to give reasonable and good faith consideration
to any such comments made by Purchaser, Parent and their counsel prior to
responding to any such comments or requests; and (iii) provide Purchaser or
Parent with copies of any written comments or responses submitted by the
Company in response thereto.

 

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent
to promptly furnish Purchaser and Parent with (i) mailing labels containing
the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares; and (ii) security
position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a recent
date, and of those persons who become record or beneficial owners subsequent
to such date, together with other readily available listings and computer
files containing names, addresses and security position listings of record
holders and non-objecting beneficial owners of Shares. The Company shall
furnish Purchaser and Parent with such additional information, including
updated listings and computer files of record holders and beneficial holders
of Shares, mailing labels, addresses, and security position listings, and such
other assistance as Purchaser, Parent or their agents may reasonably require
in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares.
Subject to applicable Law, and except for such actions as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents, Purchaser and Parent shall hold in
confidence the information and documents provided to them under this _Section
1.2(b)_, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the
Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request,
deliver to the Company or destroy (and confirm such destruction in writing)
all such information and documents (along with all copies thereof) then in
their possession or control.

 

1.3 Directors of the Company.

 

(a) Effective as of the Acceptance Time and from time to time thereafter,
Parent shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors (rounded
up to the next whole number) on the Company Board equal to the product of (i)
the total number of directors on the

 



6  Company Board (giving effect to the election of any additional directors
pursuant to this _Section 1.3(a)_); and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of Shares owned by Purchaser and Parent (giving effect to
Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer), and the denominator of
which is the total number of then outstanding Shares. In furtherance thereof,
the Company and the Company Board shall, after the purchase of and payment
for Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer, upon request of Purchaser,
promptly increase the size of the Company Board or use reasonable best efforts
to secure the resignations of such number of directors as is necessary to
enable Parents designees to be so elected to the Company Board, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause Parents designees to be so elected. In
addition, subject to applicable Law, the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the individuals so designated by Parent to constitute
substantially the same percentage (rounding up where appropriate) of each
committee of the Company Board as the percentage represented by such
individuals on the Company Board as a whole.

(b) The Companys obligations under _Section 1.3(a)_ to appoint Parents
designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly
file with the SEC and mail to the holders of Shares the information required
by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder.
Purchaser and Parent will supply the Company with, and will be solely
responsible for, any information with respect to them and their nominees,
officers, directors and Affiliates required by such Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1, and the Companys obligations under _Section 1.3(a)_ and this _Section
1.3(b)_ shall be conditioned upon receipt of such information.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 1.3_,
Purchaser, Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause the Company Board to include, at all times prior to the
Effective Time, at least three (3) of the members of the Company Board,
selected by members of the Company Board, who (x) were directors of the
Company immediately prior to the Acceptance Time (y) are not officers of the
Company and (z) are independent directors for purposes of the continuing
listing requirements of the NYSE (the " _Continuing Directors_ ");
__provided__ , _ _however__ , that if at any time prior to the Acceptance Time
there shall be fewer than three (3) Continuing Directors on the Company Board
for any reason, the Company Board shall cause the person(s) designated by the
remaining Continuing Director(s) to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to
be a Continuing Director for all purposes of this Agreement, or if no
Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors of the Company then in
office shall designate three (3) persons to fill such vacancies who are not
directors, officers, employees, stockholders, designees or Affiliates of
Purchaser or Parent and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing
Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. Following the election or
appointment of Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section
1.3(a)_ and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of
the Continuing Directors (or the approval of the sole Continuing Director if
there shall be only one (1) Continuing Director) shall be required to
authorize: (i) any amendment or modification to, or termination of, or any
agreement to amend, modify or terminate, this Agreement by or on behalf of
the Company; (ii) any extension or waiver by the Company of the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Purchaser or Parent
under this Agreement; (iii) any exercise or waiver of any of the Companys
rights or remedies hereunder; (iv) any amendment to the Companys Charter
Documents; (v) any authorization of any agreement between the 

 



7  Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Purchaser,
Parent or any of their Affiliates on the other hand; (vi) the taking of any
other action by the Company in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby required to be taken by the Company Board as
contemplated by this Agreement; or (vii) any other action not contemplated by
this Agreement that would or would be reasonably likely to adversely affect
the rights of the Companys stockholders hereunder. Following the election or
appointment of Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section
1.3(a)_ and until the Effective Time, any action by the Company with respect
to the enforcement of this Agreement by the Company shall be effected only by
and at the direction of a majority of the Continuing Directors (or the action
of the sole Continuing Director if there shall only be one (1) Continuing
Director then in office), and any such authorization or direction shall
constitute the authorization and direction of the full Company Board with
respect thereto, and no other action on the part of the Company, including
any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to
authorize, or for the Company to take, any such action. The Continuing
Directors shall have the authority to retain such counsel and other advisors
at the expense of the Company as reasonably determined by the Continuing
Directors and any such reasonable expenses shall be paid by the Company
promptly upon written request by the Continuing Directors.

 

1.4 Top-Up Option.

 

(a) Prior to the scheduled Acceptance Time, Parent and the Company shall
confer and mutually determine, in good faith, after consulting with their
respective outside legal counsel, whether the Merger remains eligible to be
effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL. Unless Parent and the Company
determine that the Merger is ineligible to be effected pursuant to Section
251(h) of the DGCL (the " _251(h) Inapplicable Determination_ ") the Merger
shall be effected in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL. If prior to
the Effective Time, Parent and the Company make a 251(h) Inapplicable
Determination then, contingent and effective upon the occurrence of the 251(h)
Inapplicable Determination and the Acceptance Time, the Company hereby grants
to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable
only once and only upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this _Section 1.4_, and only for so long as this Agreement has not been
terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_, to purchase at a price per share equal
to the Offer Price an aggregate number of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ")
equal to up to the number of then-available authorized and unissued shares of
Company Common Stock; __provided__ , __however__ , that the Top-Up Option
shall not be deemed to be exercised (i) to purchase an amount of Top-Up Option
Shares in excess of the number of shares of Company Common Stock authorized
and unissued (treating shares owned by the Company as treasury stock as
unissued) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option (treating shares of
Company Common Stock that the Company may be required to issue upon the
vesting (including vesting solely as a result of the consummation of the
Offer), conversion, settlement or exercise of all then outstanding warrants,
options, benefit plans, obligations or securities convertible or exchangeable
into shares of Company Common Stock, or other rights to acquire or be issued
shares of Company Common Stock, regardless of the conversion or exercise price
or other terms and conditions thereof, as if such shares were
outstanding), (ii) unless immediately after such exercise and the issuance of
the Top-Up Option Shares, Purchaser and Parent shall, when added to the shares
of Company Common Stock owned by Purchaser and Parent, own at least 90% of the
shares of the Company Common Stock outstanding (excluding from the
calculation of the

 



8  number of shares of Company Common Stock Purchaser and Parent then owns, but
not from the calculation of then-outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
the Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not
yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee)
immediately after the Acceptance Time (the " _Short-Form Threshold_ "), (iii)
unless the Acceptance Time shall have occurred, (iv) unless Purchaser
irrevocably commits upon acquisition of the Top-Up Shares to immediately
effect the Merger pursuant to _Section 2.3_ and (v) if the exercise of the
Top-Up Option, the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares and
compliance with this _Section 1.4_ shall be prohibited by any outstanding
order or Law (excluding any rules of the NYSE that require stockholder
approval). Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate purchase price
required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares as set forth in _Section
1.4(b)_.

(b) In the event there is a 251(h) Inapplicable Determination, and subject to
the limitations set forth in _Section 1.4(a)_ and the satisfaction of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article VI,_ if there shall not have
been validly tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn that number of
shares of Company Common Stock which, when added to the shares of Company
Common Stock owned by Purchaser and Parent prior to giving effect to the
exercise of the Top-Up Option, does not represent at least the Short-Form
Threshold on the Offer Closing Date, Purchaser shall on such date be deemed to
have exercised the Top-Up Option for such number of Top-Up Option Shares as is
necessary for Purchaser to reach the Short-Form Threshold and on such
date shall give the Company prior written notice specifying (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Purchaser and
Parent at the time of such notice (giving effect to the Offer Closing but
prior to giving effect to the exercise of the Top-Up Option) and (y) the
number of Top-Up Option Shares. Such notice will also include an undertaking
signed by Purchaser and Parent that, immediately following the Top-Up Closing,
Purchaser will, and Parent will cause Purchaser to, consummate the Merger in
accordance with _Section 2.3_. The Company shall, as soon as practicable
following receipt of such notice (and in any event no later than the Offer
Closing), deliver written notice to Purchaser specifying the number of Shares
then outstanding and, based on such number and, based on the information
provided by Purchaser in its notice, the number of Top-Up Option Shares to be
purchased. If the number of Top-Up Option Shares specified in the notice
provided delivered by Purchaser is different than the number of Top-Up Option
Shares specified in the notice delivered by the Company, the Company and
Purchaser shall, as promptly as practicable and in any event on the Offer
Closing Date, reasonably agree on the appropriate number of Top-Up Option
Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares (the "
_Top-Up Closing_ "), which shall take place simultaneously with the Offer
Closing, the purchase price owed by Purchaser to the Company to purchase the
Top-Up Option Shares shall be paid to the Company, at Purchasers option: (i)
in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds; or (ii) by (A) paying by check or
in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds, an amount equal to not less than
the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares and (B) executing and
delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to
the aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the amount
paid in cash pursuant to the preceding clause (A) (the " _Promissory Note_ ").
The Promissory Note: (1) shall be due on the first anniversary of the Top-Up
Closing; (2) shall bear simple interest of 5% per annum, payable in arrears
at maturity; (3) shall be fully recourse to Purchaser and Parent; (4) may be
prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty; and (5)
shall have no other material terms. At the Top-Up Closing, the Company shall
cause to be issued to Purchaser a certificate representing the Top-Up Option
Shares.

 



9 (c) Each of Purchaser and Parent acknowledges that the Top-Up Option Shares
that Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. The
parties hereto shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable Laws, including
compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option
Shares under the Securities Act. Each of Purchaser and Parent represents and
warrants to the Company that Purchaser is, and will be upon the exercise of
the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. Each of Purchaser and
Parent represents, warrants and agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up
Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and
will be acquired by Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within
the meaning of the Securities Act). Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Option
Shares shall include any legends required by applicable securities Laws.

 

(d) Any dilutive impact on the value of the shares of Company Common Stock
resulting from the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares or the payment by
Purchaser to the Company of consideration of the Top-Up Option Shares,
including the Promissory Note, will not be taken into account in any
determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL as contemplated by _Section 2.10_ and none of the parties
hereto shall take any position to the contrary in any appraisal proceeding.

 

(e) Purchasers right to exercise the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this
Agreement may not be assigned other than in accordance with _Section 8.8_
without the prior written consent of the Company. Any attempted assignment in
violation of this _Section 1.4(e)_ shall be null and void.

obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available). Any interest or other income resulting from the
investment of such funds shall be the property of Parent.

 

(b) Within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, the Payment Agent
will mail to the Persons who were record holders of Company Stock
Certificates or book-entry shares immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than to holders of Dissenting Shares to the extent such holders do not
also hold Shares that are not Dissenting Shares): (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form reasonably acceptable to the Company; and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates
in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate to the Payment Agent for exchange, together with a duly completed
and validly executed letter of transmittal or receipt of an "agents message"
by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer to the
Payment Agent as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of
such book-entry shares, together with a duly completed and validly executed
letter of transmittal or, in each case, such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Payment Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such
Company Stock Certificate or book-entry share shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration; and (B) the Company Stock
Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.8(b)_, each Company Stock Certificate or
book entry share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration as contemplated by 
_Section 2.5_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon
the surrender or transfer of any Certificate or book-entry share. If any
Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent or
the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
payment of any Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company
Common Stock previously represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require
the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to
provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against the Payment Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate. Upon the making of
such affidavit and delivering such bond, the Payment Agent will issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated under this
_Article II_. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates
formerly evidencing the shares of Company Common Stock is registered on the
stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the 

 



15  registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established
to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have
been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to book-entry shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such book-entry shares are registered.

 

(c) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed or undistributed to
holders of Company Stock Certificates or book-entry shares as of the date
that is one (1) year after the Merger Closing Date shall be delivered to
Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates (other than
with respect to any Dissenting Shares) who have not theretofore surrendered
their Company Stock Certificates or book-entry shares in accordance with this
_Section 2.8_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for
satisfaction of their claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this 
_Section 2.8_. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of
Company Common Stock two (2) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier
date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any Governmental Body) shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any holder of any Company Stock Certificate or to any other
Person with respect to any Merger Consideration delivered to any public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property Law, escheat Law or
similar Law.

2.9 Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, each of the Payment Agent, Purchaser, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Offer Price,
Merger Consideration or any other payments made in connection with this
Agreement, as applicable, payable to any holder of any shares of Company
Common Stock, any holder of any Company Equity Award or any other recipient
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld from such consideration under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax Law or under any other applicable Law. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

2.10 Dissenting Shares.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has made a demand for
appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (any such
shares being referred to as " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such
holder effectively withdraws or fails to perfect or otherwise loses such
holders appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such
shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.5_, but shall be entitled only
to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares. At
the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL.

 



16 (b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into
and shall represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with  _Section 2.5_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of
the Company Stock Certificate representing such shares or transfer of such
book-entry share, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

(c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt written notice of (A) any demand
for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL; (B) any withdrawal or attempted withdrawal of any such demand; and
(C) any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL; and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment or settlement offer or settle any
such demands prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand,
notice or instrument. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled
under Section 262 of the DGCL to receive payment of the "fair value" for such
holders shares shall receive such payment therefor from the Surviving
Corporation after giving effect to any withholdings or deductions required by
applicable Law (but only after the amount thereof shall have been finally
determined pursuant to the DGCL), and such shares shall be retired and
cancelled.

2.11 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Purchaser
and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in the name of the
Company and otherwise) to take and shall take such action.

the Company may vote. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a
party to any voting agreement with respect to any Company securities or
securities of any wholly-owned Company Subsidiary. None of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock are subject to any right of first refusal in
favor of the Company. The Company is not party to any Contract relating to
the voting or registration of, or restricting any Person from purchasing,
selling, pledging or otherwise disposing of (or from granting any option or
similar right with respect to), any shares of Company Common Stock other than
Contracts granting the Company the right to acquire restricted shares of
Company Common Stock held by a Company Employee upon termination of such

3.5 SEC Reports and Financial Statements.

 

(a) Since January 1, 2011, the Company has timely filed with the SEC all
forms, reports, schedules, registration statements, definitive proxy
statements and other documents (collectively, including all exhibits thereto,
the " _Company SEC Reports_ ") required to be filed by the Company with the
SEC. As of their respective filing dates, and giving effect to any amendments
or supplements thereto filed prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company
SEC Reports complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may
be, and the respective rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder
applicable to such Company SEC Reports, and none of the Company SEC Reports
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. None of the Company Subsidiaries is required to file any
forms, reports or other documents with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15
of the Exchange Act.

(b) The consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders equity (or deficit) and cash flows (including, in
each case, any related notes and schedules thereto) (collectively, the "
_Company Financial Statements_ ") of the Company contained in the Company SEC
Reports comply in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, have been prepared in conformity with GAAP (except, in the case
of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as otherwise noted
therein or to the extent required by GAAP) and present fairly in all material
respects the consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of
operations and cash flows of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of
the dates or for the periods presented therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal year-end adjustments that are not,
individually or in the aggregate, material). Except as reflected in the
Company Financial Statements or for liabilities incurred since June 30, 2013
in the ordinary course of business, neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth
on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or
in the notes thereto, which, individually or in the aggregate, has had a
Company Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is a party to or has any obligation or other commitment to become a party to
any securitization transaction, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar
Contract (including any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)) where the result, purpose or
intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary in any published financial statements or other Company SEC Reports.

 



22 (c) With respect to each annual report on Form 10-K, each quarterly report on
Form 10-Q and each amendment of any such report included in the Company SEC
Reports filed since May 24, 2011, the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive
officer and each former principal financial officer of the Company) have made
all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(d) The Company maintains, and at all times since May 24, 2011 has
maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and that
receipts and expenditures are executed in accordance with the authorizations
of management and directors of the Company; and (ii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that would materially
affect the Companys financial statements. The Companys management
has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys system of
internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as of the fiscal year ended December
31, 2012, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective and
the Companys independent registered accountant has issued (and not
subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report concluding that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2012. To the Knowledge of the Company, except as set forth in the
Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, since May 24,
2011, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries nor the Companys
independent registered accountant has identified or been made aware of: (i)
any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting utilized by the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries; or (ii) any illegal act or fraud, whether or not
material, that involves the management or other employees of any the Company
or any Company Subsidiaries.

 

(e) The Company maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably
designed to ensure that (i) all information (both financial and nonfinancial)
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported to the individuals responsible for preparing such reports within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and (ii) all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management or to
other individuals responsible for preparing such reports as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports.

(f) As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in
comment letters received from the SEC with respect to the Company SEC Reports.
To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Documents is the
subject of ongoing SEC review and there are no inquiries or investigations by
the SEC or any internal investigations pending or threatened, in each case
regarding any accounting or disclosure practices of the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries.

 

(g) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all current
listing and corporate governance requirements of the NYSE, and is in
compliance in all material respects with all rules, regulations and
requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 



23 3.6 Absence of Material Adverse Changes, etc.

 

(a) Since June 30, 2013 the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
conducted their business in all material respects in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice. Since January 1, 2013 the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries have not taken any actions which, had such actions
been taken after the date of this Agreement, would have required the written
consent of Parent pursuant to _Sections 5.2(b)(i)_ , _5.2(b)(iv)_ ,

their respective Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person, including
any information, documents, estimates, projections, forecasts or other

investigation of the Company by Purchaser and Parent and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives, Purchaser and Parent and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives have received and may continue to receive after
the date hereof from the Company and its Affiliates and Representatives
certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as certain business plan information, regarding the
Company and its business and operations. Purchaser and Parent hereby
acknowledge and agree that: (a) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting
to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
statements, as well as in 

 



38  such business plans, with which Purchaser and Parent are familiar; (b)
Purchaser and Parent are taking full responsibility for making their own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such business
plans, so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-
looking information or business plans); and (c) except in the case of Fraud
and except to the extent such information is expressly included in the
representations and warranties made by the Company and contained in this
Agreement, Purchaser and Parent hereby waive any claim against the Company or
any Company Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives with respect to any information described in this _Section
4.8_. Accordingly, Purchaser and Parent hereby acknowledge and agree that
none of the Company nor any Company Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives, has made or is making any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans) unless such
information is expressly included in the representations and warranties made
by the Company and contained in this Agreement.

4.9 Financing.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of
(i) the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, from Bank of
America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, Royal Bank
of Canada, RBC Capital Markets, Bank of Montreal and BMO Capital Markets Corp.
(together with all exhibits, annexes, schedules and attachments thereto,
including the Redacted Fee Letter, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant
to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the lenders party
thereto have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Purchaser for
the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Debt Financing_ "), and (ii) the executed equity commitment letter, dated as
of the date hereof (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the
Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Financing Commitments_ ") from certain funds
affiliated with the Sponsor pursuant to which Sponsor has caused such funds to
commit to invest the amounts set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "
and, together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). The Equity
Commitment Letter provides, and will continue to provide until such time
as this Agreement is terminated, that the Company is a third party
beneficiary thereof.

(b) Each of the Financing Commitments is, as of the date hereof, in full
force and effect and has not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any
respect or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect, and no
such withdrawal, termination, rescission, amendment, supplement
or modification is presently contemplated other than as permitted herein.
Each of the Financing Commitments is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Purchaser and Parent and (in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter only, to
the Knowledge of Purchaser and Parent) the other parties thereto. Purchaser
has delivered a true and complete copy of the Debt Commitment Letter (as
amended through the date hereof). Except for the Financing Commitments in the
form delivered pursuant to  _Section 4.9(a)_, there are no side letters or
other agreements, contracts or arrangements relating to the Financing or the
Financing Commitments, including any that could affect the availability of the
Financing, to which 

 



39  Purchaser, Parent, Sponsor or any of their respective Affiliates is a party
other than as expressly set forth or referenced in the Financing Commitments
and any customary engagement letters and non-disclosure agreements that do
not impact the conditionality for the Financing to occur or amount of the
Financing. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would (x) constitute a default or breach on
the part of Purchaser, Parent or Sponsor and (in the case of the Debt
Commitment Letter only, to the Knowledge of Purchaser and Parent) any of the
other parties thereto, under any term of the Financing Commitment, (y) result
in a failure of any condition of the Financing Commitments, or (z) result in
any portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable;
__provided__ that Parent and Purchaser are not making any representation or
warranty regarding the effect of any inaccuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Article III_ , or the Companys compliance hereunder.
Purchaser and Parent have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
or deposits required by the Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the
date hereof. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Parents
obligation to consummate the Offer and/or the Merger (as applicable), the
aggregate net proceeds of the Financing will be sufficient for the
satisfaction of all of Purchasers and Parents obligations under this
Agreement, including the payment of the Offer Price in respect of each share
of Company Common Stock validly tendered and accepted for payment in the
Offer and payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.8_, all amounts to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.6_, the payment of all
associated costs and expenses of the Offer and the Merger (including any
repayment or refinancing of Indebtedness of the Company required in connection
therewith) and the payment of all other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions and to allow Purchaser
and Parent to perform all of their obligations under this Agreement. There are
no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding or
investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing, other than as
expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments. As of the date hereof,
neither Purchaser nor Parent has any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the full amount of
the Financing will not be available to Purchaser on the date of the Closing;
__provided__ that Parent and Purchaser are not making any representation or
warranty regarding the effect of any inaccuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Article III_ , or the Companys compliance
hereunder.

(c) Neither Purchaser nor Parent is a party to any Contract which directly or
indirectly limits or restricts the ability of any Person to provide debt
financing for other potential purchasers of the Company.

4.10 Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has
delivered to the Company the Guarantee duly executed by the Sponsor with
respect to certain matters on the terms specified therein. The Guarantee is in
full force and effect and constitutes a valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of the Sponsor party thereto in favor of the Company, and no event
has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of the Sponsor under such Guarantee.

4.11 Solvency. Neither Purchaser nor Parent is entering into this Agreement
with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors of the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries. After giving effect
to the Transactions and the Financing, and the payment of the Offer Price in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered

 



40  and accepted for payment in the Offer and payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.8_, all amounts to be paid pursuant to
_Section 2.6_, the payment of all associated costs and expenses of the Offer
and the Merger (including any repayment or refinancing of Indebtedness of the
Company required in connection therewith) and the payment of all other amounts
required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions
and to allow Purchaser and Parent to perform all of their obligations under
this Agreement, and assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Purchasers
and Parents obligations to consummate the Offer, the Surviving Corporation
will be Solvent as of and after the Effective Time. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " shall mean that, as of any date of
determination and with respect to any Person: (a) the fair value of the
assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is
greater than the total amount of liabilities, including contingent
liabilities, of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated
basis, (b) the present fair saleable value of the assets of such Person and
its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is not less than the amount that
will be required to pay the probable liability of such Person and its
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, on their debts and liabilities as they
become absolute and matured, (c) such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, are not engaged in business or a transaction, and are not
about to engage in business or a transaction, for which such Persons and its
Subsidiaries assets, on a consolidated basis, would constitute unreasonably
small capital, and (d) such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated
basis, do not intend to, and do not believe that they will, incur debts or
liabilities beyond their ability to pay such debts and liabilities as they
mature; __provided__ , __however__ , for the purposes hereof, the amount of
any contingent liability at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in
light of all of the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents
the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured
liability (irrespective of whether such contingent liabilities meet the
criteria for accrual under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 5).

4.12 Ownership of Company Common Stock. None of Purchaser or Parent or any of
their "affiliates" or "associates" is, or at any time during the last three
(3) years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined
in Section 203 of the DGCL. Prior to the Agreement Date, neither Parent nor
Purchaser has taken, or authorized or permitted any Representatives of Parent
or Purchaser to take, any action that would reasonably be expected to cause,
Parent, Purchaser or any of their "affiliates" or "associates" to be deemed
an "interested stockholder" as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL or otherwise
render Section 251(h) of the DGCL inapplicable to the Merger.

(b) Subject to _Section 5.4_, if, following the Acceptance Time, the Company
Stockholder Vote is required by applicable Law to consummate the Merger, the
Company shall

 



45  (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable following such determination,
prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement in preliminary form
(collectively, as amended or supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") that
will be provided to the Companys stockholders in connection with the
solicitation of proxies for use at the meeting of the Companys stockholders
called to vote upon the Merger and other Transactions (the " _Company
Stockholders Meeting_ "), and (ii) promptly after the Proxy Statement
Clearance Date (and in any event within three (3) Business Days of clearance),
(x) establish a record date (which record date shall be as soon as reasonably
practicable) for and give notice of the Company Stockholders Meeting for the
purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement, and (y) cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as of the record date
established for the Company Stockholders Meeting (the date the company elects
to take such action or is required to take such action, the " _Proxy Date_ ").

 

(c) Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Proxy Statement prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and
the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by Parent and its counsel. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon
the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any
request from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or supplements
to the Proxy Statement, and shall provide Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on the other hand, and the Company
agrees to provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to comment
on and respond thereto, and to give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any such comments made by Parent and its counsel prior to responding to any
comments or requests of the SEC or its staff. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable and
to resolve any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect to
the Proxy Statement.

(d) The Company shall duly call, convene and hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Date (but,

has instructed the Company is necessary under applicable Law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the

that the condition in _Section 6.1(a)_ will be satisfied at such Company
Stockholders Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may require the
Company to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting one (1) time
(for a period of not more than thirty (30) calendar days but not past two (2)
Business Days prior to the Outside Date), unless prior to such adjournment the
Company shall have received an aggregate number of proxies voting for the
adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions, which have not been

such Company

 



46  Stockholders Meeting. Once the Company has established a record date for the
Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting
without the prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by
applicable Law or the Company Charter Documents. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company or Parent or
any of the Companys or Parents Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or
directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent, respectively, which,
pursuant to the Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a

any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have
become false or misleading.

and Parent required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement and shall
otherwise assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the
Proxy Statement and the resolution of comments from the SEC (or the staff of
the SEC). Except with respect to any amendments filed in connection with a
Change in Company Board Recommendation, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and to propose comments on such document or response and give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments made by Parent
and its counsel prior to responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff
of the SEC).

the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions and shall ensure that all
proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are
solicited in compliance with all applicable Laws and all rules of the NYSE. At
any Company Stockholders Meeting, Parent shall ensure that all Company Common
Stock owned beneficially or of record by Purchaser, Parent or any of Parents
other Affiliates, or any shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which
Purchaser or Parent or any of Parents other Affiliates holds a valid proxy,
will be voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the
Transactions.

5.4 No Solicitation by the Company; Other Offers.

 

(a) Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the date on which this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall not, and shall cause its and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly through another Person, except
as otherwise provided below in this _Section 5.4_: (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage any proposal or inquiry that constitutes, or is reasonably
likely to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) other than informing Persons
of the provisions contained in this _Section 5.4_, enter into, continue or
participate in any discussions or any negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal or any proposal or inquiry that is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal; (iii) approve, endorse, recommend an
Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or inquiry that is reasonably likely to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or approve, endorse, recommend or enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or other 

 



47  Contract relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or inquiry that
is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or which would
require the Company to abandon or terminate its obligations under this
Agreement; or (iv) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. The
Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than any Excluded
Party, subject to the following proviso), request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information theretofore furnished to any such
Person (other than any Excluded Party, subject to the following proviso)
concerning the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, cease providing any
further information with respect to the Company or any Acquisition Proposal to
any such Person (other than an Excluded Party, subject to the following
proviso), and terminate access for any such Persons (other than any Excluded
Party, subject to the following proviso) to any physical or electronic data
room; __provided__ , __however__ , that the Company may continue discussions
and negotiations with any Excluded Party until 11:59 p.m. on October 21, 2013
(the " _Excluded Party Deadline_ "), and the restrictions in _Section
5.4(a)(i)_ and  _Section 5.4(a)(ii)_ above shall not apply with respect
thereto until after the Excluded Party Deadline (and thereafter the provisions
of _Section 5.4(a)(i)_ and _Section 5.4(a)(ii)_ above shall apply with
respect to such Excluded Party).

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.4_ to the contrary, at any
time prior to the earlier of the Acceptance Time and the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Vote, in response to an unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal (or an Acquisition Proposal made by an Excluded Party prior to the
Excluded Party Deadline) which was made or renewed on or after the date of
this Agreement and did not result from any breach of this _Section 5.4_ that
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal, the Company may, upon a good faith determination by the
Company Board (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel) that failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law: (A) furnish information with respect to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal (and such Persons Representatives); __provided__ ,  _ _however__ ,
that the Company and such Person enter into a customary confidentiality and
standstill agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable in
the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement; and __provided further__ , that any material non-
public information concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary provided
or made available to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal shall, to the
extent not previously provided to Purchaser or Parent, be provided or made
available to Purchaser or Parent promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
after it is provided to such Person making such Acquisition Proposal; and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Acquisition
Proposal.

(c) The Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing, in no event later
than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal
(including, for the avoidance of doubt any Acquisition Proposal received from
any Excluded Party) and shall, unless expressly prohibited by the terms of an
agreement of confidentiality or non-disclosure in effect as of the date
hereof, indicate the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
and the material terms and conditions of any proposal or offer or the nature
of any inquiries or contacts, and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably
informed of all material developments

 



48  affecting the status and the material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal. The Company agrees that it and the Company Subsidiaries will not
enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the
date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing any information to
Parent in accordance with this _Section 5.4_ or otherwise prohibit the
Company from complying with its obligations under this  _Section 5.4_.

(d) The Company Board shall not: (A) fail to make, withhold, withdraw, amend,
qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent,
the Company Board Recommendation (including any failure to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9, when mailed) (a " _Change in
Company Board Recommendation_ "); or (B) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or
otherwise declare advisable (or make any public announcement of its decision
to adopt, approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable) any Acquisition
Proposal or the adoption thereof or any Contract with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, that would require, or would reasonably be expected to
cause the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that
would otherwise materially impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the
Transactions, or allow the Company or any Company Subsidiary to execute or
enter into any such Contract (other than a confidentiality agreement of
the type permitted by _Section 5.4(b)_). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company Board may, at any time prior to the earlier of the Acceptance Time and
the Company Stockholder Vote:

 

(i) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board
may effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation in response to a Change
in Circumstance, if: (A) the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
(B) the Company shall have given Parent written notice of its intention to
make such a Change in Company Board Recommendation (a " _Recommendation Change
Notice_ "); and (C) (1) the Company shall have specified the Change in
Circumstance in reasonable detail, (2) the Company shall have given Parent two
(2) Business Days after Parents receipt of the Recommendation Change Notice
to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal
so that such Change in Circumstance would no longer necessitate a Change in
Company Board Recommendation, and shall have negotiated in good faith with
Parent with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, and
(3) after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to
the proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with outside counsel,
the Company Board shall have, following such two (2) Business Day
period, determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the Change in
Company Board Recommendation in response to such Change in Circumstance would
reasonably constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 5.4(d)(i)_ shall
apply to any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such
Change in Circumstance and require a new Recommendation Change Notice and a
new two (2) Business Day period; and

(ii) if the Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal (which
Acquisition Proposal did not arise out of a breach of this _Section 5.4_)
from any Person that has not been withdrawn and after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside counsel, the Company Board shall have concluded,
in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, then
the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ to
enter

 



49  into a Company Acquisition Agreement providing for such Superior Proposal,
if: (A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably constitute a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (B) the Company shall
have given Parent written notice of its intention to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ in response to a Superior Proposal (a "
_Superior Proposal Notice_ ") (which notice shall contain a description of the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, including a copy of
the Company Acquisition Agreement in the form to be entered into (it being
understood and agreed that the delivery of such Superior Proposal Notice shall
not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a Change in Company Board
Recommendation)); and (C) (1) the Company shall have given Parent two (2)
Business Days after Parents receipt of the Superior Proposal Notice to
propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make a new or modified
proposal so that such Acquisition Proposal, in light of such proposed
revisions or new or modified proposal by Parent, would no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal, and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent with
respect to such proposed revisions or new or modified proposal, if any, and
(2)after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to
such proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with outside
counsel, the Company Board shall have, following such two (2) Business Day
period, determined, in good faith, that the Acquisition Proposal that is the
subject of the Superior Proposal Notice is a Superior Proposal and that the
failure to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ would
reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board
under applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this
_Section 5.4(d)(ii)_ shall also apply to any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the Superior Proposal Notice and
require a new Superior Proposal Notice and a new two (2) Business Day period.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making
any disclosure to the Companys stockholders with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal if, in the good-faith judgment of the Company Board, after
consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; __provided__
, __however__ , that this _Section 5.4(e)_ shall not limit or otherwise
affect the obligations of the Company and the Company Board and the rights of
Purchaser and Parent under _Section 5.4(d)_ of this Agreement, to the extent
applicable to such disclosure (it being understood that a "stop, look and
listen" letter of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be a Change in Company Board
Recommendation).

5.5 Reasonable Best Efforts.

 

(a) Each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to make or cause
to be made, in cooperation with the other parties hereto and to the extent
applicable: (i) within five (5) Business Days after the Agreement Date an

actions reasonably necessary consistent with this _Section 5.5_ to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Law relating to the Offer and the Merger. In
connection with the foregoing, each party hereto shall use its reasonable
best efforts: (w) to give the other party reasonable prior notice of any
communication with, and any proposed understanding or agreement with, any
Governmental Body regarding any investigations, proceedings, filings, forms,
declarations, notifications, registrations or notices, and permit the other to
review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other in connection with, any proposed communication, understanding or
agreement with any Governmental Body, in each case under any Antitrust Law

appropriate confidentiality agreement and the advice of such partys antitrust

to participate in any meeting or conversation with any Governmental Body in
respect of any filings or inquiry under any Antitrust Law relating to the
Offer and the Merger; (y) if attending a meeting, conference, or conversation

the applicable Governmental Body from participating in or attending, to keep
the other reasonably apprised with respect thereto; and (z) to consult and
cooperate with the other party in connection with any information or
proposals submitted in connection with any proceeding, inquiry, or other
proceeding under any Antitrust Law relating to the Offer and the Merger.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall each use its

eliminate every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Body so as to enable the Effective Time to occur as soon as
reasonably possible (and in any event, not later than the Outside Date). For
purposes of this _Section 5.5(a)_, " _reasonable best efforts_ " shall
include (I) contesting and resisting any Legal Proceeding, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Restraint that restricts, prevents
or prohibits the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law; and (II)
the obligation by Parent, Purchaser, and any of their Subsidiaries to offer
and consent to, and thereafter to implement, any of the following measures if
doing so would enable the parties to avoid, resolve, or lift a Restraint or
Legal Proceeding under this _Section 5.5(a)_: (i) sell, license, assign,
transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business
or portion of business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent,
Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or (ii) impose any
restriction, requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or
portion of the business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent,
Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries; __provided__ that, if
requested by Parent, the Company will become subject to, consent to, or offer
or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any such
requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long
as such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order
is only binding on the Company in the event the Closing occurs.

 



51 (b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Purchaser, Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties hereto in
doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary actions or non-actions,
waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from all Governmental
Bodies and make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with all
Governmental Bodies, that are necessary to consummate the Offer and the
Merger; __provided_ , _however__ , that all obligations of the Company,
Purchaser and Parent relating to the Financing shall be governed exclusively
by _Section 5.13_, and not this _Section 5.5_.

 

5.6 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Except as permitted in
accordance with _Section 5.4_, Parent and the Company shall thereafter

and consider in good faith the views of the other party, and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities
exchange or trading market on which securities of Parent or the Company are
listed, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement
shall use reasonable best efforts to allow the other party or parties hereto
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance (it being understood that the final form and content of any such
release or announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or
announcement, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party).

 

5.7 Director and Officer Liability.

 

(a) From and after the Offer Closing Date, Purchaser and Parent shall and
shall cause the Company, Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
applicable Subsidiaries, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to: (i)

attorneys fees and expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present
directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (in all of
their capacities) to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have the
right to advancement of expenses as of the Agreement Date by the Company or

other charter and organizational documents of the Companys Subsidiaries and
the indemnification agreements in existence on the date hereof with any
directors and officers of the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries;
and (ii) include and cause to be maintained in effect in the Companys or the
Surviving Corporations (or any successors), as the

directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses contained in the Company Charter Documents.

(b) If the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge
into any other corporations or entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then and in each such case, proper

cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such "tail" prepaid policy in full
force and effect for six (6) years after the Merger Closing.

person entitled to the benefit of this  _Section 5.7_, as applicable.

5.8 Notification of Certain Events. Each of the Company and Parent shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, notify the other:

5.11 Employee Matters.

 

(a) For purposes of this _Section 5.11_, (i) the term " _Covered Employees_ "
shall mean employees who are actively employed by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary at the Effective Time; and (ii) the term " _Continuation Period_ "
shall mean the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time.

(b) During the Continuation Period, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or any Company Subsidiary to, provide to the Covered Employees
for so long as such Covered Employees remain employees of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary during the Continuation
Period, compensation (such term to include salary, annual cash bonus
opportunities, commissions and severance) and benefits (including the costs
thereof to Company Employee Benefit Plan participants) that are in the
aggregate, no less favorable than the compensation (excluding any equity or
equity-based compensation, retention, change of control, transaction or
similar bonuses, and nonqualified deferred compensation) and benefits
(excluding, any defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical benefits)
being provided to Covered Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) In the event any Covered Employee first becomes eligible to participate
under any employee benefit plan, program, policy, or arrangement of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries (" _Parent
Employee Benefit Plan_ ") following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, for Covered Employees who become eligible
during the calendar year including the Effective Time, use commercially
reasonable efforts to: (i) waive any preexisting condition exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to any Covered Employee under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan
providing medical, dental, or vision benefits

 



54  to the same extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under
the Company Employee Benefit Plan the Covered Employee participated in
immediately prior to coverage under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan; and
(ii) provide each Covered Employee with credit for any copayments and
deductibles paid prior to the Covered Employees coverage under any Parent
Employee Benefit Plan during the calendar year in which such amount was paid,
to the same extent such credit was given under the employee benefit plan
Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage under the
Parent Employee Benefit Plan, in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-
of-pocket requirements under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan.

(d) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall recognize, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries to recognize, all
service of each Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time, to the Company
(or any predecessor entities of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries) for vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for benefit
accrual purposes) and for purposes of determining future vacation accruals and
severance amounts to the same extent as such Covered Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Company Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, service of each Covered
Employee prior to the Effective Time shall not be recognized for the purpose
of any entitlement to participate in, or receive benefits with respect to, any
(i) non-elective employer contributions under any plan of Parent under Section
401(k) of the Code; or (ii) Parent retiree medical program in which any
Covered Employee participates after the Effective Time. In no event shall
anything contained in this _Section 5.11(e)_ result in any duplication of
benefits for the same period of service.

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 5.11_ shall (i) be construed to limit the right
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company, or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) to amend or terminate any Company Plan or other employee benefit
plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted by the terms
of the applicable plan, (ii) be construed to require Parent, the Company, or
any of the Company Subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation) to retain the employment of any particular Person for
any fixed period of time following the Effective Time, (iii) be construed to
establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement or (iv) is intended to confer upon any individual (including
employees, retirees, or dependents or beneficiaries of employees or retirees)
or entity any right as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

 

 __5.12 Confidentiality __. The parties hereto acknowledge that an Affiliate
of Parent and the Company have previously executed a confidentiality
agreement, dated as of August 6, 2013 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
which Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms, except as expressly modified herein. __

5.13 Financing.

 

(a) Each of Purchaser and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be

obtain the proceeds of the Financing

 



55  on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments,
including using their respective reasonable best efforts to: (i) enforce
(other than through litigation) its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter

enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contained in the Financing Commitments (including the
flex provisions) or on terms no less favorable (taken as a whole), (iii)
satisfy, or cause their Representatives to satisfy, on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to, and within the control of, Parent, Purchaser or

to consummate the Merger) and (B) cause (other than through litigation) the
lenders who are party to the Debt Financing Commitments and any other person
providing Financing to fund the Financing at the Offer Closing (with respect
to amounts required to consummate the Offer) and the Merger Closing (with
respect to amounts required to consummate the Merger).

 

(b) Neither Purchaser nor Parent shall agree to any amendments or
modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other provision
or remedy under the Financing Commitments or Financing Agreements without the
prior written consent of the Company (which may be granted or withheld in the
Companys sole discretion), to the extent such amendments, modifications
or waivers would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of aggregate cash proceeds
available from the Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be
paid or original issue discount unless (x) the Debt Financing or the Equity
Financing is increased by a corresponding amount or (y) the Debt Financing is
otherwise made available to fund such fees or original issue discount) to fund
the amounts required to be paid by Purchaser or Parent under this Agreement
(as compared to the amount of such aggregate proceeds contemplated under the
Financing Commitments as in effect on the date hereof), or (ii) impose new or
additional conditions precedent or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any
of the conditions precedent in a manner adverse to Purchaser, Parent or the
Company, including any expansion, amendment or modification that would be
reasonably likely to (A) prevent or delay or impair the ability of Purchaser
and Parent to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions,
(B) adversely impact the ability of Purchaser or Parent to enforce its rights
or remedies against the other parties to the Financing Commitments or
Financing Agreements or (C) make the timely funding of the Financing or
satisfaction of the conditions precedent to obtaining the Financing any less
likely to occur. Neither Purchaser nor Parent shall release or consent to the
termination of the obligations of the lenders and other Persons under
the Financing Commitments or Financing Agreements.

(c) Except as required by _Section 5.13(d)_, to the extent it
would reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent consummation of all
or any portion of the Financing neither Purchaser nor Parent, directly or
indirectly, shall seek or obtain any equity commitments or equity financing in
respect of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, or provide
any information in respect thereof to any potential investor in Purchaser or
Parent, or any of Purchasers, Parents or such investors financing sources
or potential financing sources or other Representatives who have not been
provided such information prior to the date hereof, other than as set forth in
the Equity Financing Commitment as in effect on the date hereof.

 



56 (d) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes or could become
unavailable in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Financing
Commitments or Financing Agreements, (i) Parent shall promptly so notify the
Company and (ii) Purchaser and Parent shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from the same or
alternative financial institutions in an amount sufficient to consummate the
Transactions on terms and conditions that are not materially less favorable,
in the aggregate, to Purchaser and Parent than those in the Financing
Commitments that such alternative financing would replace (taking into account
any flex provisions), as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event. The definitive agreements entered into pursuant to the first
sentence of this _Section 5.13(d)_ or _Section 5.13(a)(ii)_ are referred to
in this Agreement, collectively, as the " _Financing Agreements_." In the
event any new Financing Commitment is obtained in accordance herewith, (A) any
reference in this _Section 5.13_ to the "Financing," the "Equity Financing"
or the "Debt Financing" shall mean the financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitment(s) as permitted to be modified pursuant to this _Section
5.13_, and (B) any reference in this _Section 5.13_ to the
"Financing Agreements" or the "Financing Commitments" shall be deemed to
include the Financing Commitment(s) that are not superseded by a new Financing
Commitment at the time in question and the new Financing Commitment(s) to the
extent then in effect. Without first obtaining the Companys prior written
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
neither Purchaser nor Parent shall directly or indirectly take any action that
would, or would be reasonably expected to, result in the Financing not being
available.

(e) Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed
copies of the Financing Agreements or any alternative financing agreement
entered into in accordance with this _Section 5.13_ promptly upon their
execution, (ii) give the Company prompt written notice of any breach
or threatened breach of which either Purchaser or Parent is or becomes aware
by any party of any of the Financing Commitments, any alternative financing
commitment, the Financing Agreements, or any alternative financing agreement
entered into in accordance with this _Section 5.13_ of which Purchaser or
Parent is or becomes aware or any termination or threatened termination
thereof, and (iii) otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed in a timely
manner of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or any
alternative financing under this _Section 5.13_).

later than the second (2nd) Business Day following termination pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)_ and prior to or concurrently with any termination pursuant
to _Section 7.1(h)_.

 

(b) If (i) after the date of this Agreement but prior to the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, an Acquisition Proposal shall
have become publicly known or delivered to the Company Board and not
withdrawn, (ii) thereafter, this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ where the failure of the Acceptance
Time to occur prior to the Outside Date is attributable to the failure of the
Minimum Condition to have been satisfied, or (B) by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(e)_ for willful and material breach which willful and material
breach is the principal factor in the failure of the Offer to be consummated
(unless the Company Termination Fee provided in _Section 7.3(a)_ has already
been paid pursuant to the terms thereof), and (iii) within twelve (12) months
after such termination, (X) the Company shall have entered into a definitive
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and an Acquisition
Transaction for such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated or (Y)
consummates an Acquisition Transaction, then the Company shall pay to Parent
the Company Termination Fee (less, if applicable, the Expense Reimbursement
previously paid to Parent by the Company) by wire transfer of same-day funds
on the date such transaction is consummated; __provided_ _that__ solely for
purposes of this _Section 7.3(b)_, all references to 20% in the definition of
"Acquisition Transaction" shall be deemed to be references to 80%. 

 



64 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to  _Section 7.1(f)_ or _Section 7.1(g)_ (for willful and material breach),
then Parent shall pay to the Company the Parent Termination Fee. The Parent
Termination Fee payable pursuant to this _Section 7.3(c)_ shall be paid no
later than the second (2nd) Business Day following termination pursuant to
_Section 7.1(f)_ or _Section 7.1(g)_ (it being understood that in no event

to exceed $5,333,960 (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ "), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds on the second business day following the date of
such termination of this Agreement; __provided__ , that the existence of
circumstances which would require the Company Termination Fee (less any
Expense Reimbursement previously paid to Parent by the Company) to become
subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ shall not
relieve the Company of its obligations to pay the Expense Reimbursement
pursuant to this _Section 7.3(d)_; and __provided__ ,  _ _further__ , that
the payment by the Company of the Expense Reimbursement pursuant to this
_Section 7.3(d)_ shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation
to pay the Company Termination Fee (less any Expense Reimbursement previously
paid to Parent by the Company) pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_.

(e) All payments under this  _Section 7.3_ shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the party
to whom payment is owed.

 

(f) Subject to _Section 8.7_ and notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent and Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that its receipt of the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ and the
Expense Reimbursement pursuant to  _Section 7.3(d)_, if applicable, shall,
except in the case of Fraud or willful or intentional breach by the Company,
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement of Parent and
Purchaser and each of their Affiliates and Representatives, and the receipt
of the Company Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement, if applicable, shall
be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered
or incurred by Parent, Purchaser, each of their Affiliates and
Representatives and any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and
the termination hereof), the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment or termination
thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of
Parent, Purchaser, their respective Affiliates or Representatives or any other
Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Legal Proceeding against
the Company or its Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination
thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such termination.

(g) Subject to _Section 8.7_ and notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company acknowledges and agrees on behalf of
itself, the Company Subsidiaries, its Affiliates and their respective current,
former or future stockholders, general or limited partners, controlling
persons, managers, members, employees, directors,

 



65  officers, agents and each of their Representatives (collectively, the "
_Company Related Parties_ "), that the Companys receipt of the Parent
Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 7.3(c)_, shall, except in the
case of Fraud or willful or intentional breach by Parent or Purchaser,
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company Related Parties
against Parent, Purchaser, Sponsor, the Financing Sources or any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
shareholders, managers, members, directors, officers or Affiliates
(collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a
result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Equity Commitment Letter, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing, the
Guaranty, the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated or for a breach or failure
to perform hereunder or otherwise relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Guaranty, the Offer, the Top-Up
Option, the Merger or the other Transactions. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee shall be deemed liquidated damages for, and none of the Parent
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out, of this Agreement the Equity Commitment Letter, the Debt
Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing, the Guaranty, the Offer, the Top-Up
Option, the Merger or the other Transactions, and neither the Company nor
any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Legal Proceedings
against Parent, Purchaser or any other Parent Related Parties arising out of
or in connection with the foregoing (or the abandonment or termination
thereof) or any matters forming the basis of such termination. The Company
shall not be entitled to specific performance under _Section 8.7_ if Parent
has paid in full, and the Company has accepted, the Parent Termination Fee and
in no event shall the Company or its Affiliates be permitted or entitled to
receive both a grant of specific performance and the Parent Termination Fee;
_provided_ , _however_ , and, for further clarity, in any circumstance where
performance by Parent or Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement
would relieve Parent of its obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee the
Company may, in its sole discretion: (i) seek specific performance pursuant to
_Section 8.7(b)_, (ii) withdraw any claim for specific performance and
require payment of the Parent Termination Fee if entitled to payment of the
Parent Termination Fee under _Section 7.3(c)_, or (iii) if the Company is
unable for any reason to obtain specific performance, require payment of the
Parent Termination Fee if entitled to payment of the Parent Termination Fee
under _Section 7.3(c)_.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall (i) any Parent Related Party, excluding Sponsor, Parent and Purchaser)
have any liability for monetary damages to the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries or any other Company Related Party (whether at law, in contract,
in tort or otherwise) relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, other than Sponsors obligations under
the Guarantee and the Equity Commitment Letter and other than the obligations
of Parent and Purchaser as provided herein, or (ii) any former, current or
future general or limited partners, equity holders, directors, officers,
employees, managers, members, Affiliates or agents of the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries have any liability to Sponsor, Parent or Purchaser or any
Related Party for monetary damages (whether at law, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. In no event shall the Company seek or obtain, nor shall
it permit any of its Representatives to seek or obtain, nor shall any Person
be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary award against
any Related Party with respect to, this Agreement, the Equity Commitment
Letter or the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(including, any breach by Sponsor, Parent or

 



66  Purchaser), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any claims or actions under
applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure, other
than from Parent or Purchaser to the extent expressly provided for in this
Agreement or Sponsor to the extent expressly provided for in the Guarantee or
the Equity Commitment Letter. Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall be entitled
to specific performance under _Section 8.7_ if the Company has paid in full,
and Parent or Purchaser has accepted, the Company Termination Fee and in no
event shall Parent or Purchaser or their respective Affiliates be permitted
or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and the Company
Termination Fee; _provided_ , _however_ , and, for further clarity, in any
circumstance where performance by the Company of its obligations under
this Agreement would relieve the Company of its obligation to pay the Company
Termination Fee, Parent may, in its sole discretion: (i) seek specific
performance pursuant to _Section 8.7_, (ii) withdraw any claim for
specific performance and require payment of the Company Termination Fee if
entitled to payment of the Company Termination Fee under _Section 7.3(a)_, or

Company Related Party shall have any rights or claims against any of the

transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law, in contract, in
tort or otherwise; and (ii) no Financing Source shall have any liability or
obligation to the Company or any of its stockholders, Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, controlling persons or agents relating to or arising out
of this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein shall
restrict the ability of the Company to seek specific performance of Parents
or Purchasers obligations hereunder in connection with the Debt Financing
pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 8.7_.

 

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the
case of Fraud, in no event shall the Company Related Parties be entitled to
monetary recovery, award or fees in excess of the amount of $64,007,521 in the
aggregate (the " _Parent Liability Limitation_ ") for, or with respect to,
this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Guarantee or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including, any breach by
Sponsor, Parent or Purchaser), the termination of this Agreement, the failure
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any claims
or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination
or failure. Except in the case of Fraud, in no event shall the Company Related
Parties seek or obtain, nor shall they permit any of their Representatives or
any other Person on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor shall any Person be
entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery, award or fees in excess of
the Parent Liability Limitation against the Parent Related Parties, and in no
event shall the Company or any Company Subsidiary be entitled to seek or
obtain any monetary recovery, award or fees of any kind in excess of the
Parent Liability Limitation against the Parent Related Parties, including

this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Guarantee or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including, any breach by
Sponsor, Parent or Purchaser), the termination of this Agreement, the failure
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any claims
or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or
failure.

 



67 (k) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither
the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the fee due
pursuant to _Section 7.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or
the Company commences litigation that results in an award against the other
party for such fee, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall pay to
the other party its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such litigation, together with interest on
the amount of the applicable fee from the date such payment was required to
be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made.

8.7 Specific Enforcement.

provisions of this Agreement are not performed by the other party in
accordance with the terms hereof or are otherwise breached, and that each
party shall be entitled to specific performance and the issuance of injunctive
and other equitable relief in any such event and prior to the valid exercise

written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any

not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed
an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time,
subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. EXHIBIT A

harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently

is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or is otherwise involved
in, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative in nature (a "proceeding"),
by reason of the fact that such Covered Person, or a person for whom he or she
is the legal representative, is or was, at any time during which this Section

directors of the Corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in
this Section (a) of Article Eight and such rights as may be conferred in the

prosecuting such claim.

 



2 (c) Non Exclusivity of Rights. In accordance with the By-laws of the
Corporation, the right to indemnification and the payment of expenses
incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition
conferred any Covered Person by Section (a) of this Article Eight (i) shall
not be exclusive of any other rights which such Covered Person may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Certificate of
Incorporation, the By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise and (ii) cannot be terminated by the Corporation, the
board of directors or the stockholders of the Corporation with respect to a
Covered Persons service occurring prior to the date of such termination.

the Corporation, or is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,

corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive
notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent and (2) such
inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the
corporation or to the transfer agent. Attendance of a person at a meeting

to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called
or convened.

_Section 5 Stockholders List_. The officer who has charge of the stock
ledger of the corporation shall make, at least 10 days before every meeting of
the stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such

stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder,
for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least 10 days
prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network,
provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided
with the notice of the meeting, and/or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at
the principal place of business of the corporation. In the event that the
corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network,
the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is
available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be
held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and
place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by
any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means

of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such
list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.

to another time and/or place.

 

 _Section 7 Adjourned Meetings_. When a meeting is adjourned to another time
and place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time,
place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by

2  person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at
which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may
transact any business which might have been transacted at the original
meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the
adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of
the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled
to vote at the meeting.

_Section 8 Vote Required_. When a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of
the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the
stockholders, unless the question is one upon which by express provisions of
an applicable law or of the corporations certificate of incorporation a
different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern
and control the decision of such question.

 

 _Section 9 Voting Rights_. Except as otherwise provided by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or by the corporations certificate
of incorporation or any amendments thereto and subject to Section 3 of Article
VI hereof, every stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be
entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of common stock
held by such stockholder.

_Section 10 Proxies_. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting
of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for
such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon
after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer
period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is
irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made
irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an
interest in the stock itself or an interest in the corporation generally. Any
proxy is suspended when the person executing the proxy is present at
a meeting of stockholders and elects to vote, except that when such proxy is
coupled with an interest and the fact of the interest appears on the face of
the proxy, the agent named in the proxy shall have all voting and other rights
referred to in the proxy, notwithstanding the presence of the person
executing the proxy. At each meeting of the stockholders, and before any
voting commences, all proxies filed at or before the meeting shall be
submitted to and examined by the secretary or a person designated by the
secretary, and no shares may be represented or voted under a proxy that has
been found to be invalid or irregular.

 

 _Section 11 Action by Written Consent_. Unless otherwise provided in the
corporations certificate of incorporation, any action required to be taken
at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any
action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such
stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without
a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so
taken and bearing the dates of signature of the stockholders who signed the
consent or consents, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock
having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to
vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the corporation
by delivery to its registered office in the state of Delaware, or the
corporations principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the
corporation having custody of the book or books in which proceedings of
meetings of the stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the corporations
registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested or by reputable overnight courier service. All consents
properly delivered in accordance with this section shall be deemed to
be recorded when so delivered. No written consent shall be effective to take
the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days after the
earliest dated consent delivered to the corporation as required by this
section, written consents signed by the holders of a sufficient number of
shares to take such corporate action are so recorded. Prompt notice of the
taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous
written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented
in writing. Any action taken pursuant to such written consent or consents of
the stockholders shall have the same force and effect as if taken by the
stockholders at a meeting thereof.

 



3 Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may
be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all
purposes for which the original writing could be used; provided that such
copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the
entire original writing.

 

 _Section 12 Action by Facsimile, Email or Other Electronic Transmission
Consent_. A facsimile, email or other electronic transmission by a
stockholder or proxyholder (or by any person authorized to act on such
persons behalf) of a proxy or a written consent to an action to be taken
(including the delivery of such a document in the .pdf, .tif, .gif, .peg
or similar format attached to an email message) shall be deemed to be
written, signed, dated and delivered to the corporation for the purposes of
this Article; _provided_ that any such facsimile, email or other electronic
transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the
corporation can determine (A) that the facsimile, email or other electronic
transmission was transmitted by the stockholder or proxyholder or by a person
authorized to act for the stockholder or proxyholder and (B) the date on
which such stockholder or proxyholder or authorized person transmitted such
facsimile, email or other electronic transmission. The date on which such
facsimile, email or other electronic transmission is transmitted shall be
deemed to be the date on which such consent or proxy was signed. Any such
facsimile, email or other electronic transmission of a consent or proxy shall
be treated in all respects as an original executed consent or proxy and shall
be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of the board of
directors or the Secretary of the corporation, each stockholder, proxyholder
or other authorized person who delivered a consent or proxy by facsimile,
email or other electronic transmission shall re-execute the original form
thereof and deliver such original to the corporation at its registered office
in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or to an officer or
agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of
meetings of stockholders are recorded. No consent given by facsimile, email or
other electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until
such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be
delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State
of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the
corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders are recorded.

shall be managed by or under the direction of the board of directors.

directors which shall constitute the board shall be three (3). Thereafter,
the number of directors shall be established from time to time by resolution
of the board. The directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of
the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote in the election of directors. The directors shall be elected
in this manner at the annual meeting of the stockholders, except as otherwise
provided in Section 4 of this Article III. Each director elected shall hold
office until a successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her
earlier death, resignation or removal as hereinafter provided.

 

 _Section 3 Removal and Resignation_. Any director or the entire board of
directors may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by the holders
of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.

4  directors by the provisions of the corporations certificate of
incorporation, the provisions of this section shall apply, in respect to the
removal without cause of a director or directors so elected, to the vote of
the holders of the outstanding shares of that class or series and not to the
vote of the outstanding shares as a whole. Any director may resign at any time
upon notice given in writing or by electronic transmission to
the corporation.

_Section 4 Vacancies_. Except as otherwise provided in the corporations
certificate of incorporation, board vacancies and newly created directorships
resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be

earlier death, resignation or removal as herein provided.

of directors shall be held without notice (other than notice under these by-
laws) immediately after, and at the same place, if any, as the annual meeting

and/or by electronic transmission.

_Section 7 Quorum, Required Vote and Adjournment_. A majority of the total
number of directors then in office authorized shall constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business. The vote of a majority of directors present at a
meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the board of
directors. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the board of
directors, the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to
time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum
shall be present. Except as otherwise required by the corporations
certificate of incorporation, each director shall be entitled to one vote on
exactly the matter presented to the board for approval.

 

 _Section 8 Committees_. The board of directors may, by resolution passed by
a majority of the whole board, designate one or more committees, each
committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation, which
to the extent provided in such resolution or these by-laws shall have and may
exercise the powers of the board of directors in the management and
affairs of the corporation, except as otherwise limited by law. The board of
directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any
committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of
the committee. Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as
may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the board of
directors. Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and
report the same to the board of directors when required.

_Section 9 Committee Rules_. Each committee of the board of directors may fix
its own rules of procedure and shall hold its meetings as provided by such
rules, except as may otherwise be provided by a resolution of the board of
directors designating such committee. Unless otherwise provided in such a
resolution, the presence of a majority of the members of the committee then
in office shall be necessary to constitute a quorum. In the event that a
member and that members alternate, if alternates are designated by the board
of directors as provided in Section 8 of this Article III, of such committee
is or are absent or disqualified, the member or members thereof present at any
meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or
members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the
board of directors to act at the meeting in place of any such absent or
disqualified member.

 



5 _Section 10 Communications Equipment_. Members of the board of directors or
any committee thereof may participate in and act at any meeting of such board
or committee by means of conference telephone or other communications
equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear
each other, and participation in the meeting pursuant to this section shall
constitute presence in person at the meeting.

_Section 11 Waiver of Notice and Presumption of Assent_. Any member of the
board of directors or any committee thereof who is present at a meeting shall
be conclusively presumed to have waived notice of such meeting, except when
such member attends for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of
the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Such member shall be conclusively presumed to
have assented to any action taken unless his or her dissent shall be entered
in the minutes of the meeting or unless his or her written dissent to such
action shall be filed with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting
before the adjournment thereof or shall be forwarded by registered mail to
the secretary of the corporation immediately after the adjournment of the
meeting. Such right to dissent shall not apply to any member who voted in
favor of such action.

 

 _Section 12 Action by Written Consent_. Unless otherwise restricted by the
corporations certificate of incorporation, any action required or permitted
to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors, or of any committee
thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board or
committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by
electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic
transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the
board, or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are
maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are
maintained in electronic form.

ARTICLE V __

 

 _INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND OTHERS_

 

 _Section 1 Indemnification_. The corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently
exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment,
only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide
broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the corporation to
provide prior to such amendment), any person (a "Covered Person") who was or
is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or is otherwise involved
in, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative in nature (a "proceeding"),
by reason of the fact that such Covered Person, or a person for whom he or she
is the legal representative, is or was, at any time during 

 



7  which these by-laws are in effect (whether or not such Covered Person
continues to serve in such capacity at the time any indemnification or payment
of expenses pursuant hereto is sought or at the time any proceeding relating
thereto exists or is brought), a director or officer of the corporation, or
has or had agreed to become a director of the corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee,
employee or agent of another corporation, limited liability company,
partnership, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust, nonprofit entity or
other enterprise, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent or in
any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, trustee, employee or
agent, against all liability and loss suffered (including, without limitation,
any judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in
settlement) and expenses (including attorneys fees), actually and reasonably
incurred by such Covered Person in connection with such proceeding to the
fullest extent permitted by law, and such indemnification shall continue as
to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, trustee, employee or
agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and
administrators, and the corporation may enter into agreements with any such
person for the purpose of providing for such indemnification. Except as
provided in Section 3 of this Article V, the corporation shall be required to
indemnify a person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such person only if the proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized by the board of directors. The right to indemnification conferred
in this Article V shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the
expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by a Covered Person in
defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition, such
advances to be paid by the corporation within sixty (60) days after the
receipt by the corporation of a statement or statements from the claimant
requesting such advance or advances from time to time (and subject to filing a
written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 2 of this Article V);
provided, however, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director
or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any
other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a
director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee
benefit plan) shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of the Covered Person to repay all amounts advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no
further right of appeal that the Covered Person is not entitled to be
indemnified by the corporation for such expenses under this Article V or
otherwise. The rights conferred upon Covered Persons in this Article V shall
be contract rights that vest at the time of such persons service to or at
the request of the corporation and such rights shall continue as to a Covered
Person who has ceased to be a director, officer, trustee, employee or agent
and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitees heirs, executors and
administrators.

 

 _Section 2_ To obtain indemnification under this Article V, a claimant shall
submit to the corporation a written request, including therein or therewith
such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the claimant
and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the
claimant is entitled to indemnification. Upon written request by a
claimant for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2
of Article V, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to
the claimants entitlement thereto shall be made as follows: (a) if requested
by the claimant, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined), or (b) if
no request is made by the claimant for a determination by Independent Counsel,
(1) by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of
Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), or (2) if a quorum of the
board of directors consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or,
even if obtainable, such quorum of Disinterested Directors so directs, by
Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the board of directors, a copy of
which shall be delivered to the claimant, or (3) if a quorum of Disinterested
Directors so directs, by the stockholders of the corporation. In the event the
determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent
Counsel at the request of the claimant, the Independent Counsel shall be
selected by the board of directors unless there shall have occurred within two
(2) years prior to the date of the commencement of the action, suit or
proceeding for which indemnification is claimed a change of control of the
corporation is consummated, in which case the Independent Counsel shall be
selected by the claimant unless the claimant shall request that
such selection be made by the board of directors. If it is so determined that
the claimant is entitled to indemnification, payment to the claimant shall be
made within sixty (60) days after such determination.

 



8 _Section 3_ If a claim for indemnification under Section 1 of this Article V
is not paid in full within sixty (60) days after a written claim pursuant to
Section 2 of this Article V has been received by the corporation, the claimant
may at any time thereafter file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such
claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid
the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such
action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred
in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the
required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant
has not met the standard of conduct which makes it permissible under the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the corporation to
indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such
defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation
(including its board of directors, Independent Counsel or stockholders) to
have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or
she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the
corporation (including its board of directors, Independent Counsel or
stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

_Section 4_ The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses
incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition
conferred on any Covered Person by this Article V (a) shall not be exclusive
of any other rights which such Covered Person may have or hereafter
acquire under any statute, provision of these by-laws, agreement, vote of
stockholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise and (b) cannot be
terminated by the corporation, the board of directors or the stockholders of
the corporation with respect to a Covered Persons service occurring prior to
the date of such termination. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
corporations obligation to indemnify or to advance expenses to any Covered
Person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint
venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any amount
such person has collected as indemnification from such other corporation,
limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, nonprofit
entity, or other enterprise; and, in the event the corporation has fully paid
such expenses, the Covered Person shall return to the corporation any amounts
subsequently received from such other source of indemnification.

_Section 5_ Any repeal, amendment, alteration or modification of the
provisions of this Article V that in any way diminishes, limits, restricts,
adversely affects or eliminates any right of an indemnitee or his or her
successors to indemnification, advancement of expenses or otherwise shall
be prospective only and shall not in any way diminish, limit, restrict,
adversely affect or eliminate any such right with respect to any actual or
alleged state of facts, occurrence, action or omission then or previously
existing, or any action, suit or proceeding previously or thereafter brought
or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such actual or alleged state
of facts, occurrence, action or omission.

 

 _Section 6_ This Article V shall not limit the right of the corporation, to
the extent and in the manner permitted by law, to indemnify and advance
expenses to persons other than Covered Persons when and as authorized by the
board of directors.

 

 _Section 7_ If any provision or provisions of this Article V shall be held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Article V (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of
this Article V containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (b)
to the

 



9  fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article V (including,
without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph of this Article V
containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable)
shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the
provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

 

 _Section 8 Definitions_. For purposes of this Article V: (1) "Disinterested
Director" means a director of the corporation who is not and was not a party
to the matter in respect of which indemnification is sought by the claimant;
(2) "Independent Counsel" means a law firm, a member of a law firm, or an
independent practitioner, that is experienced in matters of corporation law
and shall include any person who, under the applicable standards of
professional conduct then prevailing, would not have a conflict of interest in
representing either the corporation or the claimant in an action to determine
the claimants rights under this Article V.

_Section 9 Notice_. Any notice, request or other communication required or
permitted to be given to the corporation under this Article V shall be in
writing and either delivered in person or sent by telecopy, telex, telegram,
overnight mail or courier service, or certified or registered mail, postage
prepaid, return receipt requested, to the secretary of the corporation and
shall be effective only upon receipt by the secretary.

 

ARTICLE VI

_CERTIFICATES OF STOCK_

_Section 1 Form_. Every holder of stock in the corporation shall be entitled
to have a certificate, signed by, or in the name of the corporation by the
president or a vice-president and the secretary or an assistant secretary of
the corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by such holder in the
corporation. If such a certificate is countersigned (1) by a transfer agent
or an assistant transfer agent other than the corporation or its employee or
(2) by a registrar, other than the corporation or its employee, the signature
of any such president, vice-president, secretary, or assistant secretary may
be facsimiles. In case any officer or officers who have signed, or whose
facsimile signature or signatures have been used on, any such certificate or
certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers of the
corporation whether because of death, resignation or otherwise before such
certificate or certificates have been delivered by the corporation, such
certificate or certificates may nevertheless be issued and delivered as though
the person or persons who signed such certificate or certificates or whose
facsimile signature or signatures have been used thereon had not ceased to be
such officer or officers of the corporation. All certificates for shares shall
be consecutively numbered or otherwise identified. The name of the person to
whom the shares represented thereby are issued, with the number of shares and
date of issue, shall be entered on the books of the corporation. Shares of
stock of the corporation shall only be transferred on the books of
the corporation by the holder of record thereof or by such holders attorney
duly authorized in writing, upon surrender to the corporation of the
certificate or certificates for such shares endorsed by the appropriate person
or persons, with such evidence of the authenticity of such endorsement,
transfer, authorization, and other matters as the corporation may reasonably
require, and accompanied by all necessary stock transfer stamps. In that
event, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to
the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate or certificates, and
record the transaction on its books. The board of directors may appoint a bank
or trust company organized under the laws of the United States or any state
thereof to act as its transfer agent or registrar, or both in connection with
the transfer of any class or series of securities of the corporation.

 

 _Section 2 Lost Certificates_. The board of directors may direct a new
certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or
certificates previously issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost,
stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed.
When authorizing such issue of a new

 



10  certificate or certificates, the board of directors may, in its discretion
and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of
such lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his or her
legal representative, to give the corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify
the corporation against any claim that may be made against the corporation on
account of the loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the
issuance of such new certificate.

_Section 3 Fixing a Record Date for Stockholder Meetings_. In order that the
corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at
any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the board of directors
may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors,
and which record date shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days
before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the board of
directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of
or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be the close of business on the
next day preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived,
at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the
meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice
of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of
the meeting; provided that the board of directors may fix a new record date
for the adjourned meeting.

_Section 4 Fixing a Record Date for Action by Written Consent_. In order that
the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix
a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and
which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. If no
record date has been fixed by the board of directors, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required
by statute, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting
forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation
by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal
place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having
custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are
recorded. Delivery made to the corporations registered office shall be by
hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no
record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the
board of directors is required by statute, the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of
directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

_Section 5 Fixing a Record Date for Other Purposes_. In order that the
corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any
dividend or other distribution or allotment or any rights or the stockholders
entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or
exchange of stock, or for the purposes of any other lawful action, the board
of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which
record date shall be not more than sixty days prior to such action. If no
record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any
such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board
of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

_Section 6 Registered Stockholders_. Prior to the surrender to the
corporation of the certificate or certificates for a share or shares of stock
with a request to record the transfer of such share or shares, the corporation
may treat the registered owner as the person entitled to receive dividends, to
vote, to receive notifications, and otherwise to exercise all the rights and
powers of an owner. The corporation shall not be bound to recognize any
equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of
any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice
thereof.

 



11 _Section 7 Subscriptions for Stock_. Unless otherwise provided for in the
subscription agreement, subscriptions for shares shall be paid in full at
such time, or in such installments and at such times, as shall be determined
by the board of directors. Any call made by the board of directors for payment
on subscriptions shall be uniform as to all shares of the same class or as to
all shares of the same series. In case of default in the payment of any
installment or call when such payment is due, the corporation may proceed to
collect the amount due in the same manner as any debt due the corporation.

certificate of incorporation. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set
aside out of any funds of the corporation available for dividends such sum or
sums as the directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think

other corporation or other entity (such as a limited liability company,
limited partnership or trust) held by the corporation shall be voted as
directed by the board of directors, unless the board of directors specifically

 



12  confers authority to vote with respect thereto, which authority may be
general or confined to specific instances, upon some other person or officer.
Any person authorized to vote securities shall have the power to appoint
proxies, with general power of substitution.

_Section 8 Inspection of Books and Records_. Any stockholder of record, in
person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath
stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for
business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporations stock ledger, a
list of its stockholders, and its other books and records, and to make copies
or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean any purpose reasonably
related to such persons interest as a stockholder. In every instance where
an attorney or other agent shall be the person who seeks the right to
inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney
or such other writing which authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act
on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the
corporation at its registered office in the State of Delaware or at its
principal place of business.

 

 _Section 9 Exclusive Jurisdiction_. Unless otherwise waived by resolution of
the Board, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole
and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on
behalf of the corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a
fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer of the corporation to the
corporation or the corporations stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a
claim against the corporation arising pursuant to any provision of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or the corporations certificate of
incorporation or by-laws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the
corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine.

 

 _Section 10 Section Headings_. Section headings in these by-laws are for
convenience of reference only and shall not be given any substantive effect
in limiting or otherwise construing any provision herein.

_Section 11 Inconsistent Provisions_. In the event that any provision of
these by-laws is or becomes inconsistent with any provision of the
corporations certificate of incorporation, the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware or any other applicable law, the provision of these by-laws
shall not be given any effect to the extent of such inconsistency but shall
otherwise be given full force and effect.

ARTICLE VIII 

_AMENDMENTS_

These by-laws may be amended, altered, or repealed and new by-laws adopted at
any meeting of the board of directors by a majority vote. The fact that the
power to adopt, amend, alter, or repeal the by-laws has been conferred upon
the board of directors shall not divest the stockholders of the same powers.
