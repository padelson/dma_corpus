23B.11.050(1) of the WBCA.

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set

Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and bylaws

prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Charter Documents_
"), shall be amended as of the Effective Time to be in the form of (except
with respect to the name of the Company (which shall remain "Avista
Corporation") and any changes necessary so that they shall be in compliance
with _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ and the requirements set forth on _Exhibit A_
attached hereto) the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub as of
the date hereof and as so amended shall be the articles of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided

2 Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that within one (1) Business
Day immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall take, or shall
cause US Parent and the Surviving Corporation to take, all such actions as are

ARTICLE II

_EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK_

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, US
Parent or Merger Sub or any holder of any shares of common stock, no par
value, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of capital
stock of Merger Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub; Issuance of Common Stock by Surviving
Corporation_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger
Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving
Corporation. In consideration for US Parent paying, or causing to be paid the
Merger Consideration as provided herein, the Surviving Corporation shall issue
ten million (10,000,000) fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock,
no par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation to US Parent or as
otherwise directed by US Parent.

(b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned Stock_. Any shares of Company Common Stock
that are owned by Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share
of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shareholder Shares and shares
to be cancelled in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_) shall thereupon be
converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent solely the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to $53.00 without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and the holders immediately prior to the Effective Time
of shares of Company Common Stock not represented by certificates (" _Book-
Entry Shares_ ") and the holders of certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented any

 



3  such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of
such Book-Entry Share or Certificate in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.2(b)_ (subject to any withholding of applicable Tax in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_) and any "stub period" cash dividend declared in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.1(a)(iii)_.

(d)  _Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time which are held by a shareholder who
did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who
is entitled to demand and properly demands payment of fair value of such
shares pursuant to, and complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA (the " _Dissenting Shareholder Shares_ ", and each
shareholder holding Dissenting Shareholder Shares, a " _Dissenting
Shareholder_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead such Dissenting Shareholder
shall be entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due
to such Dissenting Shareholder pursuant to Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA (and at
the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shareholder Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
such Dissenting Shareholder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the rights set forth in Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA), unless
and until such Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to demand for payment of fair value
under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
right, such Dissenting Shareholders shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become
exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_, without any interest thereon and subject to any
applicable withholding Tax. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice
of any written demands for payment of fair value of any shares of Company
Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other written
instruments served pursuant to the WBCA and received by the Company relating
to shareholders rights to demand payment of fair value and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for payment of fair value under the WBCA. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to any such demands for payment of fair value or settle or offer to settle any
such demands.

 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent; Investment by Paying Agent of Funds_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank, trust company or nationally
recognized financial institution or transfer services company reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of
exchanging shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration and
enter into an agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company with the Paying
Agent relating to the services to be performed by the Paying Agent. Parent
shall cause US Parent to and US Parent shall irrevocably deposit, or cause to
be deposited (subject to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_), the aggregate Merger
Consideration with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Dissenting Shareholder Shares and shares to be cancelled in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_) with the Paying Agent at or prior to the Effective
Time. The aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent
shall, pending its disbursement to holders of shares of Company Common Stock
and as reasonably directed by Parent (on behalf of US Parent), be invested by
the Paying Agent in (i) short-term commercial paper obligations of issuers
organized under the Laws of a state of the United States of America, rated A-1
or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Ratings Service, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding

 



4  $10,000,000,000, or in mutual funds investing in such assets or (ii) short-
term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest. Any
interest and other income from such investments shall become part of the funds
held by the Paying Agent for purposes of paying the Merger Consideration. No
investment or investment losses resulting from such investment by the Paying
Agent of the aggregate Merger Consideration shall relieve Parent, US Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the payments
required by this _Article II_ , and Parent shall cause US Parent to and US
Parent shall promptly replace any funds deposited with the Paying Agent lost
through any investment made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_;
_provided_ that any interest and other income retained pursuant to
the preceding sentence shall be used to replace such funds prior to
determining Parents obligation to replace or causing US Parent to replace
such funds. No investment by the Paying Agent of the aggregate Merger
Consideration shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to
be made pursuant to this Agreement. Following the Effective Time, Parent
agrees to make or cause to be made available to the Paying Agent, from time to
time as needed, additional cash to pay the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this _Article II_ without interest.

(b) _Payment Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time
(but in no event more than three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which, in the
case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates, shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably agree and shall be prepared prior to Closing) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent or, in the case
of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request), together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, subject to any required withholding Taxes, the Merger
Consideration, for each share of Company Common Stock surrendered, and any
Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (A) the Person requesting
such exchange present proper evidence of transfer and (B) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, each Certificate and
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated
by this _Article II_.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common
Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common
Stock upon the surrender for exchange in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock, and at the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that
evidenced ownership of shares 

 



5  of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common
Stock other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article II_.

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent (on behalf of US Parent) or US
Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to
be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article II_.

 

(e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the first (1st) anniversary
of the Closing Date, US Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it or as directed by it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying
Agent and which have not been disbursed in accordance with this _Article II_ ,
and thereafter Persons entitled to receive payment pursuant to this _Article
II_ shall be entitled to look only to US Parent or the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration
that may be payable upon surrender of any Company Common Stock held by such
holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest
thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of US Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
none of Parent, US Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company
or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

 

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Performance Awards_ ___and RSUs_.

 

(a) _Performance Awards_. At the Effective Time, each Performance Award that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any
Performance Award with respect to which the applicable performance period has
ended, but which Performance Award has not been settled) shall be cancelled
and the holder thereof shall then become entitled to receive, in
full satisfaction of such holders rights with respect thereto, a lump-sum
cash payment equal to the product of (i) the Performance Award Amount, and
(ii) the Merger Consideration, subject to any withholding Taxes required by
Law to be withheld in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.5_. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Performance Award Amount_ " means (A) with respect to any
outstanding Performance Award for which the performance period has ended as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (1) in the case of a share-settled
Performance Award, the number of shares of Company Common Stock that would be
delivered to the holder of such Performance Award, or (2) in the case of a
cash-settled Performance Award, the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that would be deemed deliverable to the holder for purposes of calculating the
cash payment due under such Performance Award, in each case of the foregoing
clauses (1) and (2), based on the actual achievement of the performance goals
applicable to such Performance Award, as reasonably determined by the Board
(or a committee thereof) prior to the Effective Time, and

 



6  assuming the satisfaction of all other conditions to such delivery, and (B)
with respect to any outstanding Performance Award for which the performance
period has not ended as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (1) in
the case of a share-settled Performance Award, the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Performance Award that would be delivered to the
holder of such Performance Award, or (2) in the case of a cash-settled
Performance Award, the number of shares of Company Common Stock that would be
deemed deliverable to the holder for purposes of calculating the cash payment
due under such Performance Award, in each case of the foregoing clauses (1)
and (2), based on deemed satisfaction of the performance goals applicable to
such Performance Award for such incomplete performance period at the target
level, and in each case, assuming the satisfaction of all other conditions
to such delivery. As of the Effective Time, all Accumulated Dividends, if
any, accrued but unpaid with respect to Performance Awards shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of a holder thereof,
automatically become fully vested and be paid to such holder.

(b) _Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each RSU that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which by its terms
would vest before the calendar year or in the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall then
become entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of such holders rights with
respect thereto, a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such cancelled RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration. As
of the Effective Time, all Accumulated Dividends, if any, accrued but unpaid
with respect to such cancelled RSUs shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of a holder thereof, automatically become fully vested
and be paid to such holder. At the Effective Time, each RSU that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which by its terms
would vest in any calendar year following the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs will be adjusted as necessary to provide that, at the
Effective Time, each such RSU shall be converted into a restricted stock unit
award, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including with respect to vesting,
treatment upon employment termination, etc.), with respect to a number of
shares of common stock of Parent determined by multiplying the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole share (a
" _Converted RSU_ "), and each such Converted RSU shall not be accelerated
except as provided in the original related RSU agreement issued by the
Company (the " _RSU Agreement_ "). At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume
all obligations of the Company with respect to the Company Stock Plans and
each outstanding Converted RSU and the RSU Agreements evidencing the grants
thereof. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver
to the holders of Converted RSUs appropriate notices setting forth such
holders rights, and the RSU Agreements evidencing the grants of
such Converted RSUs shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions
(subject to the adjustments required by this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ after giving
effect to the Merger). The Converted RSUs will be settled in shares of
common stock of Parent, which will not be subject to any Canadian hold period
and may be resold by the holder of the Converted RSU on the TSX without any
applicable U.S. restricted period having elapsed, or cash, as determined by
Parent, and Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to effectuate
the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for the purpose of clarity,
it is understood by Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation that the
Converted RSUs shall be awarded and issued under Parents equity-based long-
term incentive compensation plan (the " _Parent LTIP_ "). For the avoidance of
doubt, the terms and conditions applicable to such Converted RSUs shall be the
same as the terms and conditions set forth in the Company Stock Plans and the
RSU Agreements pursuant to which such Converted RSUs were granted,
notwithstanding that the Converted RSUs will be issued under the Parent LTIP.

 



7 (c) _Funding_. No later than the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause to be provided, to the Surviving Corporation all funds necessary
to fulfill the obligations under this _Section_ _2.3_. All payments required
under this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ shall be made through the Surviving
Corporations payroll not later than the later of (i) the first payroll date
immediately following the Effective Time and (ii) five (5) Business Days
following the Effective Time.

 

Section 2.4 _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company (or any other securities convertible or
exchangeable therefor) shall occur as a result of any reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a
record date during such period, or any similar event, the Merger Consideration
shall be equitably adjusted; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto
to effect any such change that such party is not otherwise authorized or
permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 2.5 _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, Parent, US Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or
cause to be deducted and withheld) from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payments under the Code, or under any
applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent amounts
are so withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made (excluding any such amounts required to be withheld
under Canadian federal or provincial Law as a result of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries being resident in Canada (or any province thereof) for Canadian
federal or provincial Tax purposes). If Parent, US Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent determine that any amounts are
required to be deducted or withheld (other than any deduction or withholding
with respect to any payments constituting compensation for services), Parent,
US Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to, prior to deducting or withholding any
such amounts, notify the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made and shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to establish
or obtain any exemption from or reduction in the amount of any withholding
that otherwise would be required; provided, however, that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent, US Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold (or cause to be deducted and withheld) any amounts at the time it is
required to so deduct and withhold under the Code or under any applicable
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.

11 Section 3.5 _Company SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) The Company has filed with or furnished to the SEC, on a timely basis, all
registration statements, reports, proxy statements and other documents that
the Company was required to file or furnish since January 1, 2015
(collectively, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto
and documents incorporated by reference therein, as such statements, reports
and documents may have been amended since the date of their filing, the "
_Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective effective dates (in the
case of Company SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant
to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective filing
dates (in the case of all other Company SEC Documents), or in the case of
amendments thereto, as of the date of the last such amendment (but only
amendments prior to the date of this Agreement in the case of any Company SEC
Document with a filing or effective date prior to the date of this Agreement),
the Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, applicable to such Company
SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents as of such respective
dates (or, if amended, the date of the filing of such amendment, with respect
to the disclosures that are amended) contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) Except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent Company SEC Document (but only updates, amendments, restatements or
corrections prior to the date of this Agreement in the case of any Company SEC
Document with a filing or effective date prior to the date of this
Agreement), as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, the
consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC
Documents (i) complied as to form in all material respects with
all applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), (ii) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except (A) as may be indicated in the notes thereto or (B) as permitted by
Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act) and (iii) present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows,

procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The
Companys disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure
that all material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. Based on its most recent evaluation of its internal control over
financial reporting prior to the date hereof, the Company has disclosed to its
auditors and its audit committee (A) all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect its ability to record, process, summarize and
report its consolidated financial information and (B) any known fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in its internal control over financial reporting.

 

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities which
would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes
thereto, except for liabilities (i) reflected or reserved against on the
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016
(the " _Balance Sheet Date_ ")

 



12  (including the notes thereto) included in the Company SEC Documents, (ii)
incurred after the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business,
(iii) as contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise arising in connection
with the Transactions or (iv) as would not reasonably be expected to have a

applicable Governmental Authority, and all such Regulatory Filings complied,
as of their respective dates, with all applicable requirements of the
applicable Laws, except, in each case, as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

are in compliance with all laws, statutes, ordinances, codes, rules,

Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
hold, and are in compliance with, all licenses, franchises,
permits, certificates, approvals, variances, orders, registrations and
authorizations from Governmental Authorities required by Law for the conduct
of their respective businesses as they are now being conducted (collectively,

as of the Balance Sheet Date that had not been accrued or reserved on such

18  representations or warranties contained in this _Article IV_ , or to one or
more of Parents, US Parents or Merger Subs covenants contained in _Article
V_ , except that any information set forth in one section of the Parent

concept exists) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent, US Parent and
Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by
the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of
Parent, US Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of them in

violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or
similar organizational documents of Parent, US Parent and Merger Sub, in each
case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement or (ii) assuming that each of
the consents, authorizations and approvals referred to in _Section_ __ _

and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent, US Parent and Merger Sub are making
their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,

memorandum, management presentation or projections) on behalf of the Company,
other than the representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article
III_ (it being understood that Parent, US Parent, Merger Sub and any Affiliate
of Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub have only relied on such express
representations and warranties). Each of Parent, US Parent and Merger Sub, on

Section 5.2 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, but in any event within sixty (60) days, the Company shall prepare
and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement, and Parent shall
cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the foregoing. The Company,
with Parents cooperation, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to and resolve all comments
received from the SEC or its staff concerning the Proxy Statement. The Company
agrees that (i) except with respect to any information supplied in writing to
the Company by Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Proxy Statement, the Proxy Statement will comply in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) none of the information supplied or
to be supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement will, on the date it is first mailed to shareholders of
the Company and at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Company will cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the Companys shareholders, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. No filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence with the SEC with
respect to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without providing
Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to a Takeover
Proposal, a Superior Proposal, a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any
matters relating thereto. Each of Parent, US Parent and Merger Sub shall
cooperate with the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of
the Proxy Statement,

 



25  including promptly furnishing to the Company in writing upon request any and
all information relating to it as may be required to be set forth in the Proxy
Statement under applicable Law. Each of the Parent, US Parent and Merger Sub
agrees that such information supplied by it in writing for inclusion (or
incorporation by reference) in the Proxy Statement will not, on the date it is
first mailed to shareholders of the Company and at the time of the Company
Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. If, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, any information relating to Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, Parent (or US Parent or Merger Sub, as
the case may be) shall promptly notify the Company so that the Company may
file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information and, to the extent required by Law, disseminate such amendment or
supplement to the shareholders of the Company. If, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, any information relating to the Company or any of
its respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the
Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Company shall promptly notify Parent and the Company shall
file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information and, to the extent required by Law, disseminate such amendment or
supplement to the shareholders of the Company.

 

(b) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of
the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the Companys shareholders,
in accordance with applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents and the NYSE
rules, duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders to
consider the approval of this Agreement and the plan of merger set forth
herein and such other matters as may then be reasonably required (including
any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Company Shareholders Meeting_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be permitted to delay or
postpone convening the Company Shareholders Meeting (i) with the consent of
Parent, (ii) for the absence of a quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional
time for any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company has
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) is
necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure
to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys shareholders prior to the
Company Shareholders Meeting as necessary under applicable Law or (iv) to
allow additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval. Except if there has been a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and secure the
Company Shareholder Approval.

 

(c) Unless and until there has been a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the Company shall include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation; Change in Recommendation_.

(a) The Company agrees that it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
and its Subsidiaries respective directors, officers and employees to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other Representatives to,
immediately cease all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal. Except as
otherwise provided in this

 



26  Agreement, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries respective directors, officers and
employees not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any Takeover Proposal or the
making or consummation thereof or (ii) enter into, or otherwise participate in
any discussions (except to notify such Person of the existence of the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_) or negotiations regarding, or furnish
to any Person any material non-public information in connection with, any
Takeover Proposal.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective
Representatives, receives an unsolicited written Takeover Proposal made after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, the Company, the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) and the Companys Representatives may engage in negotiations and
discussions with, or furnish any information and other access to, any Person
making such Takeover Proposal and any of its Representatives or potential
sources of financing if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors, that
such Takeover Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and that failure to take such actions would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ that prior to engaging in any negotiations or discussions with, or
furnishing any material non-public information to, any such Person or its
Representatives, the Company and the Person making such Takeover Proposal
shall have entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. The Company
will promptly (and in any event within the later of twenty-four (24) hours
and 5:00 p.m. Pacific time on the next Business Day) notify Parent in writing
of the receipt of such Takeover Proposal and the material terms and conditions
of such Takeover Proposal, including the identity of the Person making such
Takeover Proposal. The Company will keep Parent promptly informed in all
material respects (and in any event within the later of twenty-four (24) hours
and 5:00 p.m. Pacific time on the next Business Day) of material
communications relating to such Takeover Proposal (including any change in the
price or other material terms thereof). The Company shall not terminate,
amend, modify, waive or fail to enforce any provision of any "standstill" or
similar obligation of any Person unless the Company Board (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to withdraw, change,
qualify, withhold or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board
Recommendation, (B) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt,
approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal, (C) fail to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (D) in the event a tender
offer that constitutes a Takeover Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the
Exchange Act is commenced, fail to recommend against such Takeover Proposal in
any solicitation or recommendation statement made on Schedule 14D-9 within
ten (10) Business Days after Parent so requests reaffirmation in writing (
_provided_ that Parent shall be entitled to make such a written request for
reaffirmation only once for each Takeover Proposal and once for each material
amendment to such Takeover Proposal) (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to herein as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or
(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, agreement or commitment (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) constituting, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Takeover Proposal (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 



27 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

 

(i) at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, if the
Company has received a Superior Proposal other than as a result of a breach
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ (other than an immaterial breach), the Company
Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and, solely with respect to a Superior Proposal,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(ii)_, if (A) the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the receipt of
such Superior Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (B) (1) the Company provides
Parent prior written notice of its intent to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1(d)(ii)_ at least four (4) Business Days prior to taking such action to
the effect that, absent any modification to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Company Board has resolved to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 7.1(d)(ii)_, which notice shall specify the basis for such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change and attach the most current draft of any Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal (or, if no such
draft exists, a written summary of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal) (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal Recommendation Change_ ")
(it being understood that such Notice of Superior Proposal
Recommendation Change shall not in itself be deemed a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and that any change in price or material revision or
amendment to the terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice to
which the provisions of clauses (B)(1), (2) and (3) of this _Section_ __ _
5.3(d)(i)_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ except that, in the case of such a
new notice, all references to four (4) Business Days in this _Section_ __ _
5.3(d)(i)_ shall be deemed to be three (3) Business Days); (2) during such
four (4) Business Day period following Parents receipt of the Notice of
Superior Proposal Recommendation Change, if requested by Parent, the Company
shall make its Representatives reasonably available to negotiate in good
faith with Parent and its Representatives regarding any modifications to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement that Parent proposes to make; and (3)
at the end of such four (4) Business Day period and taking into account any
modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company
in a written, binding and irrevocable offer, the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure
to make such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
that such Takeover Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal; and

(ii) at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the occurrence of a Company
Intervening Event if (A) the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as a
result of the occurrence of such Company Intervening Event would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law
and (B) (1) the Company provides Parent prior written notice of its intent to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change at least four (4) Business Days
prior to taking such action to the effect that, absent any modification to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board has resolved to
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, which notice shall describe in
reasonable detail the Company Intervening Event that is the basis for
such Company Adverse Recommendation Change (a " _Notice of Intervening Event
Recommendation_

 



28   _Change_ ") (it being understood that such Notice of Intervening Event
Recommendation Change shall not in itself be deemed a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change); (2) during such four (4) Business Day period
following Parents receipt of the Notice of Intervening Event Recommendation
Change, if requested by Parent, the Company shall make its Representatives
reasonably available to negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives regarding any modifications to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement that Parent proposes to make; and (3) at the end of such four
(4) Business Day period and taking into account any modifications to the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company in a written, binding and
irrevocable offer, the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) from (i) taking and
disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (ii)
making any disclosure to the shareholders of the Company if the Company Board
(or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make
such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable
Law, (iii) informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained
in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ or (iv) making any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the shareholders of
the Company). No disclosures under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_ shall be, in
themselves, a breach of _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ or a basis for Parent to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_.

 

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any _bona
fide_ inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent, US
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates) to purchase or
otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or series
of related transactions, (i) assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries) that account for 15% or
more of the Companys consolidated assets or from which 15% or more of the
Companys revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are derived or (ii) 15%
or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock pursuant to a merger,
consolidation or other business combination, sale or issuance of shares of
capital stock, tender offer, share exchange, recapitalization or similar
transaction involving the Company, in each case other than the Merger;

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any
unsolicited written Takeover Proposal on terms which the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and independent
financial advisors, to be more favorable to the holders of Company Common
Stock than the Transactions (as may be revised pursuant to _Section_ __ _
5.3(d)(i)_), taking into account, to the extent applicable, the legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and this Agreement
that the Company Board considers relevant, including the prospects for receipt
of any required regulatory approvals and taking into account the agreements
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_,  _Section_ __ _ 1.7_ and _Exhibit B_
attached hereto with respect to the Transactions; _provided_ that for purposes
of the definition of Superior Proposal, the references to "15%" in the
definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

 



29 Section 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Company, Parent, US Parent and Merger Sub shall use its respective reasonable

Federal Trade Commission Act, and all applicable foreign Antitrust Laws and
all other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that are
designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition through merger or acquisition.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing: (i) each party

Transactions.

 



30 (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, but subject to the
other terms and conditions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, Parent, US Parent
and Merger Sub agree to take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid,
eliminate or resolve each and every impediment and obtain all clearances,
consents, approvals and waivers under Antitrust Laws or other applicable Laws
that may be required by any Governmental Authority (including any Regulatory
Approvals), so as to enable the parties to close the Transactions as soon as
practicable (and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the End Date), including committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate orders, trust, or otherwise, (i) the sale, license, holding separate
or other disposition of assets or businesses of Parent or the Company or any

respective Subsidiaries (each a " _Remedial Action_ ");  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any Remedial Action may, at the discretion of the Company or
Parent, be conditioned upon consummation of the Transactions.

 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, but subject to the
other terms and conditions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, in the event that
any litigation or other administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
commenced, threatened or is reasonably foreseeable challenging any of the
Transactions and such litigation, action or proceeding seeks, or would
reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent, materially impede or materially
delay the consummation of the Transactions, Parent shall take or cause to be
taken any and all action, including a Remedial Action, to avoid or resolve

the Transactions as promptly as practicable and in any event no later than
three (3) Business Days prior to the End Date.

(f) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the date
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VII_ , neither Parent, US
Parent nor Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit their respective
Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets, business,
Person or division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint
venture, collaboration or otherwise), if such acquisition would reasonably be
expected to materially increase the risk of not obtaining any applicable
clearance, consent, approval or waiver under Antitrust Laws or other
applicable Laws (including any Regulatory Approvals) with respect to the
Transactions, or would reasonably be expected to prevent or prohibit, or
materially impede, interfere with or delay, obtaining any applicable
clearance, consent, approval or waiver under Antitrust Laws or other
applicable Laws (including any Regulatory Approvals) with respect to the
Transactions.

(g) Notwithstanding the obligations set forth in this Agreement, Parent and
its Affiliates shall not be required to, in connection with obtaining any
actions or non-actions, clearances, approvals, consents, waivers,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any
Governmental Authority (including the Regulatory Approvals) in connection with
this Agreement or the Transactions, offer or accept, or agree, commit to agree
or consent to, any undertaking, term, condition, liability, obligation,
commitment or sanction (including any Remedial Action), that constitutes a

 



31  Burdensome Condition. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, in connection with obtaining any actions or non-
actions, clearances, approvals, consents, waivers, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental Authority
(including the Regulatory Approvals) in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions, (x) offer to agree to any undertaking, term, condition,
liability, obligation, commitment or sanction (including any Remedial Action)
that would reasonably be expected to be material and adverse to Parents
ability to obtain the Regulatory Approvals on substantially the terms that
Parent reasonably expects, or (y) accept, or agree, commit to agree or consent
to, any undertaking, term, condition, liability, obligation, commitment or
sanction (including any Remedial Action); _provided_ ,  _however_ , the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall take any Remedial Action requested by
Parent if such Remedial Action is conditioned upon the consummation of the
Transactions, it being understood that the foregoing limitations on the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not in any manner impact the obligations
of Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_.

 

(h) Parent shall promptly notify the Company and the Company shall notify
Parent of any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
alleging that such Governmental Authoritys consent is or may be required in
connection with or as a condition of the Merger.

 

Section 5.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Following such initial press
release, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing,
and shall give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release or other public statement with respect to the Transactions (to
the extent it contains information that is different than what is contained in
the initial press release) and shall not issue any such press release or make
any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party
may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with, or requirement of, any
applicable securities exchange or securities quotation system (which shall
include the NYSE in the case of the Company and the TSX in the case of Parent
in respect of the obligations of Parent to such exchange) (and then only after
as much advance notice and consultation as is feasible); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ shall
not apply to any release or public statement (a) made or proposed to be made
by the Company in connection with a Takeover Proposal, a Superior Proposal or
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant thereto,
(b) in connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this
Agreement or the Transactions or (c) that is not inconsistent in any material
respects with any prior public disclosures regarding the Transactions.

Section 5.6  _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, from
the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date on which
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, the Company
shall afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access (at Parents
sole cost and expense) during normal business hours and upon reasonable
advance notice to the Companys properties (but excluding for the conduct of
Phase II environmental assessments or testing), employees, books, Contracts
and records and the Company shall furnish as promptly as reasonably
practicable to Parent such information concerning its business, properties,
contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company as Parent may reasonably
request (other than any publicly available document filed by the Company and
its Subsidiaries pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities
Laws); _provided_ that Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such
activities in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or Company Joint
Ventures; _provided_ , _further_ , (i) that the Company shall not be obligated
to provide such access or information if the Company determines, in
its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate

 



32  applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a
third party, jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client privilege, or
expose such party to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or
personal information and (ii) the conduct of such activities shall be subject
to the rights and obligations of the Company referred to in the final proviso
of the final sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(c)_ hereof. Until the Effective
Time, the information provided will be subject to the terms of the
confidentiality agreement, dated as of May 31, 2017 between Parent and the
Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
and Company shall not, and Parent and Company shall cause their respective
Representatives not to, use such information for any purpose unrelated to the
consummation of the Transactions.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically be deemed to be amended and
restated such that (i) the "Standstill Period" for all purposes of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be the period of eighteen (18) months from
the date of such termination, as if the parties hereto had never entered into
this Agreement, and (ii) the other provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
shall remain in force and effect for a period of two (2) years after such
termination, as if the parties hereto had never entered into this Agreement.

Section 5.7 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Statute becomes applicable to
the Transactions, the Company and the Company Board will use its reasonable
best efforts to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Transactions.

 

Section 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
current and former director, officer and employee of the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service
was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_
") against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation
(whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative) (each, a " _Claim_
"), whenever asserted, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any
action or omission relating to their position with the Company or its
Subsidiaries occurring or alleged to have occurred before or at the Effective
Time (including any Claim relating in whole or in part to this Agreement or
the Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and
(ii) assume all obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Indemnitees in respect of limitation of liability, exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses as provided in (A) the Company
Charter Documents and the respective organizational documents of each of the
Companys Subsidiaries as currently in effect and (B) any indemnification
agreements with an Indemnitee (but only to the extent such indemnification
agreement was made available to Parent prior to the date hereof or entered
into after the date hereof in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 5.1(a)_), which
shall in each case survive the Transactions and continue in full force and
effect to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Without limiting the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to include provisions
for limitation of liabilities of directors and officers, indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of the Indemnitees no less favorable
to the Indemnitees than as set forth in the Company Charter Documents in
effect on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the Indemnitees except as required by applicable Law.

 



33 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay and advance to an Indemnitee any expenses
(including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any Claim
relating to any acts or omissions covered under this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ or
the enforcement of an Indemnitees rights under this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ as
and when incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
_provided_ that the Indemnitee to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification for such matter (but only to the extent such repayment is
required by applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents, the applicable
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company or applicable
indemnification agreements).

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect coverage no less favorable than the coverage
provided by the policies of directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance in effect as of the date hereof maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before
the Effective Time either through the Companys existing insurance provider or
another provider reasonably selected by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, after the Effective Time, none of Parent, US Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the
annual premium currently paid by the Company in respect of the coverages
required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as
much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, the Company may
purchase "tail" insurance coverage, at a cost no greater than the aggregate
amount which Parent, US Parent or the Surviving Corporation would be required
to spend during the sixyear period provided for in this _Section_ __ _
5.8(c)_, that provides coverage no less favorable than the coverage described
above to the insured persons than the directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof with respect to matters
arising on or before the Effective Time.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives from and after the Effective Time, and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for or limitation of, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise. The obligations of Parent, US Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this
_Section_ __ _ 5.8_ applies unless (A) such termination or modification is
required by applicable Law or (B) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented
in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed
that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_).

 

(e) In the event that Parent, US Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent, US Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of
the obligations thereof set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_.

 



34 Section 5.9 Transaction Litigation. Each of Parent and the Company shall
notify the other promptly of the commencement of any shareholder litigation
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions of which it has received notice
(" _Transaction Litigation_ "), and provide the other copies of any complaints
and pleadings filed in connection therewith (to the extent the other is not a
named party thereto). The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in, but not control, and shall reasonably consult with Parent with
respect to, the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation, and no
settlement of any Transaction Litigation shall be agreed to by the Company
without Parents prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

Section 5.10 _Section 16_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company,
Parent, US Parent and Merger Sub shall take all such steps reasonably
necessary to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) directly resulting
from the Merger by each individual who will be subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

Section 5.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of three (3) years following the Effective Time (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent or its Subsidiaries shall provide, or shall
cause to be provided, to each individual who is employed by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries)
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Employee_ "),
annual base salary or hourly rate, as applicable, annual cash bonus and long-
term incentive compensation opportunities (including target bonus amounts that
are payable subject to the satisfaction of performance criteria in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time) and employee benefits, in each case,
that are no less favorable than such annual base salary and base wages, annual
cash bonus and long-term incentive compensation opportunities and employee
benefits provided to such Company Employee, in the aggregate, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, for the period of time during the Continuation
Period in which each such Continuing Employee is employed by the Company or an
Affiliate of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to
equity based long-term incentive compensation, Parent or its Subsidiaries may
provide equity based long-term incentive compensation to the Company Employees
in accordance with (and in a manner no less favorable than) its incentive
objectives with respect to Parents and its Subsidiaries employees, and any
such equity based long-term incentive compensation shall be included in
determining whether the long-term incentive compensation opportunities set
forth above have been provided as required.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility
to participate and level of benefits but not for purposes of defined benefit
pension accrual) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee after the Effective
Time (including the Company Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any Company Plan which is
analogous to a New Plan and in which such Company Employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_
that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. Furthermore, to the extent a Company Employee or a "Company Retired
Employee" (as defined below) becomes eligible to participate in Parents or
its Subsidiaries retiree medical plan, for all purposes (including purposes
of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under
the retiree medical plan of Parent and its Subsidiaries, each (i) Company
Employee and (ii) former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
whose employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ended as a result
of such former employees retirement and who is eligible to participate in
the Companys retiree medical plan as of the Effective Time (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, will include any such individuals who waived participation
in such retiree medical 

 



35  plan but are still eligible, pursuant to the terms of such retiree medical
plan as in effect on the date hereof, to participate in such plan) (the "
_Company Retired Employees_ "), shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Employee or Company Retired Employee was entitled, immediately before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under the Companys retiree medical
plan as of the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to,
provide postretirement medical benefits (including the employer
contribution toward the cost of such postretirement medical benefits) to
Eligible Retirees (as defined below) that (A) during the Continuation Period
are no less favorable than those provided under the Companys postretirement
medical program in effect as of the date of the Agreement (the " _Company
Retiree Health Plan_ ") and (B) following the Continuation Period are no less
favorable than those provided to similarly situated, as applicable, employees
and retirees who participate in the post-retirement programs of Parent or its
Subsidiaries (other than the Surviving Corporation). " _Eligible Retirees_ "
means Company Retired Employees and Company Employees who are or become
eligible to participate in the Company Retiree Health Plan as in effect on
January 1, 2016 during or after the Continuation Period. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (1) Parent shall, or cause
an Affiliate to, cause each Company Employee to be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Company
Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (2) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause (or, in the case
of a New Plan that is insured by a third party insurance company, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such insurance company to cause) all
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under
the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such
Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent
shall, or cause an Affiliate to, cause (or, in the case of a New Plan that is
insured by a third party insurance company, shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such insurance company to cause) any eligible expenses
incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Company
Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such analogous New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 5.11(a)_, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to assume, honor, and continue all obligations under the
Company Plans and compensation and severance arrangements and agreements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time (including the Executive Change of Control Agreements), and the
Transactions shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control," "change of
control," "corporate transaction" or similar words to such effect under all
such Company Plans, arrangements or agreements.

(d) To the extent that the Effective Time occurs (i) in 2018 or (ii)
following the end of the 2018 performance period with respect to the Companys
Annual Incentive Plans or any other applicable annual bonus plan, but, in each
case, prior to payment of the bonuses for such 2018 performance period,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each Company Employee
the bonus to which the Company Employee would be entitled for such 2018
performance period based on actual performance, with such payment to occur no
later than March 15, 2019, consistent with past practice. In addition, in the
event that the Effective Time occurs in 2019, Parent shall cause the Surviving

 



36  Corporation to pay to each Company Employee any bonus that such Company
Employee would be entitled to receive under the Companys Annual Incentive
Plans and any other applicable annual bonus plan for the 2019 performance
period based on such Company Employees actual performance for such 2019
performance period, with such payment to occur no later than March 15, 2020,
consistent with past practice.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_,
with respect to all employment terms and conditions affecting Company
Employees covered by a CBA, as applicable, Parent shall or shall cause US
Parent to: (1) assume any liabilities or obligations contained in the CBAs;
and (2) provide, or shall cause to be provided, to such Company Employees
terms and conditions of employment, including all compensation and benefits,
as required by the applicable CBAs.

(f) Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to implement the executive retention program for the executives
listed on _Section_ __ _ 5.11(f)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule on the
terms set forth therein.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.11_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement, and no provision of this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ is intended to, or
shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any
Company Plans, and no Company Employee or any other individual associated
therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of
this Agreement or have the right to enforce the provisions hereof including in
respect of continued employment (or resumed employment). Nothing contained
herein shall alter the at-will employment relationship of any Company
Employee.

 

Section 5.12 _Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation_.

 

(a) Parent and US Parent shall take or cause to be taken all actions necessary
to (i) cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform promptly
their respective obligations under this Agreement and (ii) cause Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.
Prior to the Effective Time, US Parent and Merger Sub shall not engage in any
activity of any nature except for activities related to or in furtherance of
the Transactions or the Restructuring.

(b) In the event that Parent, US Parent and Merger Sub determine to effect
the Restructuring, the Company agrees to provide reasonable cooperation to
Parent, US Parent and Merger Sub, upon request, in connection with the
implementation of the Restructuring; _provided_ that any obligation to
cooperate shall be limited to the same extent provided under _Section_ __ _
5.15(b)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the failure to
comply with this  _Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_ give rise to a failure of the
condition in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_ to be satisfied.

 

(c) Parent shall (i) promptly reimburse the Company for all reasonable
and out-of-pocket costs or expenses (including reasonable and documented
costs and expenses of counsel and accountants) incurred by the Company, the
Subsidiaries of the Company and any of its or their Representatives in
connection with any cooperation provided for in _Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_, and
(ii) indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company
and any of its and their Representatives against any claim, loss, damage,
injury, liability, judgment, award, penalty, fine, cost (including cost of
investigation), expense (including fees and expenses of counsel and
accountants) or settlement payment incurred as a result of, or in connection
with, any cooperation provided for in _Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_ and any
information used in connection therewith, unless the Company acted in bad
faith or with gross negligence and other than in the case of fraud

 



37 (d) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall adopt the instrument set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, with
regard to the matters set forth in _Exhibit A_ and _Exhibit B_.

in this Agreement is intended to give Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or its
Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its
Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

Section 5.14 _Advice of Changes_. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, each of Parent, US Parent and the Company will, to
the extent not in violation of any applicable Law, promptly notify the other
of (a) any circumstance, development, change, event, occurrence or effect of
which it has Knowledge that has had or that would reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect, as
the case may be, or (b) any material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to a failure of any condition to the obligations of the
other party or parties to effect the Merger set forth in _Article VI_ to be
satisfied, provided that (i) no such notification will affect
the representations, warranties or covenants of the parties or the conditions
to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement and (ii) in no event
shall the failure to comply with this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ give rise to
a failure of any condition set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied.

shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to,

involved in any such financing to complete customary pre-closing due
diligence on the Company and its Subsidiaries as is customary for transactions
of a similar nature.

 



38 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this  _Section_ __
_ 5.15_, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_ shall require any such
cooperation to the extent that it would (i) require the Company to pay any

its Subsidiaries from delivering its year-end audited financial statements or
quarterly unaudited financial statements to the extent Parent or any of its
Affiliates is required by applicable Canadian securities laws to provide
financial statement disclosure of the Company or its Subsidiaries) or (3) any

such Regulatory Approvals shall have become Final Orders.

 



39 (c) _No Injunctions_. No Law enacted, promulgated, issued, entered, amended or
enforced by any Governmental Authority shall be in effect enjoining,
restraining, preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger or making
the consummation of the Merger illegal.

ARTICLE VII

 

 _TERMINATION_

 

Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent; or

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent:

 

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before September 30,
2018 (the " _End Date_ ");  _provided_ that if, prior to the End Date, all of
the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VI_ have been satisfied or
waived, as applicable, or shall then be capable of being satisfied (except for
any condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c),_
or _Section_ __ _ 6.2(e))_, either the Company or Parent may, prior to 5:00
p.m. Pacific time on the End Date, extend the End Date to a date that is not
later than six (6) months after the End Date (and if so extended, such later
date shall then, for all purposes under this Agreement, be the " _End Date_
"); _provided_ , _further_ , that neither the Company nor Parent may
terminate this Agreement or extend the End Date pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 7.1(b)(i)_ if it (or, in the case of Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub) is in
breach of this Agreement and such breach has primarily caused or resulted in
either (1) the failure to satisfy the conditions to its obligations to
consummate the Closing set forth in _Article VI_ prior to the End Date or (2)
the failure of the Closing to have occurred by the End Date; or

 

(ii) if any Law having the effect set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_ shall
not have been reversed, stayed, enjoined, set aside, annulled or suspended
and shall be in full force and effect and, in the case of any Judgment (each,
a " _Restraint_ "), shall have become final and non-appealable;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_
_7.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to the Company or Parent if the issuance
of such final, non-appealable Restraint was primarily due to a breach by such
party of any of its covenants or agreements under this Agreement, including
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.4; or_

 



41 (iii) if the Company Shareholder Approval contemplated by this Agreement
shall not have been obtained at the Company Shareholders Meeting duly
convened (including any adjournments or postponements thereof); or

(c) by Parent:

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _
6.2(b)_, respectively, and (B) cannot be cured by the Company by the End Date
or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30)
calendar days following receipt of written notice from Parent stating Parents
intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.1(c)(i)_ and the basis for such termination; _provided_ that Parent shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.1(c)(i)_ if Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of
this Agreement; or

(ii) if the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) shall have
effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(ii)_ if the Company Shareholder Approval shall have
been obtained; or

(d) by the Company:

 

(i) if Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_, respectively, and (B) cannot be cured by Parent, US
Parent or Merger Sub by the End Date or, if capable of being cured, shall not
have been cured within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of written
notice from the Company stating the Companys intention to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(i)_ and the basis for such
termination; _provided_ that, the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(i)_ if the
Company is then in material breach of this Agreement; or

(ii) prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, if the Company
Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) shall have effected a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Superior Proposal in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and shall have approved, and
substantially concurrently with the termination hereunder, the Company shall
have entered into, a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal;  _provided_ that such termination pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(ii)_ shall not be effective and the Company shall not
enter into any such Company Acquisition Agreement, unless the Company has paid
the Company Termination Fee to Parent or causes the Company Termination Fee
to be paid to Parent substantially concurrently with such termination in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.3_; ( _provided_ that Parent shall have
provided wiring instructions for such payment or, if not, then such payment
shall be paid promptly following delivery of such instructions).

 



42 Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, written notice thereof
shall be given to the other party or parties hereto, specifying the provision
hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement
shall forthwith become null and void and have no further force or effect
(other than _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_, this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, _Section_ __ _
7.3 _and _Article VIII_ , all of which shall survive termination of this
Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, US Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company or their respective directors, officers, other
Representatives or Affiliates, whether arising before or after
such termination, based on, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the negotiation, execution, performance or subject matter hereof (whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law
or by statute) or in equity); _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_ (including the limitations on liability contained
therein), no party hereto shall be relieved or released from any liabilities
or damages arising out of any willful and material breach of this Agreement
prior to such termination that gave rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in _Article VI_. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive in
accordance with its terms following termination of this Agreement (as
modified pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_). Without limiting the meaning of
a willful and material breach, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
any failure by a party hereto to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby after the applicable conditions to the
Closing set forth in _Article VI_ have been satisfied or waived (except for
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
which conditions would be capable of being satisfied at the time of such
failure to consummate the Merger) shall constitute a willful and material
breach of this Agreement.

 

Section 7.3 _Termination Fee_ _s_.

 

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(ii)_, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid as
directed by Parent the Company Termination Fee substantially concurrently with

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(ii)_, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid as

(c) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(iii)_
or (B) by Parent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(i)_ (solely with respect
to a breach or failure to perform a covenant), (ii) a Takeover Proposal shall
have been publicly disclosed or made to the Company after the date hereof and
not publicly withdrawn (x) in the case of termination pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 7.1(b)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(i)_, prior to the date of such
termination, or (y) in the case of termination pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
7.1(b)(iii)_, prior to the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting, and (iii)
within twelve (12) months of the date this Agreement is terminated, the
Company enters into a Company Acquisition Agreement or consummates a Takeover
Proposal ( _provided_ that for purposes of clause (iii) of this _Section_ __ _
7.3(c)_, the references to "15%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall
be deemed to be references to "50%"), then the Company shall pay or cause to
be paid as directed by Parent the Company Termination Fee on the earlier of
the date of entry into such Company Acquisition Agreement and the date of
consummation of such transaction.

 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company_ _Termination Fee_ " shall mean
an amount equal to $103,000,000.

 

(e) Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company a fee of $103,000,000
in cash (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") if:

 



43 (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company:

 

(A) pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(i)_ and, at the time of such
termination, any of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_ (in the case of _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_, if and only
if the applicable Restraint giving rise to such termination arises in
connection with the Regulatory Approvals), shall have not been satisfied; or

(B) pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(ii)_ (if, and only if, the applicable
Restraint giving rise to such termination arises in connection with the
Regulatory Approvals); or

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1(d)(i)_ because of a failure by Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub to comply
with their obligations under _Section_ __ _ 5.4_;

_provided_ that, at the time of any such termination described in clause (i)
or (ii) of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(e)_, the conditions to the Closing set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ (other than
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.2(e)_) shall have been satisfied
or waived (except for any such conditions that have not been satisfied as a
result of a breach by Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub of its respective
obligations under this Agreement).

Parent shall pay or cause to be paid the Parent Termination Fee to the Company
(to an account designated in writing by the Company) no later than two (2)
Business Days after the date of the applicable termination.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company be required
to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that if
this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which the Company is
obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee under this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_
and the Company Termination Fee is paid, the payment of the Company
Termination Fee and any costs, expenses and interest pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 7.3(h)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent, US
Parent and Merger Sub with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions,
and, upon payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 7.3_ and any costs, expenses and interest pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.3(h)_, the Company (and the Companys Affiliates and its and their
respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders and other
Representatives) shall have no further liability with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions to Parent, US Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives. In no event shall Parent be
required to pay or cause to be paid the Parent Termination Fee on more than
one occasion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
parties hereto agree that if this Agreement is terminated under
circumstances in which Parent is obligated to pay or cause to be paid the
Parent Termination Fee under this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ and the Parent
Termination Fee is paid, the payment of the Parent Termination Fee and any
costs, expenses and interest pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(h) _shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy available to the Company with respect to this
Agreement and the Transactions, and, upon payment of the Parent Termination
Fee pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3 and _any costs, expenses and
interest pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(h)_, Parent, US Parent and Merger Sub
(and their Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees,
shareholders and other Representatives) shall have no further liability with
respect to this Agreement or the Transactions to the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives.

 



44 (g) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ shall
be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Parent or the Company, as applicable, and shall be reduced by
any amounts required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Law
in respect of Taxes.

 

(h) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ are integral parts of the Transactions
and that, without these agreements, Parent, US Parent and Merger Sub, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, would not enter into this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereto further acknowledges and agrees that
payment of the Company Termination Fee and Parent Termination Fee, as
applicable, if, as and when required pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_,
shall not constitute a penalty but rather will constitute liquidated damages,
in a reasonable amount that will compensate the party hereto receiving such
amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision. Accordingly, (i) if Parent fails to pay the Parent Termination
Fee pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(e)_ when due, and, in order to obtain
such payment, the Company commences a Claim that results in a judgment against
Parent for the Parent Termination Fee, Parent shall pay to the Company,
together with the Parent Termination Fee, the Companys costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such Claim, and
interest on the Parent Termination Fee from the date such payment was required
to be made until the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the Prime
Rate in effect on the date such payment was required to be made, or (ii) if
the Company fails to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 7.3(a)_,  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c_) when due,
and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Claim that results in
a judgment against the Company for the Company Termination Fee, the
Company shall pay to Parent, together with the Company Termination Fee,
Parents costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in
connection with such Claim, and interest on the Company Termination Fee from
the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at a
rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.

for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any other party
hereto or (c) waive compliance by any other party hereto with any of the
agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any
of such partys conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay
by the Company, Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 

Section 8.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,

facsimile or otherwise) to the other parties hereto.

Section 8.7 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
including the Company Disclosure Schedule, and any exhibits hereto, together
with the other instruments referred to herein, including the Confidentiality
Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or
any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and (b) is
not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, except for (i) the rights of the
Companys shareholders and holders of RSUs and Performance Awards to receive
the Merger Consideration and payments pursuant to _Article II_
, respectively, (ii) the right of the Company, on behalf of its shareholders,
to pursue damages in the event of Parent, US Parent or Merger Subs willful
and material breach of this Agreement, in which event the damages recoverable
by the Company for itself and on behalf of its shareholders (without
duplication) shall be determined by reference to the total amount that would
have been recoverable by the holders of the Company Common Stock (including
"lost premium" and time value of money) if all such holders brought an action
against Parent, US Parent and Merger Sub and were recognized as intended third
party beneficiaries hereunder, which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed
by Parent, US Parent and Merger Sub and (iii) the provisions of _Section_ __
_ 5.8_.

Section 8.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware, except that matters related to
the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board and matters that are
specifically required by the WBCA in connection with the Transactions shall be
governed by the laws of the State of Washington.

 



46 (b) Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably submits itself to the personal
jurisdiction of each state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware,
as well as to the jurisdiction of all courts to which an appeal may be taken
from such courts, in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein, (ii) agrees
that every such suit, action or proceeding shall be brought, heard and
determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (
_provided_ that, in the event subject matter jurisdiction is unavailable in
or declined by the Court of Chancery, then all such claims shall be brought,
heard and determined exclusively in any other state or federal court sitting
in the State of Delaware), (iii) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
such court, (iv) agrees not to bring any suit, action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any other
court, and (v) waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
any suit, action or proceeding so brought.

(c) Each party hereto irrevocably consents to the service of process outside
the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this _Section_ __ _
8.8_ in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof
by registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return
receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to this _Article
VIII_. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a party hereto to
effect service of process on any other party hereto by any other legally
available method.

Section 8.9 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that immediate,
extensive and irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages would
not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are
otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that, if for any
reason Parent, US Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall have failed to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or otherwise breached this
Agreement, then the party hereto seeking to enforce this Agreement against
such nonperforming party under this Agreement shall be entitled to specific
performance and the issuance of immediate injunctive and other equitable
relief without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a
remedy, and the parties hereto further agree to waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such
injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in addition to and not in
limitation of any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.
If any party hereto brings any Claim to enforce specifically the performance
of the terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly available to
such party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the End Date shall automatically be extended
by the period of time between the commencement of such Claim and ten (10)
Business Days following the date on which such Claim is fully and finally
resolved.

Section 8.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
_SECTION_ __ _ 8.10_.
