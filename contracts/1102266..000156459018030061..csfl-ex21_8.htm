NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.01.The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Florida Business Corporation Act (the
"FBCA") and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), at the
Effective Time, NCC shall merge with and into CenterState pursuant to this
Agreement and the plan of merger, in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit

   

C and made a part hereof (the "Plan of Merger"). CenterState shall be the
Surviving Entity in the Merger and shall continue its existence as a
corporation under the laws of the State of Florida. As of the Effective Time,
the separate corporate existence of NCC shall cease.

 

Section 1.02.Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the
articles of incorporation of CenterState in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the "CenterState Articles") shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in accordance
with applicable Law. The bylaws of CenterState in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the "CenterState Bylaws") shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law
and the terms of such bylaws.

 

Section 1.03.Bank Merger. Except as provided below, immediately following the
Effective Time, sequentially, but in effect simultaneously, on the Closing
Date, National Bank of Commerce, a national banking association and a direct
wholly-owned subsidiary of NCC ("NBC"), shall be merged (the "Bank Merger")
with and into CenterState Bank, N.A., a national banking association and a
direct wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterState ("CenterState Bank"), in
accordance with the provisions of applicable federal banking laws and
regulations, and CenterState Bank shall be the surviving bank (the "Surviving
Bank"). The Bank Merger shall have the effects as set forth under applicable
federal banking laws and regulations, and the boards of directors of the
Parties shall cause the boards of directors of CenterState Bank and NBC,
respectively, to approve a separate plan of merger and merger agreement (the
"Bank Plan of Merger") in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit D,
and cause the Bank Plan of Merger to be executed and delivered as soon as
practicable following the date of execution of this Agreement. Each of
CenterState and NCC shall also approve the Bank Plan of Merger in their
capacities as sole shareholders of CenterState Bank and NBC, respectively. As
provided in the Bank Plan of Merger, the Bank Merger may be abandoned at the
election of CenterState Bank at any time, whether before or after filings are
made for regulatory approval of the Bank Merger unless such abandonment would
cause a material delay in the receipt of the Regulatory Approvals, but if the
Bank Merger is abandoned for any reason, NBC shall continue to operate as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterState.

 

Section 1.04.Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time, (a) the directors
of the Surviving Entity shall be as set forth in Section 5.16(a) until such
time as their successors are duly elected and qualified; and (b) the officers
of the Surviving Entity shall be as set forth in Section 5.16(b).

 

Section 1.05.Effective Time; Closing.

 

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parties will
make all such filings as may be required to consummate the Merger and the Bank
Merger under applicable Law. The Merger shall become effective as set forth
in the articles of merger related to the Merger, which will include the Plan
of Merger, that shall be filed with the Department of State of the State of
Florida, as provided in the FBCA (the "Articles of Merger"), and the
certificate of merger related to the Merger that shall be filed with the
Division of Corporations in the Department of State of the State of Delaware,
as provided in the DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger"), each on the Closing
Date. The "Effective Time" of the Merger shall be the later of (i) the latest
effective date and time of filing of the (A) Articles of Merger and (B)
Certificate of Merger, or (ii) the date and time when the Merger becomes
effective as set forth in the Articles of Merger and the Certificate of
Merger, which shall be no later than five (5) Business Days after all of the
conditions to the consummation of the Merger set forth in Article VI (other
than conditions to be satisfied at the Closing, which shall be satisfied or
waived at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the
terms hereof or such later date as the Parties may agree; provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree, if requested by CenterState,
that the Effective Time shall occur on the first day of the month that begins
after such fifth (5th) Business Day.

   

(b)The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall take place on a date and time which shall be at or
immediately prior to the Effective Time (such date, the "Closing Date") at the
offices of CenterState, or such other place as the Parties may mutually agree.
At or prior to the Closing, there shall be delivered by CenterState and NCC
the Articles of Merger, the Certificate of Merger and such other certificates
and other documents required to be delivered under Article VI, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 1.06.Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
CenterState shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, documents,
assignments or assurances in Law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, NCC and its Subsidiaries and
their respective officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to
CenterState and its Subsidiaries, and each or any of them, an irrevocable
power of attorney to execute and deliver, in such official corporate
capacities, all such deeds, assignments or assurances in Law or any other acts
as are necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and
the officers and directors of CenterState and its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
are authorized in the name of NCC and its Subsidiaries or otherwise to take
any and all such action.

 

Section 1.07.Reservation of Right to Revise Structure. CenterState may at any
time, with the consent of NCC (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), change the method of effecting the business
combination contemplated by this Agreement if and to the extent that it
reasonably deems such a change to be desirable; provided, however, that no
such change shall (a) alter or change the amount or kind of the consideration
to be issued to (i) Holders of NCC Common Stock as Merger Consideration or
(ii) holders of NCC Equity Awards or NCC Warrants, each as currently
contemplated in this Agreement, (b) reasonably be expected to materially
impede or delay consummation of the Merger, (c) adversely affect the federal
income tax treatment of Holders of NCC Common Stock in connection with the
Merger or adversely limit or impact the qualification of the Merger as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code, or (d)
require submission to or approval of NCC's stockholders after this Agreement
has been approved by NCC's stockholders. In the event that CenterState elects
to make such a change, the Parties agree to cooperate to execute appropriate
documents to reflect the change.

 

ARTICLE II 

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 

Section 2.01.Merger Consideration. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Parties or any stockholder of NCC:

 

(a)Each share of CenterState Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following the
Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

 

(b)Each share of NCC Common Stock owned directly by CenterState, NCC or any of
their respective Subsidiaries (other than shares in trust accounts, managed
accounts and the like for the benefit of customers or shares held as
collateral for outstanding debt previously contracted) immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time
without any conversion thereof, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto.

 

(c)Each share of NCC Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares described in Section 2.01(b)), shall be
converted, in accordance with the

   

procedures set forth in this Article II, into the right to receive 1.65 shares
(the "Exchange Ratio") of CenterState Common Stock (the "Merger
Consideration") (provided that cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares
as specified in Section 2.04).

 

Section 2.02.Stock-Based Awards.

 

(a)NCC Stock Options. Each valid option to purchase shares of NCC Common
Stock pursuant to the NCC Equity Plans (each an "NCC Stock Option"),
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, by
virtue of the Merger, be assumed by CenterState, and automatically and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into an option to
purchase that number of shares of CenterState Common Stock as shall equal the
product obtained by multiplying the Exchange Ratio by that number of shares of
NCC Common Stock which such NCC Stock Option entitled the holder thereof to
purchase (rounded to the nearest whole share), and at an exercise price equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of the NCC
Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest cent); provided,
however, that in the event that the Merger Consideration is modified as a
result of the application of Section 2.09, Section 7.01(i) or otherwise, then
the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted in order to reflect the
impact of such modification to the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the method of adjusting each NCC Stock Option that is intended to
be an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall
comply with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, and the method of adjusting all other NCC Stock
Options shall comply with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a modification of such NCC
Stock Option that would cause such NCC Stock Option to violate Section 409A of
the Code. Except with respect to the adjustment described above, each NCC
Stock Option shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms and
conditions. Where the context so requires, all references to NCC (or an
Affiliate or a predecessor of NCC) in the assumed NCC Equity Plans and the
applicable award agreements shall be deemed to be references to CenterState
and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and all references to the NCC board of
directors (or the Compensation Committee thereof) shall be deemed to be
references to the CenterState board of directors (or the Compensation
Committee thereof).

 

(b)NCC Warrants. Each outstanding and unexercised warrant to purchase NCC
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an "NCC Warrant")
shall, by virtue of the Merger, be assumed by CenterState, and automatically
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a
right to purchase shares of NCC Common Stock and shall be converted into a
right to purchase that number of shares of CenterState Common Stock as shall
equal the product obtained by multiplying the Exchange Ratio by that number of
shares of NCC Common Stock which such NCC Warrant entitled the holder thereof
to purchase (rounded to the nearest whole share), and at an exercise price
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of the
NCC Warrant by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest cent); provided,
however, that in the event that the Merger Consideration is modified as a
result of the application of Section 2.09, Section 7.01(i) or otherwise, then
the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted in order to reflect the
impact of such modification to the Merger Consideration. Except with respect
to the adjustment described above, each NCC Warrant shall remain in effect in
accordance with its terms and conditions. Where the context so requires, all
references to NCC (or an Affiliate or a predecessor of NCC) in the assumed
agreements representing the NCC Warrants shall be deemed to be references to
CenterState and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and all references to the NCC
board of directors (or the Compensation Committee thereof) shall be deemed to
be references to the CenterState board of directors (or the Compensation
Committee thereof).

   

(c)NCC Performance Share Awards.

 

(i)2015 Performance Share Awards. All outstanding performance share awards
with respect to shares of NCC Common Stock for the four-year performance
period ending on December 31, 2018 (the "2015 Performance Share Awards")
shall, in accordance with the applicable NCC Equity Plan and award agreements,
vest and be issued by NCC as soon as reasonably practicable after the
following dates: (A) for time-based awards, December 31, 2018, and (B) for
performance-based awards, the date of certification by the Compensation
Committee of the NCC board of directors and confirmation by Porter Keadle
Moore, LLC, NCC's independent public accountants, of the extent to which the
performance criteria underlying such awards have been achieved, in accordance
with the applicable award agreements, and in no event later than March 15,
2019. Such shares, to the extent that they become NCC Deferred Shares, shall
be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
2.02(d), and to the extent they are instead issued as shares of NCC Common
Stock and do not become NCC Deferred Shares, shall be included in the NCC
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 2.01(c). In the event that the Effective Time takes place prior to the
certification described above, such 2015 Performance Share Awards shall be
treated in a manner identical to the 2016-2018 Performance Share Awards, as
described below.

 

(ii)2016-2018 Performance Share Awards. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the outstanding performance share awards with respect to shares of NCC
Common Stock for the four-year performance periods ending on December 31,
2019, 2020 and 2021, all of which are to be measured over a performance period
that will not be completed prior to the Effective Time (the "2016-2018
Performance Share Awards"), shall vest as specified in the applicable award
agreements (it being understood that the determination of the number of
performance shares earned under the applicable award agreements, and the
extent to which the performance goals have been achieved for the partial
performance period, shall be conclusively determined, in good faith, by the
Compensation Committee of the NCC board of directors, in accordance with the
change in control provisions in the applicable NCC Equity Plans and award
agreements, as soon as reasonably practicable prior to the Closing, which
determination shall be final and binding on the Parties). Each of the
2016-2018 Performance Share Awards shall be cancelled at the Effective Time in
exchange for the right to receive, within ten (10) days following the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of NCC
Common Stock underlying such 2016-2018 Performance Share Awards as determined
pursuant to this Section 2.02(c)(ii), subject to applicable tax withholding.

 

(d)NCC Deferred Shares. At the Effective Time, the deferrals of NCC Common
Stock representing equity awards and director fees credited to participant
accounts under the National Commerce Corporation Deferral of Compensation Plan
for Key Employees and Non-Employee Directors (the "NCC Deferred Shares") shall
be converted into the right to receive, within ten (10) days following the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration in respect of each such NCC Deferred
Share, subject to applicable tax withholding.

 

(e)Additional Provisions.

 

(i)Prior to the Effective Time, the NCC board of directors (or the
Compensation Committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other commercially reasonable actions, including obtaining any necessary
consents or amendments to the applicable NCC Equity Plans and award
agreements, as may be required to effectuate the provisions of this Section
2.02.

   

(ii)As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, CenterState shall
file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate forms) with the SEC with respect to each of the NCC Equity Plans
assumed by CenterState and the shares of CenterState Common Stock subject to
the assumed NCC Stock Options that were originally granted under such NCC
Equity Plans. CenterState shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of each such registration statement (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses associated therewith) for so long as
such assumed NCC Stock Options remain outstanding.

 

Section 2.03.Rights as Stockholders; Stock Transfers. Prior to the Effective
Time, NCC shall continue to maintain its stock transfer records and to
transfer Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and replace Certificates in
accordance with its existing policies and past practices with regard to such
transfers and replacements. At the Effective Time, all shares of NCC Common
Stock, when converted in accordance with Section 2.01, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each Certificate or Book-Entry Share previously evidencing such
shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive for each such
share of NCC Common Stock, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock in accordance with this Article
II. At the Effective Time, Holders of NCC Common Stock shall cease to be, and
shall have no rights as, stockholders of NCC, other than the right to receive
the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of CenterState
Common Stock as provided under this Article II. After the Effective Time,
there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of NCC
of shares of NCC Common Stock.

 

Section 2.04.Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof,
no fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger. In lieu thereof, CenterState shall pay or cause to be paid to each
holder of a fractional share of CenterState Common Stock, rounded to the
nearest one hundredth of a share, an amount of cash (without interest and
rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying the fractional
share interest in CenterState Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled by the CenterState Average Stock Price.

 

Section 2.05.Plan of Reorganization. It is intended that the Merger shall
constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" as that
term is used in Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. 

 

Section 2.06.Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the
Closing Date, and provided that NCC has delivered, or caused to be delivered,
to the Exchange Agent all information that is reasonably necessary for the
Exchange Agent to perform its obligations as specified herein, the Exchange
Agent shall mail or otherwise cause to be delivered to each Holder appropriate
and customary transmittal materials, in a form reasonably satisfactory to
CenterState and NCC, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent, as well as instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
(and cash in lieu of fractional shares as specified in Section 2.04) (the
"Letter of Transmittal").

 

Section 2.07.Deposit of Merger Consideration.

 

(a)Prior to the Effective Time, CenterState shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) the number of shares of CenterState
Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.01(c), Section 2.02(c)(ii) and
Section 2.02(d) in book-entry form equal to the aggregate CenterState

   

Common Stock portion of the Merger Consideration (excluding any fractional
shares), and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to pay, to the extent then
determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.04 (collectively, the "Exchange Fund").

 

(b)Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders
of NCC for one (1) year after the Effective Time (as well as any interest or
proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent
to CenterState. Any stockholders of NCC who have not theretofore complied with
this Section 2.07 and Section 2.08(a) shall thereafter look only to
CenterState for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of CenterState Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor, and any dividends or distributions to which such Holder shall have
become entitled to pursuant to Section 2.08(b) deliverable in respect of each
share of NCC Common Stock such stockholder held as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without
any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
shares of NCC Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them is not
claimed prior to the date on which such shares of CenterState Common Stock or
cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental
unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by the law
of abandoned property and any other applicable Law, become the property of
CenterState (and to the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to
it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any Party shall be
liable to any Holder represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Share for
any Merger Consideration (or any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. CenterState and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to rely upon the stock transfer books of NCC to establish the identity of
those Persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this
Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event
of a dispute with respect to ownership of any shares of NCC Common Stock
represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Share, CenterState and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to tender to the custody of any court of
competent jurisdiction any Merger Consideration represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share and file legal proceedings interpleading all
parties to such dispute, and will thereafter be relieved with respect to any
claims thereto.

 

Section 2.08.Delivery of Merger Consideration.

 

(a)Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Share(s), accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a Holder
will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) book-
entry shares representing that number of whole shares of CenterState Common
Stock to which such Holder shall have become entitled pursuant to Section
2.01(c) (excluding any fractional share) and (ii) cash in an amount equal to
(A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock which
such Holder shall have become entitled pursuant to Section 2.04, and (B) any
dividends or distributions to which such Holder shall have become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.08(b). CenterState shall direct the Exchange Agent to
provide to each such Holder of NCC Common Stock (x) the applicable Merger
Consideration, (y) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of CenterState Common
Stock pursuant to Section 2.04, and (z) and any dividends or distributions to
which such Holder shall have become entitled to pursuant to Section 2.08(b)
promptly, which shall be no later than five (5) Business Days upon receipt of
a Holder's Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and a completed Letter of
Transmittal. The Exchange Agent and CenterState, as the case may be, shall not
be obligated to deliver cash and/or shares of CenterState Common Stock to a
Holder to which such Holder would otherwise be entitled as a result of the
Merger until such Holder surrenders the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
representing the shares of NCC Common Stock for exchange as provided in this
Article II, or, an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement
and/or a bond in such amount as may be reasonably required in each case by
CenterState or the Exchange Agent. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
a Certificate representing NCC Common Stock that is not registered in the
stock transfer records of NCC, the proper amount of the Merger Consideration
shall be paid or issued in exchange therefor to a Person

   

other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered if the Certificate formerly representing such NCC Common Stock
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other
similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a Person other
than the registered Holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction
of CenterState that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 

(b)All shares of CenterState Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger
shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and if ever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by CenterState in respect of the
CenterState Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares of CenterState Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of
the CenterState Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share until such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the
effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of CenterState Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of CenterState Common
Stock and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of CenterState
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment
date subsequent to surrender.

 

(c)CenterState (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Holder such amounts as CenterState is required to deduct and
withhold under applicable Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority and upon such remittance
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
CenterState or the Exchange Agent, as applicable.

 

Section 2.09.Anti-Dilution Provisions. If the number of shares of CenterState
Common Stock or NCC Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective
Time shall be increased or decreased, or changed into or exchanged for a
different number of kind of shares or securities, in any such case as a result
of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock combination, stock dividend,
recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction, or
there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution with respect to such
stock, and the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, an
appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger
Consideration to give Holders of NCC Common Stock the same economic effects as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 

ARTICLE III 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF NCC

 

Section 3.01.Making of Representations and Warranties. Except as disclosed in
the disclosure schedule delivered by NCC to CenterState concurrently herewith
(the "NCC Disclosure Schedule") or in the NCC SEC Reports filed on or after
January 1, 2018, and prior to the date of this Agreement, NCC hereby
represents and warrants to CenterState that the statements contained in this
Article III are correct. "Knowledge" or "knowledge" as to NCC and any other
phrase of similar import means, with respect to any matter in question
relating to NCC, the knowledge of those individuals set forth in NCC
Disclosure Schedule Section 3.01. NCC has made a good faith effort to ensure
that the disclosure on each schedule of the NCC Disclosure Schedule
corresponds to the section referenced

   

herein. However, for purposes of the NCC Disclosure Schedule, any item
disclosed on any schedule therein or disclosed in the NCC SEC Reports filed on
or after January 1, 2018, and prior to the date of this Agreement is deemed to
be fully disclosed with respect to all sections of this Agreement to which
such item may be relevant, (a) in the case of schedules, to the extent that it
is reasonably clear on the face of such schedule that such item applies to
such other section of this Agreement, and (b) in the case of NCC SEC Reports,
to the extent that such item would be reasonably inferred to apply. 

 

Section 3.02.Organization, Standing and Authority.

 

(a)NCC is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware and is a bank holding company duly
registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended ("BHC Act"),
that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company under the BHC
Act. NCC has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. NCC is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on NCC. NCC Disclosure
Schedule Section 3.02(a) sets forth a complete and accurate list of all
jurisdictions where NCC is qualified to do business. True and complete copies
of the Certificate of Incorporation of NCC (the "NCC Certificate") and the
Bylaws of NCC (the "NCC Bylaws"), as in effect as of the date of this

existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly
qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under
applicable Law, in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state,

qualified would not reasonably be likely, either individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on NCC and (iii) has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. There are no

warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character calling
for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other

(a)NCC has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger

of NCC (or the Compensation Committee thereof) pursuant to Section 2.02, no
other corporate proceedings on the part of NCC or any of its Subsidiaries are
necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by NCC and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by
CenterState) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of NCC enforceable
against NCC in accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
moratorium, reorganization or similar laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting insured depository institutions or the rights of creditors
generally and subject to general principles of equity (the "Enforceability
Exceptions")).

 

(b)Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by NCC nor the
consummation by NCC or any of its Subsidiaries of the transactions
contemplated hereby, nor compliance by NCC with any of the terms or provisions
hereof, will (i) violate any provision of the NCC Certificate or the NCC
Bylaws or any equivalent documents of any NCC Subsidiary or (ii) assuming that

upon any of the respective properties or assets of NCC or any of its
Subsidiaries under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which NCC or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound,
except (in the case of clause (ii) above) for such violations, conflicts,
breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations or creations
which, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on NCC.

contemplated by this Agreement and declaration of effectiveness of the

Securities Act, and such other compliance with the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, as may be required in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (e)

pursuant to the FBCA and the Certificate of Merger with the Division of
Corporations in the Department of State of the State of Delaware pursuant to

required to be made or obtained under the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of
various states in connection with the issuance of the shares of CenterState
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement (the consents and approval listed in
clauses (a) and (b), the "Regulatory Approvals"), no consents or approvals of
or filings or registrations with any Governmental Authority are necessary in
connection with (i) the execution and delivery by NCC of this Agreement or
(ii) the consummation by NCC or any of its Subsidiaries of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby (including the consummation by NBC of
the Bank Merger). As of the date of this Agreement, NCC is not aware of any
reason why the necessary Regulatory Approvals and consents will not be
received in order to permit consummation of the Merger and Bank Merger on a
timely basis.

 

Section 3.06.Reports.

 

(a)NCC and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed (or furnished, as
applicable) all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required
to file (or furnish, as applicable) since January 1, 2016 with (i) any state
regulatory authority, (ii) the SEC, (iii) the Federal Reserve Board, (iv) the
FDIC, and (v) the OCC (each a "Regulatory Agency" and collectively, the
"Regulatory Agencies"), including any report, registration or statement
required to be filed (or furnished, as applicable) pursuant to the laws, rules
or regulations of the United States, any state, or any Regulatory Agency, and
have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith,
except where the failure to file such report, registration or statement or to
pay such fees and assessments, either individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on NCC or any of
its Subsidiaries. Except for examinations of NCC and its Subsidiaries
conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the Ordinary Course of Business, no
Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the
knowledge of NCC, investigation into the business or operations of NCC or any
of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2016, except where such proceedings or
investigation would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on NCC or any of its Subsidiaries.
There is no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory
Agency with respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations or
inspections of NCC or any of its Subsidiaries, which would reasonably be
likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on NCC or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(b)An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by NCC or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2016
(the "NCC SEC Reports") is publicly available. No such NCC SEC Report, at the
time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of registration
statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates
of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that information
filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement)
shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. Except as set
forth on NCC Disclosure Schedule Section 3.06(b), as of their respective
dates, all NCC SEC Reports filed or furnished under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act complied as to form in all material respects with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. Except as set forth on
NCC Disclosure Schedule Section 3.06(b), as of the date

   

of this Agreement, no executive officer of NCC has failed in any respect to
make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding
comments from or material unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to
any of the NCC SEC Reports. None of the Subsidiaries of NCC file or, since
January 1, 2016, has been required to file any reports, registrations or
statements pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

 

Section 3.07.Financial Statements.

 

(a)The financial statements of NCC and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the NCC SEC Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of NCC and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows,
changes in shareholders' equity and consolidated financial position of NCC and
its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective
dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-
end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of
their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except,
in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The
books and records of NCC and its Subsidiaries have been, since January 1,
2016, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with
GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements. Porter Keadle
Moore, LLC has not resigned (or informed NCC that it intends to resign) or
been dismissed as independent public accountants of NCC as a result of or in
connection with any disagreements with NCC on a matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure.

 

(b)Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on NCC, neither NCC nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except,
(i) for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of NCC included in its Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2018 (including any notes
thereto), (ii) for liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business
consistent with past practice since September 30, 2018, (iii) as set forth in
NCC Disclosure Schedule Section 3.07(b) or (iv) in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c)The records, systems, controls, data and information of NCC and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of NCC and its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on NCC. NCC (i) has implemented and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of
the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to NCC,
including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and
the Chief Financial Officer of NCC by others within NCC and its Subsidiaries
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to
make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to NCC's outside auditors and the audit
committee of the board of directors of NCC (A) any significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect NCC's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (B) to the knowledge of NCC,
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in NCC's internal controls over
financial

   

reporting (copies of such items in subsections (A) and (B), to the extent
applicable, have previously been made available by NCC to CenterState). To the
knowledge of NCC, there is no reason to believe that NCC's Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 

(d)Since January 1, 2016, (i) neither NCC nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to
the knowledge of NCC, any director, executive officer, auditor, accountant or
representative of NCC or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of NCC, oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods
(including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and
accruals) of NCC or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or written claim that NCC or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing NCC or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by NCC or
any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of
securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by NCC or any
of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the board of directors of
NCC or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of NCC, to any director or
officer of NCC.

 

Section 3.08.Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

 

(a)Since December 31, 2017, no event or events have occurred that have had or
would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on NCC.

 

(b)Since December 31, 2017, except as set forth on NCC Disclosure Schedule
Section 3.08(b) or with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby or as
required or permitted by this Agreement, NCC and its Subsidiaries have carried
on their respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary
course.

 

Section 3.09.Legal Proceedings.

 

(a)Except as set forth on NCC Disclosure Schedule Section 3.09(a), neither NCC
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to
NCC's knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other
proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of
any nature against NCC or any of its Subsidiaries or, to NCC's knowledge, any
of their current or former directors or executive officers (i) that would
reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on NCC or (ii) reasonably likely to prevent,
materially impede or materially delay its ability to perform its covenants and
agreements under this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(b)There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction
(other than those that apply to bank holding companies generally and to banks
generally) imposed upon NCC, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of NCC or
any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Merger, would apply
to the Surviving Entity or any of its Affiliates).

 

Section 3.10.Taxes and Tax Returns.

 

(a)Except as disclosed in NCC Disclosure Schedule Section 3.10(a), each of NCC
and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (taking into account all
applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all jurisdictions in which
Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true,
correct, and complete in all material respects. Neither NCC nor any of its
Subsidiaries is the

   

beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any material Tax
Return, except as set forth in NCC Disclosure Schedule Section 3.10(a). All
material Taxes of NCC and its Subsidiaries that are due have been fully and
timely paid. Each of NCC and its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all
material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with
amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, stockholder, independent
contractor or other third party. Neither NCC nor any of its Subsidiaries has
granted any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any
material Tax that remains in effect. The federal income Tax Returns of NCC and
its Subsidiaries for all years up to and including December 31, 2014 have been
examined by the IRS or are Tax Returns with respect to which the applicable
period for assessment under applicable Law, after giving effect to extensions
or waivers, has expired. The federal income Tax Returns of NCC and its
Subsidiaries for tax years 2015-2017 are still open for examination by the IRS
under the normal statute of limitations. Except as set forth on NCC Disclosure
Schedule Section 3.10(a), no deficiency with respect to a material amount of
Taxes has been proposed, asserted or assessed, in each case, in writing,
against NCC or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no pending or threatened in
writing disputes, claims, audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding
any material Taxes of NCC and its Subsidiaries or the assets of NCC and its
Subsidiaries. In the last six (6) years, neither NCC nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been informed in writing by any jurisdiction that the
jurisdiction believes that NCC or any of its Subsidiaries was required to file
any Tax Return that was not filed. To the extent applicable, NCC has made
available to CenterState true, correct, and complete copies of any private
letter ruling requests, closing agreements or gain recognition agreements with
respect to Taxes requested or executed in the last six (6) years. There are no
Liens for material Taxes (except Taxes not yet due and payable or for Taxes
that are being contested in good faith) on any of the assets of NCC or any of
its Subsidiaries. Neither NCC nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is
bound by any Tax sharing, Tax allocation or Tax indemnification agreement or
arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between
or among NCC and any of its Subsidiaries). Neither NCC nor any of its
Subsidiaries (i) has been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent
of which was NCC) or (ii) has any liability for the Taxes of any Person (other
than NCC or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither NCC nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been, within the past two (2) years or otherwise as part of a
"plan (or series of related transactions)" within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a part, a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section
355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. Neither NCC nor any of its
Subsidiaries has participated in a "listed transaction" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2). At no time during the past five
(5) years has NCC been a United States real property holding corporation
within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code. Neither NCC nor any of
its Subsidiaries will be required to include any material item of income in,
or to exclude any material item of deduction from, taxable income in any
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result
of any (A) change in method of accounting, (B) closing agreement, (C)
intercompany transaction or excess loss account described in Treasury
Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign law), (D) installment sale or open transaction disposition
made on or prior to the Closing Date, or (E) prepaid amount received on or
prior to the Closing Date, in the case of (A), (C), (D) and (E), outside of
the Ordinary Course of Business.

 

(b)As used in this Agreement, the term "Tax" or "Taxes" means all federal,
state, local, and foreign income, excise, gross receipts, ad valorem, profits,
gains, property, capital, sales, transfer, use, license, payroll, employment,
social security, severance, unemployment, withholding, duties, windfall
profits, intangibles, franchise, backup withholding, value added, alternative
or add-on minimum, estimated and other taxes, charges, fees, levies or like
assessments together with all penalties and additions to tax and interest
thereon.

   

(c)As used in this Agreement, the term "Tax Return" means any return,
declaration, report, claim for refund, estimate, or information return or
statement relating to Taxes, including any schedule or attachment thereto, and
including any amendment thereof, supplied or required to be supplied to a
Governmental Authority.

 

Section 3.11.Employees and Employee Benefit Plans.

 

(a)NCC Disclosure Schedule Section 3.11(a) sets forth a true and complete list
of all NCC Benefit Plans. For purposes of this Agreement, "NCC Benefit Plans"
means all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA),
whether or not subject to ERISA, and all stock option, stock purchase,
restricted stock, incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life
insurance, supplemental retirement, retention, bonus, employment, change in
control, termination or severance plans, programs, agreements or arrangements
that are maintained, contributed to or sponsored or maintained by, or required
to be contributed to by, NCC or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of any
current or former employee, officer, director or independent contractor of NCC
or any of its Subsidiaries, or in connection with which NCC or any of its
Subsidiaries has or may have any liability or other obligation.

 

(b)NCC has heretofore made available to CenterState true and complete copies
of (i) each NCC Benefit Plan, including any amendments thereto and all related
trust documents, insurance contracts or other funding vehicles, and (ii) to
the extent applicable, (A) the most recent summary plan description, if any,
required under ERISA with respect to such NCC Benefit Plan, (B) the most
recent annual report (Form 5500), if any, filed with the IRS, (C) the most
recently received IRS determination letter or IRS advisory opinion letter, if
any, relating to such NCC Benefit Plan, (D) the most recently prepared
actuarial report for each NCC Benefit Plan (if applicable) and (E) all
material correspondence to or from any Governmental Authority received in the
last three years with respect to such NCC Benefit Plan.

 

(c)Except as provided in NCC Disclosure Schedule Section 3.11(c), each NCC
Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable
laws, including ERISA and the Code. Neither NCC nor any of its Subsidiaries
has, within the prior three (3) years, taken any action to take corrective
action or make a filing under any voluntary correction program of the IRS,
Department of Labor or any other Governmental Authority with respect to any
NCC Benefit Plan, and NCC has no knowledge of any plan defect that would
qualify for correction under any such program.

 

(d)The IRS has issued a favorable determination or advisory opinion letter
with respect to each NCC Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code, which letter has not been revoked (nor has
revocation been threatened in writing), and, to the knowledge of NCC, there
are no existing circumstances and no events have occurred that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such
NCC Benefit Plan. No trust funding any NCC Benefit Plan is intended to meet
the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

 

(e)Neither NCC nor any ERISA Affiliate has any liability or other obligation
in connection with or, within the past six years, maintained a NCC Benefit
Plan that is or was subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA.

 

(f)Except as provided in NCC Disclosure Schedule Section 3.11(f), none of NCC,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at
any time during the last six (6) years any liability or other obligation in

of ERISA or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of
whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of
ERISA. For purposes of this Agreement, "ERISA Affiliate" means, with respect
to any

   

entity, trade or business, any other entity, trade or business that is, or was

(m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA that includes or
included the first entity, trade or business, or that is, or was at the
relevant time, a member of the same "controlled group" as the first entity,
trade or business pursuant to Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA.

 

(g)Except as provided in NCC Disclosure Schedule Section 3.11(g), neither NCC
nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has sponsored or has any obligation with
respect to any employee benefit plan that provides for any post-employment or
post-retirement health or medical or life insurance benefits for retired or
former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except as required by
Section 4980B of the Code or similar state law.

 

(h)All contributions required to be made to any NCC Benefit Plan by applicable
Law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and all premiums
due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any NCC Benefit
Plan, for any period in the prior three (3) years through the date of this
Agreement, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully
reflected on the books and records of NCC, as applicable, except as, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in any material liability to NCC or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(i)Except as would not, either individually or in the aggregate reasonably be
expected to result in a material liability to NCC or any of its Subsidiaries,
(i) there are no pending or, to NCC's knowledge, threatened claims (other than
claims for benefits in the Ordinary Course of Business), lawsuits or
arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and, (ii) to NCC's
knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that may reasonably be expected to
give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against NCC Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries
thereof with respect to their duties to the NCC Benefit Plans or the assets of
any of the trusts under any of the NCC Benefit Plans.

 

(j)None of NCC, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section
4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which could subject any of the NCC
Benefit Plans or their related trusts, NCC, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates to any material unpaid Tax or material
penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

 

(k)Except as provided in NCC Disclosure Schedule Section 3.11(k), neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby may (either alone or in conjunction with any
other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery of,
cause NCC or any of its Subsidiaries to transfer or set aside any assets to
fund any benefits under any NCC Benefit Plan, or increase in the amount or
value of, any payment, right or other benefit to any employee, officer,
director or other service provider of NCC or any of its Subsidiaries. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as provided in NCC Disclosure
Schedule Section 3.11(k), no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in
property or in the form of benefits) by NCC or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a
result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any
other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code. NCC has made available to CenterState preliminary
drafts of Section 280G calculations (that are not final and are based on the

forth therein), which to NCC's knowledge are based on true, correct and
complete data as of the date hereof, in all material respects, with respect to
the individuals identified in such drafts.

409A or 4999 of the Code.

   

(m)Each NCC Benefit Plan that is in any part a "non-qualified deferred
compensation plan" subject to Section 409A of the Code (i) complies and, at
all times after December 31, 2008 has complied, both in form and operation
with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the final regulations
and other applicable guidance thereunder, and (ii) between January 1, 2005 and
December 31, 2008, was operated in good faith compliance with Section 409A, as
determined under applicable guidance of the U.S. Department of the Treasury
and the IRS, except where such noncompliance would not, either individually or
in the aggregate, be likely to result in a material liability to NCC and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 

(n)There are no pending or, to NCC's knowledge, threatened material labor
grievances or unfair labor practice claims or charges against NCC or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other material labor disputes against NCC
or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither NCC nor any of its Subsidiaries is party
to or bound by any collective bargaining or similar agreement with any labor
organization, or work rules or practices agreed to with any labor organization
or employee association applicable to employees of NCC or any of its
Subsidiaries and, to NCC's knowledge, there are no organizing efforts by any
union or other group seeking to represent any employees of NCC or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

Section 3.12.Compliance with Applicable Law. NCC and each of its Subsidiaries
hold, and have at all times since December 31, 2015 held, all licenses,
franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses and ownership of their respective properties,
rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where neither the
cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such license,
franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees or
assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on NCC, and to the knowledge of NCC,
no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license, franchise, permit
or authorization is threatened. Since December 31, 2015, NCC and each of its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with and are not in
material default or violation under any applicable law, statute, order, rule
or regulation of any Governmental Authority applicable to NCC or any of its

discriminatory lending, financing or leasing practices, money-laundering
prevention, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, and all agency requirements relating to the origination, sale and
servicing of mortgage and consumer loans. Except as would not reasonably be
likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
Effect on NCC, neither NCC nor any of its Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of
NCC, any director, officer, employee, agent or other Person acting on behalf
of NCC or any of its Subsidiaries has, directly or indirectly, (a) used any
funds of NCC or any of its Subsidiaries for unlawful contributions, unlawful
gifts, unlawful entertainment or other expenses relating to political
activity, (b) made any unlawful payment to foreign or domestic governmental
officials or employees or to foreign or domestic political parties or

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

Section 3.14.Agreements with Regulatory Agencies. Neither NCC nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement

credit or risk management policies, its management or its business (each,
whether or not set forth in the NCC Disclosure Schedule, an "NCC Regulatory
Agreement"), nor has NCC or any of its Subsidiaries been advised in writing
or, to NCC's knowledge, orally, by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental
Authority that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering, or requesting

likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on

(g)Neither NCC nor any of its Subsidiaries is now nor has it ever been since
December 31, 2015, subject to any material fine, suspension, settlement or
other contract or other administrative agreement or sanction by, or any
reduction in any loan purchase commitment from, any Governmental Authority or
Regulatory Agency relating to the origination, sale or servicing of mortgage
or consumer Loans.

 

(h)As to each Loan that is secured whether in whole or in part, by a guaranty
of the United States Small Business Administration or any other Governmental
Authority, such guaranty is in full force and effect, and to NCC's knowledge,
will remain in full force and effect following the Effective Time, in each
case, without any further action by NCC or any of its Subsidiaries subject to
the fulfillment of their obligations under the agreement with the Small
Business Administration that arise after the date hereof.

 

Section 3.27.Insurance.

 

(a)Except as would not reasonably be likely, either individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on NCC: (i) NCC and each of its
Subsidiaries are insured with reputable insurers against such risks and in
such amounts as the management of NCC reasonably has determined to be prudent
and consistent with industry practice, and neither NCC nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received notice to the effect that any of them are in default
under any material insurance policy; (ii) each such policy is outstanding and
in full force and effect and, except for policies insuring against potential
liabilities of officers, directors and employees of NCC and each of its
Subsidiaries, NCC or one of its Subsidiaries is the sole beneficiary of such
policies; and (iii) all premiums and other payments due under any such policy
have been paid, and all claims thereunder have been filed in due and timely
fashion. NCC Disclosure Schedule Section 3.27(a) identifies all of the
insurance policies currently maintained by NCC and its Subsidiaries, including
the insurer, policy numbers, amount of coverage, effective and termination
dates and any pending claims thereunder involving, individually or in the
aggregate, more than $75,000 ("Insurance Policies"). 

   

(b)NCC Disclosure Schedule Section 3.27(b) sets forth a true, correct and
complete description of all bank owned life insurance ("BOLI") owned by NCC or
any of its Subsidiaries, including the value of such BOLI as of the end of the
quarter prior to the date of this Agreement. The value of the BOLI is and has
been fairly and accurately reflected in NCC's financial statements in
accordance with GAAP. All BOLI is owned solely by NBC and no other Person has
any ownership claims with respect to such BOLI or proceeds of insurance
derived therefrom and, except as disclosed in NCC Disclosure Schedule Section
3.27(b), there is no split dollar or similar benefit under NCC's BOLI.
Neither NCC nor any of its Subsidiaries has any outstanding borrowings secured
in whole or in part by its BOLI. 

 

ARTICLE IV 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CENTERSTATE

 

Section 4.01.Making of Representations and Warranties. Except as disclosed in
the CenterState SEC Reports filed on or after January 1, 2018, and prior to
the date of this Agreement, CenterState hereby represents and warrants to NCC
that the statements contained in this Article IV are correct. "Knowledge" or
"knowledge" as to CenterState and any other phrase of similar import means,
with respect to any matter in question relating to CenterState, the knowledge
of the President, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer,
the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Credit Officer,
and the Chief Administrative Officer of CenterState. Any item disclosed on any
CenterState Disclosure Schedule or disclosed in the CenterState SEC Reports
filed on or after January 1, 2018, and prior to the date of this Agreement is
deemed to be fully disclosed with respect to all sections of this Agreement to
which such item may be relevant, (a) in the case of schedules, to the extent
that it is reasonably clear on the face of such schedule that such item
applies to such other section of this Agreement, and (b) in the case of
CenterState SEC Reports, to the extent that such item would be reasonably
inferred to apply. 

 

Section 4.02.Organization, Standing and Authority.

 

(a)CenterState is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Florida and is a bank holding company
duly registered under the BHC Act that has elected to be treated as a
financial holding company under the BHC Act. CenterState has the corporate
power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. CenterState is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not,
either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on CenterState. True and complete copies of the
CenterState Articles and CenterState Bylaws, as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, have previously been made available by CenterState to NCC.

 

(b)Each Subsidiary of CenterState (a "CenterState Subsidiary") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable Law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified, except
where the failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be likely, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on
CenterState and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own
or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of
CenterState to pay dividends or distributions except under applicable state
law or, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for
restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to all such
regulated entities. The deposit accounts of CenterState Bank are insured by
the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest

   

extent permitted by Law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in
connection therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the
termination of such insurance are pending or, to CenterState's knowledge,
threatened.

provision of applicable state law) and free of preemptive rights, with no
personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No CenterState
Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character calling

purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of such Subsidiary.

 

Section 4.04.Authority; No Violation.

 

(a)CenterState has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger and
the CenterState Share Issuance in connection therewith have been duly and
validly approved by the board of directors of CenterState. The board of
directors of CenterState

   

has determined that the Merger, on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, is in the best interests of CenterState and has directed that the
CenterState Share Issuance be submitted to CenterState's shareholders for
approval at a meeting of such shareholders and has adopted a resolution to the
foregoing effect. Except for the Requisite CenterState Shareholder Approval
and the adoption of the Bank Plan of Merger by the board of directors of
CenterState Bank and CenterState as its sole shareholder, no other corporate
proceedings on the part of CenterState are necessary to approve this Agreement
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by CenterState and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by NCC) constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of CenterState, enforceable against CenterState in accordance with
its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by the
Enforceability Exceptions).

 

(b)Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by CenterState, nor
the consummation by CenterState of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by CenterState with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i)
violate any provision of the CenterState Articles or CenterState Bylaws, or
(ii) assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in Section
4.05 are duly obtained and/or made, (A) violate any law, statute, code,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction
applicable to CenterState, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets or (B) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of any
provision of or the loss of any benefit under, constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or
cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of
CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which CenterState or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of clause (ii) above)
for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations,
cancellations, accelerations or creations which either individually or in the
aggregate would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
CenterState.

 

Section 4.05.Consents and Approvals. Except for: (a) the filing of
applications, filings and notices, as applicable, with the Federal Reserve
Board under the BHC Act and approval of such applications, filings and
notices; (b) the filing of applications, filings and notices, as applicable,
with the OCC in connection with the Bank Merger, under the Bank Merger Act,
and approval of such applications, filings and notices; (c) the filing with
the SEC of the Proxy Statement-Prospectus and the Registration Statement in
which the Proxy Statement-Prospectus will be included as a prospectus, and

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; (e) the filing of the
Articles of Merger with the Florida Secretary of State pursuant to the FBCA

(i) the execution and delivery by CenterState of this Agreement or (ii) the
consummation by CenterState of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (including the consummation by CenterState Bank of the
Bank Merger). As of the date of this Agreement, CenterState is not aware of
any reason why the necessary Regulatory Approvals and consents will not be
received in order to permit consummation of the Merger and Bank Merger on a
timely basis.

   

Section 4.06.Reports.

 

(a)CenterState and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed (or furnished,
as applicable), all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required
to file (or furnish, as applicable) since January 1, 2016, with any Regulatory
Agencies, including any report, registration or statement required to be filed
(or furnished, as applicable) pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations of
the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency,
and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection
therewith, except where the failure to file such report, registration or
statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
CenterState and its Subsidiaries. Except for examinations of CenterState and
its Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the Ordinary Course of
Business, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or,
to the knowledge of CenterState, investigation into the business or operations
of CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2016, except where
such proceedings or investigation would not reasonably be likely to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
CenterState. There is no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any
Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement relating to any
examinations or inspections of CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries, which
would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on CenterState.

 

(b)An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2016
(the "CenterState SEC Reports") is publicly available. No such CenterState SEC
Report, at the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except
that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of
this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.
As of their respective dates, all CenterState SEC Reports filed or furnished
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of
CenterState has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of
him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date
of this Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or material
unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the CenterState SEC
Reports.

 

Section 4.07.Financial Statements.

 

(a)The financial statements of CenterState and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the CenterState SEC Reports (including the
related notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in
accordance with, the books and records of CenterState and its Subsidiaries,
(ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of
operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders' equity and consolidated
financial position of CenterState and its Subsidiaries for the respective
fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the
case of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature
and amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the
SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and (iv)
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in
the notes thereto. The books and records of CenterState and its Subsidiaries
have been, since January 1, 2016, and are being, maintained in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP and any

   

other applicable legal and accounting requirements. Crowe Horwath LLP has not
resigned (or informed CenterState that it intends to resign) or been dismissed
as independent public accountants of CenterState as a result of or in
connection with any disagreements with CenterState on a matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure.

 

(b)Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on CenterState, neither CenterState
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due
or to become due), except (i) for those liabilities that are reflected or
reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of CenterState included in
its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017
(including any notes thereto), (ii) for liabilities incurred in the Ordinary
Course of Business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2017 or
(iii) in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(c)The records, systems, controls, data and information of CenterState and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of CenterState or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on CenterState.
CenterState (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to CenterState, including its Subsidiaries, is
made known to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of
CenterState by others within CenterState and its Subsidiaries as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the
certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to CenterState's outside auditors and the
audit committee of CenterState's board of directors (A) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect CenterState's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (B) to the
knowledge of CenterState, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in CenterState's
internal controls over financial reporting. To the knowledge of CenterState,
there is no reason to believe that CenterState's outside auditors and its
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will not be able to give
the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 

(d)Since January 1, 2016, (i) neither CenterState nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of CenterState, any director, executive officer,
auditor, accountant or representative of CenterState or any of its
Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or, to the
knowledge of CenterState, oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of CenterState or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or written claim that
CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting
or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing CenterState or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by CenterState or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by CenterState or any of
its officers, directors, employees or agents to the board of directors of
CenterState or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of CenterState, to
any director or officer of CenterState.

   

Section 4.08.Taxes. Each of CenterState and its Subsidiaries has duly and
timely filed (taking into account all applicable extensions) all material Tax
Returns in all jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by
it, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material
respects. Neither CenterState nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary
of any extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return. All
material Taxes of CenterState and its Subsidiaries that are due have been
fully and timely paid. Each of CenterState and its Subsidiaries have withheld
and paid all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in
connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, stockholder,
independent contractor or other third party. No deficiency with respect to a
material amount of Taxes has been proposed, asserted or assessed, in each
case, in writing, against CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no
pending or threatened in writing disputes, claims, audits, examinations or
other proceedings regarding any material Taxes of CenterState and its
Subsidiaries or the assets of CenterState and its Subsidiaries. In the last
three (3) years, neither CenterState nor its Subsidiaries have been informed
in writing by any jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that CenterState
or its Subsidiaries were required to file any Tax Return that was not filed.
There are no Liens for material Taxes (except Taxes not yet due and payable or
Taxes being contested in good faith) on any of the assets of CenterState or
any of its Subsidiaries. Neither CenterState nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification
agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement
exclusively between CenterState and its Subsidiaries). Neither CenterState
nor its Subsidiaries (a) have been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent
of which was CenterState) or (b) has a liability for Taxes of any Person
(other than CenterState and its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign law),
as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither CenterState
nor any of its Subsidiaries has been, within the past two (2) years or
otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of related transactions)" within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a part, a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock intended to
qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. Neither
CenterState nor its Subsidiaries have participated in a "listed transaction"
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

 

Section 4.09.Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

 

(a)Since December 31, 2017, no event or events have occurred that have had or
would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on CenterState.

 

(b)Since December 31, 2017, except with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby or as required or permitted by this Agreement, CenterState
and its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all
material respects in the Ordinary Course of Business.

 

Section 4.10.Legal Proceedings.

 

(a)Neither CenterState nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and
there are no pending or, to CenterState's knowledge, threatened, legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental
or regulatory investigations of any nature against CenterState or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to CenterState's knowledge, any of their current or former
directors or executive officers (i) that would reasonably be likely to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
CenterState, or (ii) reasonably likely to prevent, materially impede or
materially delay its ability to perform its covenants or agreements under this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

   

(b)There is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory
restriction (other than those that apply to bank holding companies generally
and to banks generally) imposed upon CenterState, any of its Subsidiaries or
the assets of CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon
consummation of the Merger, would apply to the Surviving Entity or any of its
Affiliates).

 

Section 4.11.Compliance with Applicable Law. CenterState and each of its
Subsidiaries hold, and have at all times since December 31, 2015, held, all
licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses and ownership of their respective
properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all
fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where
neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such
license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees
or assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on CenterState, and to the knowledge
of CenterState, no suspension or cancellation or any such necessary license,
franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. Since December 31, 2015,
CenterState and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all material
respects with and are not in material default or violation under any
applicable law, statute, order, rule or regulation of any Governmental

would not reasonably be likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to
have a Material Adverse Effect on CenterState, none of CenterState or its
Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of CenterState, any director, executive
officer, employee, agent or other Person acting on behalf of CenterState or
any of its Subsidiaries has, directly or indirectly, (a) used any funds of
CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries for unlawful contributions, unlawful

of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or
enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent
agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment
letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by,
or has been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or has adopted any
policies, procedures or board

   

resolutions at the request or suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Authority that, in each of any such cases, currently restricts in
any material respect the conduct of its business or that in any material
manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends, its
credit or risk management policies, its management or its business (each, a
"CenterState Regulatory Agreement"), nor has CenterState or any of its
Subsidiaries been advised in writing or, to CenterState's knowledge, orally,
by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Authority that it is
considering issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any such CenterState
Regulatory Agreement.

 

Section 4.13.Reorganization. CenterState has not taken any action and is not
aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent
the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

obtain the Requisite CenterState Shareholder Approval, and subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, CenterState shall continue to use
commercially reasonable efforts to solicit proxies from its shareholders (as
applicable) in order to obtain the Requisite CenterState Shareholder Approval;
provided, however, that the obligations in the foregoing sentence with respect
to adjourning or postponing the CenterState Meeting and to continuing to
solicit proxies shall not apply from and after such time, if any, that NCC
would have the right to terminate this Agreement under Section 7.01(h)(i).
CenterState shall keep NCC updated with respect to the proxy solicitation
results in connection with the CenterState Meeting as reasonably requested by
NCC.

 

(iii)Subject to Section 7.01 and Section 7.02, following an Intervening Event,
if the board of directors of CenterState, after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel, and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors, determines in good faith that it would be more likely than not to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue
to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement, such board of
directors may submit this Agreement to its shareholders without recommendation
(although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date of this
Agreement may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the board of
directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its
shareholders in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto to the extent required by Law; provided that the
CenterState board of directors may not take any actions under this sentence
unless (i) it gives NCC at least five (5) Business Days' prior written notice
of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event
or circumstances

   

giving rise to its determination to take such action, and (ii) at the end of
such notice period, the CenterState board of directors takes into account any
amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by NCC and after
receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and, with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that it would
nevertheless be more likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law to continue to recommend this Agreement.
CenterState shall adjourn or postpone the CenterState Meeting if, as of the
time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient
shares of CenterState Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy)
to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or
if on the date of such meeting CenterState has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite
CenterState Shareholder Approval, and subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, CenterState shall continue to use commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit proxies from its shareholders (as applicable) in order to
obtain the Requisite CenterState Shareholder Approval.

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms, each of the CenterState Meeting
and NCC Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the
shareholders of CenterState and the stockholders of NCC at the CenterState
Meeting and the NCC Meeting, respectively, for the purpose of voting on the
approval or adoption (as applicable) of such proposals and the other matters
contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
either CenterState or NCC of such obligation. NCC and CenterState will each
provide to the other Party, promptly (and in any event one hour prior to the
NCC Meeting or the CenterState Meeting, as applicable) following any request
for such information, any information that is in the possession of or
reasonably obtainable by such Party with respect to the status of proxies
(including shares represented and their voting instructions) with respect to
the NCC Meeting or the CenterState Meeting, as applicable.

 

Section 5.05.Registration Statement; Proxy Statement-Prospectus.

 

(a)Each Party shall reasonably cooperate with the other Party in order for
CenterState to prepare and file the Registration Statement (including the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus and all related documents) with the SEC in
connection with the issuance of CenterState Common Stock in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. NCC shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver to CenterState such financial statements and related
analysis of NCC, including "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" of NCC as may be required in order to
file the Registration Statement, and any other report required to be filed by
CenterState with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, in each case in compliance in all material respects with
applicable Laws, and shall, as promptly as practicable following execution of
this Agreement, prepare and deliver drafts of such information to CenterState
to review. Each Party agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with the other Party and its counsel and accountants in requesting
and obtaining appropriate opinions, consents and letters from independent
auditors in connection with the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus. CenterState shall, as soon as is practicable, but in no
event later than forty-five (45) days after the date hereof, file the
Registration Statement with the SEC. Each of NCC and CenterState shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all documents that it is responsible
for filing with the SEC in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby to comply as to form and substance in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act. Each of CenterState and NCC agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared
effective by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing
thereof and to maintain such effectiveness for as long as necessary to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. CenterState also agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any necessary state

   

securities law or "blue sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. After the Registration Statement
is declared effective under the Securities Act, CenterState and NCC, each at
their own expense, shall promptly mail or cause to be mailed the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus to their respective shareholders or stockholders, as
applicable.

 

(b)CenterState will advise NCC, promptly after CenterState receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order
or the suspension of the qualification of CenterState Common Stock for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any
proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the
amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or upon the receipt of
any comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC or its staff, and shall
supply NCC with copies of all correspondence between CenterState and the SEC
with respect to the Registration Statement. CenterState will provide NCC and
its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement-Prospectus, and all responses
to requests for additional information by and replies to comments of the SEC
prior to filing such with, or sending such to, the SEC, and CenterState will
provide NCC and its counsel with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC.
If at any time prior to the NCC Meeting or the CenterState Meeting there shall
occur any event that should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Registration Statement, CenterState shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file such
amendment or supplement with the SEC (if required under applicable Law), mail
such amendment or supplement to CenterState shareholders (if required under
applicable Law), and cooperate with NCC to mail such amendment or supplement
to NCC stockholders (if required under applicable Law).

 

(c)Each of the Parties agrees that if it becomes aware that any information
furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the Proxy Statement-
Prospectus or the Registration Statement to be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the
other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus or the Registration Statement.

 

Section 5.06.Regulatory Filings; Consents.

 

(a)Each of CenterState and NCC and their respective Subsidiaries shall
cooperate and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts (i) to
promptly prepare all documentation, and to effect all filings, to obtain all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Regulatory Approvals and all other consents and
approvals of a Governmental Authority required to consummate the Merger in the
manner contemplated herein, (ii) to comply with the terms and conditions of
such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations, (iii) to resolve any
objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein, and (iv) to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated as expeditiously
as practicable; provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
require CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries or NCC or any of its
Subsidiaries to take any action, or commit to take any such action, or agree
to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of any Governmental Authority
that would reasonably be likely to have a material and adverse effect
(measured on a scale relative to NCC) on the condition (financial or
otherwise), results of operations or business of the Surviving Entity or the
Surviving Bank, after giving effect to the Merger (together, the "Burdensome
Conditions"); provided, further, that those actions set forth in CenterState
Disclosure Schedule Section 5.06(a) shall not constitute a "Burdensome
Condition." CenterState and NCC will furnish each other and each other's
counsel with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries,
directors, trustees, officers and shareholders or stockholders, as applicable,
and such other matters as may be necessary or

   

advisable in connection with any application, petition or any other statement
or application made by or on behalf of CenterState or NCC to any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Each Party hereto shall have the right to review and approve in advance all
characterizations of the information relating to such Party and any of its
Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any Governmental Authority,
other than materials filed in connection therewith under a claim of
confidentiality. CenterState shall, as soon as is practicable, but no later
than thirty (30) days after the date hereof, make all filings with
Governmental Authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC. In
addition, CenterState and NCC shall each furnish to the other for review a
copy of each such filing made in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement with any Governmental Authority prior to its filing;
provided that Section 5.05 provides for the filing of the Registration
Statement and this Section 5.06(a) does not apply to the filing of the
Registration Statement.

 

(b)Subject to applicable Laws (including those relating to the exchange of
information), CenterState and NCC shall keep each other apprised of the status
of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to
applicable Laws, the Parties shall (i) promptly furnish each other with copies
of notices or other communications received by each Party (or written or oral
summaries of communications received orally), from any Governmental Authority
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii)
provide the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and
accept the reasonable comments of the other Party in connection with, any
proposed communication to, including any filings with or other written
materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority. Each Party acknowledges
and agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall require or permit either Party
to provide or disclose confidential supervisory information to the other
Party.

 

(c)NCC will use its commercially reasonable efforts, and CenterState shall
reasonably cooperate with NCC at NCC's request, to obtain all consents,
approvals, authorizations, waivers or similar affirmations required to be
obtained in connection with the Merger or the Bank Merger, which are denoted
in NCC Disclosure Schedule Section 3.13(c) under the caption "consents and
approvals to be sought." Each Party will notify the other Party promptly and
shall promptly furnish the other Party with copies of notices or other
communications received by such Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or
another Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from such Party, its
Subsidiaries or its representatives). NCC will consult with CenterState and
its representatives as often as practicable under the circumstances so as to
permit NCC and CenterState and their respective representatives to cooperate
to take appropriate measures to obtain such consents and avoid or mitigate any
adverse consequences that may result from the foregoing.

 

(d)CenterState will file a Listing of Additional Shares Notification with
NASDAQ for the shares of CenterState Common Stock to be issued in connection
with the Merger in accordance with applicable NASDAQ requirements.

 

Section 5.07.Publicity. CenterState and NCC shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other Party,
which shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld; provided,
however, that a Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party (but
after such consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances),
issue such press release or make such public statements as may upon the advice
of counsel be required by Law or the rules and regulations of any stock
exchanges upon which such Party's stock is listed or traded. It is understood
that CenterState shall assume primary

   

responsibility for the preparation of joint press releases relating to this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.08.Access; Current Information.

 

(a)For the purposes of preparing for the Merger and the other matters
contemplated by this Agreement, upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable Laws, NCC agrees to afford CenterState and its officers, employees,
counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives such access during
normal business hours at any time and from time to time throughout the period
prior to the Effective Time to NCC and its Subsidiaries' books, records
(including, without limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent
auditors), information technology systems, business, properties and personnel
and to such other information relating to them as CenterState may reasonably
request and NCC shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide any
appropriate notices to employees and/or customers in accordance with
applicable Law and NCC's privacy policy and, during such period, NCC shall
furnish to CenterState, upon CenterState's reasonable request, all such other
information concerning the business, properties and personnel of NCC and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, that is substantially similar in scope to the
information provided to CenterState in connection with its diligence review
prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

(b)As promptly as reasonably practicable after they become available, NCC will
furnish to CenterState copies of the board packages distributed to the board
of directors of NCC or NBC, and minutes from the meetings thereof and all
committees thereof, copies of any internal management financial control
reports showing actual financial performance against plan and previous period,
and copies of any reports provided to the board of directors of NCC or any
committee thereof relating to the financial performance, operations, or risk
management of NCC.

 

(c)During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
each of NCC and CenterState will cause one or more of its designated
representatives to confer on a regular basis with representatives of the other
Party and to report the general status of the ongoing operations of NCC and
its Subsidiaries and CenterState and its Subsidiaries, respectively. Without
limiting the foregoing, NCC agrees to provide to CenterState (i) a copy of
each report filed by NCC or any of its Subsidiaries with a Governmental
Authority unless it is a confidential communication with a Governmental
Authority and NCC is prohibited by Law from sharing such report, (ii) a copy
of NCC's monthly loan trial balance, and (iii) a copy of NCC's monthly
statement of condition and profit and loss statement and, if requested by
CenterState, a copy of NCC's daily statement of condition and daily profit and
loss statement, in each case, which shall be provided as promptly as
reasonably practicable after it is filed or prepared, as applicable.

 

(d)No investigation by either Party or its representatives shall be deemed to
modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
other Party set forth in this Agreement, or the conditions to the respective
obligations of either Party to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(e)Neither NCC nor CenterState shall be required to give the other Party any
documents (including under Sections 5.08(a) and (b)) that disclose any
confidential supervisory information or any other matter that such party's
board of directors has been advised by counsel that such distribution to the
other Party may violate a confidentiality obligation or fiduciary duty or any
Law or regulation, or may result in a waiver of such Party's attorney-client
privilege. In the event any of the restrictions in this Section 5.08(e) shall
apply, each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide
appropriate consents, waivers, decrees and approvals necessary to satisfy any
confidentiality issues relating to documents prepared or held by third parties
(including work papers), and the Parties will make appropriate alternate
disclosure arrangements, including adopting additional specific procedures to
protect the confidentiality of sensitive material and to ensure compliance
with applicable Laws.

   

(f)The Non-Disclosure Agreement dated as of September 13, 2018, entered into
by and between CenterState and NCC (the "Confidentiality Agreement") will
remain in full force and effect following the date of this Agreement, whether
or not the Merger occurs, in accordance with the terms thereof, and each of
CenterState and NCC shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of
the other party or any of such party's Subsidiaries or representatives
pursuant to this Agreement in confidence to the extent required by, and in
accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 5.09.No Solicitation by NCC; Superior Proposals.

 

(a)From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, NCC shall not, shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and each of its and their respective officers and directors not
to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries' other employees and the NCC Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or take any
action to facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an NCC Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) except as permitted by this Section 5.09, participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding any NCC Acquisition Proposal or furnish,
or otherwise afford access, to any Person (other than CenterState) any
information or data with respect to NCC or any of its Subsidiaries or
otherwise relating to an NCC Acquisition Proposal; (iii) release any Person
from, waive any provisions of, or fail to enforce any confidentiality
agreement or standstill agreement to which NCC is a party; or (iv) except for
a confidentiality agreement permitted by Section 5.09(b), enter into any
agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent with respect to any NCC
Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any NCC Acquisition
Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent relating
to an NCC Acquisition Proposal. NCC and each of its Subsidiaries shall, and
shall cause each of the NCC Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any and all existing discussions, negotiations, and
communications with any Persons with respect to any existing or potential NCC
Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b)Notwithstanding Section 5.09(a) or any other provision of this Agreement,
prior to the NCC Meeting, NCC may take any of the actions described in Section
5.09(a)(ii) if, but only if, (i) NCC has received a bona fide unsolicited
written NCC Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section
5.09(a); (ii) the board of directors of NCC reasonably determines in good
faith, after consultation with and having considered the advice of its outside
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that (A) such NCC Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal
and (B) it is reasonably necessary to take such actions to comply with its
fiduciary duties to NCC's stockholders under applicable Law; (iii) NCC has
provided CenterState with at least three (3) Business Days' prior notice of
such determination; and (iv) prior to furnishing or affording access to any
information or data with respect to NCC or any of its Subsidiaries or
otherwise relating to an NCC Acquisition Proposal, NCC receives from such
Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to NCC than
those contained in the confidentiality agreement with CenterState. NCC shall
promptly provide to CenterState any non-public information regarding NCC or
any of its Subsidiaries provided to any other Person which was not previously
provided to CenterState, such additional information to be provided no later
than the date such information is provided to such other Party.

 

(c)NCC shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify
CenterState in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any
information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought
to be initiated or continued with, NCC or the NCC Representatives, in each
case in connection with any NCC Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall
indicate the name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or
making such proposal, offer or information request and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials
relating to such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or
discussion, providing copies of such materials

   

(including e-mails or other electronic communications), except to the extent
that (i) discussions of such materials jeopardizes the attorney-client
privilege or (ii) disclosure of such materials contravenes any Law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment or decree). NCC agrees that it shall keep
CenterState informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and terms
of any such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussions
(including any amendments or modifications to such proposal, offer or
request).

 

(d)Neither the board of directors of NCC nor any committee thereof shall (i)
subject to Sections 5.09(e) and (f), withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, or
propose to withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to
CenterState in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Merger), the NCC Recommendation, fail to reaffirm the NCC
Recommendation within three (3) Business Days following a request by
CenterState, or make any statement, filing or release, in connection with the
NCC Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the NCC Recommendation (it being
understood that taking a neutral position or no position with respect to an
NCC Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification of the
NCC Recommendation); (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend any NCC Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into (or cause NCC or
any of its Subsidiaries to enter into) any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement (A) related to any NCC
Acquisition Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into
in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.09(b)) or (B) requiring NCC to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e)Notwithstanding Section 5.09(d) and subject to compliance with this Section
5.09(e), prior to the approval of the Merger at the NCC Meeting, the board of
directors of NCC may withdraw, qualify, amend or modify the NCC Recommendation
(an "NCC Subsequent Determination") after the fifth (5th) Business Day
following CenterState's receipt of a notice (the "Notice of Superior
Proposal") from NCC advising CenterState that the board of directors of NCC
has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written NCC Acquisition Proposal that
it received (that did not result from a breach of Section 5.09(a)) constitutes
a Superior Proposal if, but only if, (i) the board of directors of NCC has
determined in good faith, after consultation with and having considered the
advice of outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that it is
reasonably necessary to take such actions to comply with its fiduciary duties
to NCC's stockholders under applicable Law, (ii) during the five (5) Business
Day period after receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal by CenterState
(the "Notice Period"), NCC and the board of directors of NCC shall have
cooperated and negotiated in good faith with CenterState to make such
adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would enable NCC to proceed with the NCC Recommendation without
an NCC Subsequent Determination; provided, however, that CenterState shall not
have any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (iii) at the end of the Notice
Period, after taking into account any such adjusted, modified or amended terms
as may have been proposed by CenterState since its receipt of such Notice of
Superior Proposal, the board of directors of NCC has again in good faith made
the determination (A) in clause (i) of this Section 5.09(e) and (B) that such
NCC Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. In the event of any
material revisions to the Superior Proposal, NCC shall be required to deliver
a new Notice of Superior Proposal to CenterState and again comply with the
requirements of this Section 5.09(e), except that the Notice Period shall be
reduced to three (3) Business Days.

 

(f)Subject to Section 7.01 and Section 7.02, if, following an Intervening
Event, the board of directors of NCC, after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel, and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors, determines in good faith that it would be more likely than not to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue
to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement, such board of
directors may submit this Agreement to its shareholders without recommendation
(although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date of this
Agreement may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the board of
directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its
shareholders in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or

   

supplement thereto to the extent required by Law; provided that the NCC board
of directors may not take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives
CenterState at least five (5) Business Days' prior written notice of its
intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or
circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action, and (ii)
at the end of such notice period, the NCC board of directors takes into
account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by
CenterState and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and, with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith
that it would nevertheless be more likely than not to result in a violation of
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue to recommend this
Agreement.

 

(g)Nothing contained in this Section 5.09 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit NCC or the board of directors of NCC from complying with Rule
14e-2(a), Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or other applicable securities laws; provided, however, that any
such disclosure relating to an NCC Acquisition Proposal (other than a "stop,
look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9 under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed a change in the NCC
Recommendation unless the board of directors of NCC reaffirms the NCC
Recommendation in such disclosure.

 

Section 5.10.Indemnification. 

 

(a)From and after the Effective Time, and in any event subject to the
provisions of Section 5.10(c)(iv), the Surviving Entity shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the present and former directors, officers and
employees of NCC, NBC and their respective Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified
Parties"), against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorney's
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, or liabilities or amounts
that are paid in settlement (which settlement shall require the prior written
consent of CenterState, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative arising out of actions or omissions of such persons in the
course of performing their duties for or at the request of NCC, NBC or their
respective Subsidiaries occurring at or before the Effective Time (including
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (each a
"Claim"), regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or
after, the Effective Time, to the fullest extent as such persons have the
right to be indemnified pursuant to the NCC Certificate or NCC Bylaws or
similar governing documents of NBC in effect on the date of this Agreement and
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Delaware Law. The Surviving
Entity shall pay such expenses to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by the provisions of Delaware Law and the NCC Certificate and NCC
Bylaws or similar governing documents of NBC.

 

(b)In connection with the indemnification provided pursuant to this Section
5.10, the Surviving Entity and/or Surviving Bank will advance expenses,
promptly after statements therefor are received, to each Indemnified Party, to
the fullest extent required or permitted by the NCC Certificate, the NCC
Bylaws and the articles of association and bylaws of NBC in effect on the date
of this Agreement and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law
(provided the individual to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
to repay such advance if it is ultimately determined that such individual is
not entitled to indemnification), including the payment of the fees and
expenses of one counsel with respect to a matter, and one local counsel in
each applicable jurisdiction, if necessary or appropriate, selected by such
Indemnified Party or multiple Indemnified Parties (and, in each case,
reasonably acceptable to CenterState), it being understood that they
collectively shall only be entitled to one counsel and one local counsel in
each applicable jurisdiction where necessary or appropriate (unless a conflict
shall exist between them in which case they may retain separate counsel).

 

(c)Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
5.10 shall promptly notify CenterState upon learning of any Claim, provided
that, failure to so notify shall not affect

   

the obligation of CenterState under this Section 5.10, unless, and only to the
extent that, CenterState is materially prejudiced in the defense of such Claim
as a consequence. In the event of any such Claim (whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time), (i) CenterState shall have the
right to assume the defense thereof and CenterState shall not be liable to
such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses or other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof except that if CenterState elects not to assume such
defense, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
them, and CenterState shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties (provided that CenterState shall only be
obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one such counsel), (ii)
the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter,
(iii) CenterState shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent and (iv) CenterState shall have no obligation hereunder
to any Indemnified Party if such indemnification would be in violation of any
applicable federal or state banking laws or regulations, or in the event that
a federal or state banking agency or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Laws, whether or not related
to banking laws.

 

(d)For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity will maintain director's and officer's liability insurance ("DandO
Insurance") that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and
directors of NCC or NBC and their respective Subsidiaries (determined as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) with respect to claims against such
Indemnified Parties arising from facts or events occurring at or before the
Effective Time (including the Merger and other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement), which insurance will contain at least the same coverage and
amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Party, as that coverage currently provided by NCC; provided that,
if the Surviving Entity is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called
for by this Section 5.10, the Surviving Entity will provide as much comparable
insurance as is reasonably available (subject to the limitations described
below in this Section 5.10(d)); and provided, further, that officers and
directors of NCC or NBC may be required to make application and provide
customary representations and warranties to the carrier of the DandO Insurance
for the purpose of obtaining such insurance. In no event shall the Surviving
Entity be required to expend for such tail insurance a premium amount in
excess of $1,500,000 in the aggregate (the "Maximum DandO Tail Premium"). If
the cost of such tail insurance exceeds the Maximum DandO Tail Premium, the
Surviving Entity shall obtain tail insurance coverage or a separate tail
insurance policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
the Maximum DandO Tail Premium. For the avoidance of doubt, the Surviving Entity
shall not be required to purchase stand-alone coverage for cyber liability or
fidelity bonds.

 

(e)This Section 5.10 shall survive the Effective Time, is intended to benefit
each Indemnified Party (each of whom shall be entitled to enforce this Section
5.10 against the Surviving Entity), and shall be binding on all successors and
assigns of the Surviving Entity. This Section 5.10 shall not be amended,
altered or repealed after the Effective Time without the prior written consent
of the affected Indemnified Party.

 

(f)If the Surviving Entity or any of its successors and assigns (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its property and
assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries shall assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 5.10.

   

Section 5.11.Employees; Benefit Plans.

 

(a)Following the Effective Time, CenterState shall maintain or cause to be
maintained employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the
benefit of employees who are full time employees of NCC or any of its
Affiliates on the Closing Date ("Covered Employees") that provide employee
benefits and compensation opportunities which, in the aggregate, are
substantially comparable to the employee benefits and compensation
opportunities that are made available on a uniform and non-discriminatory
basis to similarly-situated employees of CenterState or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable; provided, however, that in no event shall any Covered Employee be
eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan of CenterState or its
Subsidiaries, including any such plan that is closed or frozen with respect to
new employees of CenterState. CenterState shall give the Covered Employees
full credit for their prior service with NCC and any of its Affiliates (i) for
purposes of eligibility (including initial participation and eligibility for
current benefits) and vesting under any qualified or non-qualified employee
benefit plan maintained by CenterState and in which Covered Employees may be
eligible to participate and (ii) for all purposes under any welfare benefit
plans, vacation plans, severance plans and similar arrangements maintained by
CenterState.

 

(b)With respect to any employee benefit plan of the Surviving Entity that is a
health, dental, vision or other welfare plan in which any Covered Employee is
eligible to participate, for the plan year in which such Covered Employee is
first eligible to participate, the Surviving Entity or its applicable
Subsidiary shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause any pre-
existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such
Surviving Entity or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered
Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent such condition was or
would have been covered under the NCC Benefit Plan in which such Covered
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
recognize any health, dental, vision or other welfare expenses incurred by
such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents in the year that
includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Covered
Employee is first eligible to participate) for purposes of any applicable
copayment, deductibles and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any
such health, dental, vision or other welfare plan. Neither CenterState nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall terminate the existing coverage of any Covered
Employee or his or her dependents under any of the NCC or Affiliate health,
dental, vision or other welfare plans, programs or benefits prior to the time
such Covered Employees and their dependents become eligible to participate in
the health, dental or other welfare plans, programs and benefits common to all
employees of CenterState or any CenterState Subsidiary and their dependents.

 

(c)Prior to the Effective Time and subject to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, NCC shall take, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to take, all actions requested no later than ten (10)
days prior to the Closing by CenterState that may be necessary or appropriate
to (i) cause one or more NCC Benefits Plans to terminate as of the Effective
Time, or as of the date immediately preceding the date that includes the
Effective Time, (ii) cause benefit accruals and entitlements under any NCC
Benefit Plan to cease as of the Effective Time, or as of the date immediately
preceding that date that includes the Effective Time, (iii) cause the
continuation on and after the Effective Time of any contract, arrangement or
insurance policy relating to any NCC Benefit Plan for such period as may be
requested by CenterState, or (iv) facilitate the merger of any NCC Benefit
Plan into any employee benefit plan maintained by CenterState or a CenterState
Subsidiary; provided that NCC shall not be required to take any action that
would result in the violation by NCC of any contract with a third party. All
resolutions, notices, or other documents issued, adopted or executed in
connection with the implementation of this Section 5.11(c) shall be subject to
CenterState's reasonable prior review, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If CenterState requires NCC to terminate a
medical plan having a flexible spending arrangement ("FSA") under Section 125
of the Code, NCC and each of its Subsidiaries may continue its FSA through the
Effective Time.

   

(d)Nothing in this Section 5.11 shall be construed to (i) limit the right of
CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date,
NCC or any of its Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any NCC Benefit Plan or
other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is
permitted by the terms of the applicable plan; (ii) establish, amend, or
modify any NCC Benefit Plan or CenterState Benefit Plan or any other benefit
or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement; or (iii) require
CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date,
NCC and any of its Subsidiaries) to retain the employment of any particular
Covered Employee for any fixed period of time following the Closing Date, and
the continued retention (or termination) by CenterState or any of its
Subsidiaries of any Covered Employee subsequent to the Effective Time shall be
subject in all events to CenterState's or its applicable Subsidiary's normal
and customary employment procedures and practices, including customary
background screening and evaluation procedures, and satisfactory employment
performance.

 

(e)If, within the period ending on the later of (i) nine (9) months after the
Effective Time or (ii) forty-five (45) days after the completion of the
Informational Systems Conversion, unless otherwise addressed in an employment
agreement entered into with CenterState or CenterState Bank or an employment,
change in control or severance agreement set forth in NCC Disclosure Schedule
Section 3.11(a), any Covered Employee who is terminated by CenterState or its
Subsidiaries other than "for cause" (as defined under the policies of
CenterState and/or its Subsidiaries) or resigns because he or she was offered
a position with a material reduction in rate of base pay or that is outside a
50-mile radius of the current address of his or her primary work location at
NCC or any of its Subsidiaries, then CenterState shall, subject to such
Covered Employee's execution of appropriate releases, pay severance to such
Covered Employee in an amount equal to two (2) weeks of base salary for each
twelve (12) months of such Covered Employee's prior employment with NCC, NBC
or any applicable Subsidiary; provided, however, that in no event will the
total amount of severance for any single Covered Employee be less than four
(4) weeks of such base salary nor greater than twenty-six (26) weeks of such
base salary. Any severance to which a Covered Employee may be entitled in
connection with a termination occurring more than nine (9) months after the
Effective Time will be as set forth in the severance policies of CenterState
and its Subsidiaries as then in effect.

 

(f)After the Effective Time, all accrued and unused sick time for all
employees of NCC and any of its Subsidiaries and all accrued and unused
vacation time for all employees of NCC and any of its Subsidiaries shall be
treated as set forth in CenterState Disclosure Schedule Section 5.11(f).

 

(g)The Parties understand and agree that, as a matter of law, subject to and
as a result of the Merger and the Bank Merger, respectively, CenterState will
assume and become responsible for all contractual obligations, and shall
succeed to all contractual obligations, of NCC (including employment,
supplemental executive retirement benefits, split-dollar and other agreements)
as of the Effective Time, and CenterState Bank will assume and be responsible
for all contractual obligations, and shall succeed to all contractual
obligations, of NBC (including employment, supplemental executive retirement
benefits, split-dollar and other agreements) as of the effective time of the
Bank Merger. Prior to the Effective Time, if CenterState requests NCC's
assistance with respect to implementing new or replacement employment related
agreements for one or more employees of NCC or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger, NCC agrees to (and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to) cooperate in good faith to facilitate and assist with respect to
implementing any such new or replacement employment related agreements.

 

(h)CenterState shall take all commercially reasonable actions necessary,
including any needed plan or policy amendments, to cause the trustee of the
CenterState Banks, Inc. Employee Savings Trust, if requested to do so by a
Covered Employee, to accept a direct "rollover" in cash of all or a portion of
such employee's distribution from NCC's (or its Affiliate's) qualified 401(k)
savings plan (collectively, the "NCC 401(k) Plan") (provided that the
CenterState Banks, Inc. Employee Savings Trust shall only accept

   

cash and not in kind rollovers). In the case of a Covered Employee with an
outstanding loan(s) under the NCC 401(k) Plan, CenterState shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to permit the Covered Employee to rollover
such outstanding loan balance(s) to the CenterState Banks, Inc. Employee
Savings Trust (subject to the requirements and limitations of the applicable
provisions of the Code); provided, however, that the Covered Employee may
transfer such loan(s) only if such Covered Employee elects to rollover his or
her entire account balance under the NCC 401(k) Plan.

 

(i)NCC shall establish a retention bonus pool to be paid to certain NCC
employees as shall be determined by NCC after consultation with CenterState
(including in amounts of payments and timing of payments), with the amounts of
such retention bonuses payable pursuant to the retention bonus pool not to
exceed the amounts set forth on NCC Disclosure Schedule Section 5.11(i)
attached hereto. CenterState may establish an additional retention bonus pool,
with such recipients, amounts of payments and timing of payments designated by
CenterState.

 

Section 5.12.Notification of Certain Changes. NCC and CenterState shall
promptly advise the other Party of any change or event having, or which could
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect or which it believes
would, or which could reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its or its respective Subsidiaries' representations,
warranties or covenants contained herein, and NCC and CenterState shall
provide on a periodic basis written notice to the other Party of any matters
that it becomes aware of which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such
NCC Disclosure Schedule or CenterState Disclosure Schedule, as applicable,
which is necessary to correct any information in such NCC Disclosure Schedule
or CenterState Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, which has been rendered
materially inaccurate thereby; provided, that any failure to give notice in
accordance with the foregoing shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of
this Section 5.12 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 6.02(a)
or Section 6.02(b) or Section 6.03(a) or Section 6.03(b), as the case may be,
to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the
Party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach
would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section
6.02(a) or Section 6.02(b) or Section 6.03(a) or Section 6.03(b), as the case
may be, to be satisfied. No supplement or amendment to the NCC Disclosure
Schedule or CenterState Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, or provision of
information relating to the subject matter of the NCC Disclosure Schedule or
CenterState Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, after the date of this
Agreement shall operate to cure any breach of a representation or warranty
made herein or have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of
or compliance by NCC or CenterState with the respective covenants and
agreements of such parties set forth herein.

 

Section 5.13.Transition; Informational Systems Conversion. From and after the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, CenterState and NCC shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to facilitate the integration of NCC with the business of CenterState
following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall meet
on a regular basis to discuss and plan for the conversion of the data
processing and related electronic informational systems of NCC and its
Subsidiaries (the "Informational Systems Conversion") to those used by
CenterState, which planning shall include, but not be limited to, (a)
discussion of third-party service provider arrangements of NCC and its
Subsidiaries; (b) non-renewal or changeover, after the Effective Time, of
personal property leases and software licenses used by NCC and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the systems operations; (c) retention of
outside consultants and additional employees to assist with the conversion;
(d) outsourcing, as appropriate after the Effective Time, of proprietary or
self-provided system services; and (e) any other actions necessary and
appropriate to facilitate the conversion, by the end of the third quarter of
2019.

   

Section 5.14.No Control of Other Party's Business. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give CenterState, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the operations of NCC or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give NCC, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of CenterState or
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time,
each of NCC and CenterState shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, control and supervision over its and its
Subsidiaries' respective operations.

 

Section 5.15.Certain Litigation. Each Party shall promptly advise the other
Party orally and in writing of any actual or threatened shareholder or
stockholder litigation against such Party and/or the members of the board of
directors of NCC or the board of directors of CenterState related to this
Agreement or the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. NCC shall: (a) permit CenterState to review and discuss in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of CenterState in connection
with, any proposed written or oral response to such shareholder or stockholder
litigation; (b) furnish CenterState's outside legal counsel with all non-
privileged information and documents which outside counsel may reasonably
request in connection with such shareholder or stockholder litigation; (c)
consult with CenterState regarding the defense or settlement of any such
shareholder or stockholder litigation; and (d) give due consideration to
CenterState's advice with respect to such shareholder or stockholder
litigation and shall not settle any such litigation prior to such consultation
and consideration; provided, however, that NCC shall not settle any such
shareholder or stockholder litigation if such settlement requires the payment
of money damages, without the written consent of CenterState (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the payment of any
such damages by NCC is reasonably expected by NCC, following consultation with
outside counsel, to be fully covered (disregarding any deductible to be paid
by NCC) under NCC's existing director and officer insurance policies.

 

Section 5.16.Corporate Governance.

 

(a)Effective as of the Effective Time, CenterState shall take all actions
necessary to cause the then-current members of the board of directors of

and the Surviving Bank until such time as their successors are duly elected
and qualified. Prior to the Effective Time, the CenterState Continuing
Directors shall take all actions necessary to appoint (effective as of the
Effective Time) (i) the three (3) then-current members of the board of

Directors"), until such time as their successors are duly elected and
qualified. The nominating committee of the board of directors of the Surviving
Entity shall cause the New CenterState Directors that have been appointed and
are serving on the board of directors of the Surviving Entity to be included
among CenterState's nominees for election at the 2019 (if the Effective Time
occurs prior to the 2019 annual meeting of CenterState shareholders) and 2020
annual meetings of shareholders of the Surviving Entity (provided that they
remain reasonably acceptable to the nominating committee of the board of
directors of Surviving Entity). The Surviving Entity and the Surviving Bank
shall cause the New CenterState Directors that have been appointed to and are
serving on the board of directors of the Surviving Bank to be reelected
(provided that they remain reasonably acceptable to the nominating committee
of the board of directors of the Surviving Entity) at the 2019 (if the
Effective Time occurs prior to the 2019 annual meeting of CenterState
shareholders) and 2020 annual meetings of the Surviving Bank.

Section 5.21.Coordination. 

 

(a)Prior to the Effective Time, subject to applicable Laws, each of NCC and
each of its Subsidiaries shall take any action CenterState may reasonably
request from time to time to better prepare the Parties for the integration of
the operations of NCC and its Subsidiaries with CenterState and its
Subsidiaries, respectively. Without limiting the foregoing, senior officers
of NCC and CenterState shall meet from time to time as CenterState may
reasonably request, and in any event not less frequently than monthly, to
review the financial and operational affairs of NCC and its Subsidiaries, and
NCC shall give due consideration to CenterState's input on such matters, with
the understanding that, notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, neither CenterState nor CenterState Bank shall under any
circumstance be permitted to exercise control of NCC or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. NCC shall permit representatives of
CenterState Bank to be onsite at NCC to facilitate integration of operations
and assist with any other coordination efforts as necessary, provided such
efforts shall be done without disruption to NBC's business with its customers.

 

(b)Prior to the Effective Time, subject to applicable Laws, NCC and each of
its Subsidiaries shall take any actions CenterState may reasonably request in
connection with negotiating any amendments, modifications or terminations of
any Leases or NCC Contracts that CenterState may request, including, but not
limited to, actions necessary to cause any such amendments, modifications or
terminations to become effective prior to (to the extent that the conditions
set forth in Sections 6.01(a) and 6.01(b) of this Agreement have already been
satisfied), or immediately upon, the Closing, and shall cooperate with
CenterState and use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate specific
provisions that may be requested by CenterState in connection with any such
amendment, modification or termination.

 

(c)From and after the date hereof, subject to applicable Laws, the Parties
shall reasonably cooperate (provided that the Parties shall cooperate to
reasonably minimize disruption to NCC's or NBC's

   

business) with the other in preparing for the prompt conversion or
consolidation of systems and business operations promptly after the Effective
Time (including by entering into customary confidentiality, non-disclosure and
similar agreements with the other Party and appropriate service providers),
and NCC shall, upon CenterState's reasonable request, introduce CenterState
and its representatives to suppliers of NCC and its Subsidiaries for the
purpose of facilitating the integration of NCC and its business into that of
CenterState. In addition, after satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 6.01(a) and Section 6.01(b), subject to applicable Laws, NCC shall,
upon CenterState's reasonable request, introduce CenterState and its
representatives to customers of NCC and its Subsidiaries for the purpose of
facilitating the integration of NCC and its business into that of CenterState.
Any interaction between CenterState and any of NCC and its Subsidiaries'
customers and suppliers shall be coordinated by NCC. NCC shall have the right
to participate in any discussions between CenterState and NCC's customers and
suppliers.

 

(d)CenterState and NCC agree to take all action necessary and appropriate to
cause NBC to merge with CenterState Bank in accordance with applicable Laws
and the terms of the Bank Plan of Merger immediately following (and subject to
the occurrence of) the Effective Time or as promptly as practicable
thereafter.

 

Section 5.22.Transactional Expenses. NCC has provided in NCC Disclosure
Schedule Section 5.22 a reasonable good faith estimate of costs and fees that
NCC and its Subsidiaries expect to pay to retained representatives in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, exclusive of
any costs that may be incurred by NCC as a result of any litigation which may
arise in connection with this Agreement (collectively, "NCC Expenses"). NCC
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the aggregate amount of
all NCC Expenses to not exceed the total expenses disclosed in NCC Disclosure
Schedule Section 5.22. NCC shall promptly notify CenterState if or when it
determines that it expects to materially exceed its estimate for NCC Expenses.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.22, neither Party
shall incur any investment banking, brokerage, finders or other similar
financial advisory fees in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement other than those expressly set forth in NCC Disclosure Schedule
Section 3.23.

 

Section 5.23.Confidentiality. Prior to the execution of this Agreement and
prior to the consummation of the Merger, subject to applicable Laws, each of
CenterState and NCC, and their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates, officers,
directors, agents, employees, consultants and advisors have provided, and will
continue to provide one another with information which may be deemed by the
Party providing the information to be non-public, proprietary and/or
confidential, including, but not limited to, trade secrets of the disclosing
Party. Each Party agrees that it will, and will cause its representatives to,
hold any information so obtained, whether pursuant to this Article V or
otherwise, in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, and
that the Confidentiality Agreement will survive the termination of this
Agreement and shall not be limited or extended by this Section 5.23.

 

Section 5.24.Tax Matters. The Parties intend that the Merger qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this
Agreement constitute a "plan of reorganization" as that term is used in
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. Except as expressly contemplated or
permitted by this Agreement, from and after the date of this Agreement and
until the Effective Time, each of CenterState and NCC shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and will
not knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any
action or cause any action to fail to be taken which action or failure to act
is intended or is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

   

Section 5.25.Assumption of Subordinated Debt. As of the Effective Time and
upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, CenterState shall assume all
rights and obligations of NCC under and relating to the NCC Debentures,
including the due and punctual payment of the principal of and any premium and
interest on the NCC Debentures according to their terms, and the due and
punctual performance of all covenants and conditions relating to the NCC
Debentures to be performed or observed by NCC. As of the Effective Time, the
NCC Debentures shall rank pari passu to CenterState's other subordinated debt
obligations issued and outstanding from time to time. The Parties shall
cooperate in good faith to execute, deliver and obtain any documents or
consents deemed necessary by the Parties, in consultation with counsel to
effectuate the assumption in accordance with the requirements of the NCC
Debentures and CenterState's existing debt instruments, including but not
limited to, any trustee and holder notifications or consents that must be
delivered or obtained, as applicable, prior to or in connection with the
assumption.

 

Section 5.26.Section 16 Matters. 

 

(a)Prior to the Effective Time, CenterState shall take all such steps as may
be required to cause any acquisitions of CenterState Common Stock resulting
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to CenterState to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act. NCC agrees to promptly furnish CenterState with all
requisite information necessary for CenterState to take the actions
contemplated by this Section 5.26(a).

 

(b)NCC and CenterState agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and
retain those officers and directors of NCC subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the "NCC Insiders"), both
prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that the NCC Insiders
not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in connection with the
conversion of shares of NCC Common Stock in the Merger, and for such
compensatory and retention purposes agree to this Section 5.26(b). The boards
of directors of CenterState and of NCC, or a committee of non-employee
directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under
the Exchange Act), shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as
may be necessary or appropriate to cause (i) any disposition of NCC Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to NCC Common Stock) by
any NCC Insiders and (ii) any acquisition of CenterState Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to CenterState Common Stock) by
any NCC Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or
directors of the Surviving Entity subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case, pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt for liability pursuant to Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law.

 

Section 5.27.Certification of Non-USRPI Status. NCC shall provide to
CenterState, under penalties of perjury, a certificate dated as of the Closing
Date conforming to the requirements of Regulations Sections 1.897-2(h) and
1.1445-2(c)(3) in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit G
certifying that no interest in NCC is a United States real property interest
as defined in Section 897(c) of the Code.

ARTICLE VII

 

TERMINATION

 

Section 7.01.Termination. At any time prior to the Effective Time, this
Agreement may be terminated, and the transactions contemplated hereby may be
abandoned:

 

(a)Mutual Consent. By the mutual consent, in writing, of CenterState and NCC
if the board of directors of CenterState and the board of directors of NCC
each so determines by vote of a majority of the members of its entire board.

 

(b)No Regulatory Approval. By CenterState or NCC, if either of their
respective boards of directors so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its entire board, in the event any Regulatory Approval required for
consummation of the Merger or Bank Merger shall have been denied by final,
non-appealable action by such Governmental Authority or an application
therefor shall have been permanently withdrawn at the request of a
Governmental Authority, unless the failure to obtain such Regulatory Approval
shall be due to the failure of the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement
to perform or observe the covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

 

(c)No NCC Stockholder or CenterState Shareholder Approval. By CenterState
(provided, in the case of CenterState, that it shall not be in material breach
of any of its obligations under Section 5.04), or by NCC (provided, that in
the case of NCC, that it shall not be in material breach of any of its
obligations under Section 5.04 or Section 5.09), if (i) the Requisite NCC
Stockholder Approval at the NCC Meeting or (ii) the Requisite CenterState
Shareholder Approval at the CenterState Meeting shall not have been obtained
by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held meeting of
such stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof.

 

(d)Breach of Representations and Warranties. By either CenterState or NCC
(provided that the terminating Party is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein in a
manner that would entitle the other Party to not consummate this Agreement) if
there shall have been (i) with respect to representations and warranties set
forth in this

   

Agreement that are not qualified by the term "material" or do not contain
terms such as "Material Adverse Effect," a material breach of any of such
representations or warranties by the other Party and (ii) with respect to
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement that are qualified
by the term "material" or contain terms such as "Material Adverse Effect," any
breach of any of such representations or warranties by the other Party; which
breach is not cured prior to the earlier of (A) thirty (30) days following
written notice to the Party committing such breach from the other Party or (B)
two (2) Business Days prior to the Expiration Date, or which breach, by its
nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing; provided, however, that neither
Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.01(d) unless the breach of representation or warranty, together with
all other such breaches, would entitle the terminating Party not to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby under Section 6.02(a) (in the case of a
breach of a representation or warranty by CenterState) or Section 6.03(a) (in
the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by NCC).

 

(e)Breach of Covenants. By either CenterState or NCC (provided that the
terminating Party is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein in a manner that would
entitle the other Party not to consummate this Agreement) if there shall have
been a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the other Party, which breach shall not have been
cured prior to the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days following written notice to
the Party committing such breach from the other Party or (ii) two (2) Business
Days prior to the Expiration Date, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be
cured prior to the Closing; provided, however, that neither Party shall have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(e) unless
the breach of covenant or agreement, together with all other such breaches,
would entitle the terminating Party not to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby under Section 6.02(b) (in the case of a breach of a
representation or warranty by CenterState) or Section 6.03(b) (in the case of
a breach of a representation or warranty by NCC).

 

(f)Delay. By either CenterState or NCC if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before November 23, 2019 (the "Expiration Date"), unless the
failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to a material breach
of this Agreement by the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement.

 

(g)Failure of NCC to Recommend. In addition to and not in limitation of
CenterState's termination rights under Section 7.01(e), by CenterState if,
prior to such time as the Requisite NCC Stockholder Approval is obtained, (i)
there shall have been a material breach of Section 5.09 or (ii) the board of
directors of NCC (A) withdraws, qualifies, amends, modifies or withholds the
NCC Recommendation, or makes any statement, filing or release, in connection
with the NCC Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the NCC Recommendation
(it being understood that taking a neutral position or no position with
respect to an NCC Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an adverse
modification of the NCC Recommendation), (B) materially breaches its
obligation to call, give notice of and commence the NCC Meeting under Section
5.04(a), (C) approves or recommends an NCC Acquisition Proposal, (D) fails to
publicly recommend against a publicly announced NCC Acquisition Proposal
within three (3) Business Days of being requested to do so by CenterState, (E)
fails to publicly reconfirm the NCC Recommendation within three (3) Business
Days of being requested to do so by CenterState, or (F) resolves or otherwise
determines to take, or announces an intention to take, any of the foregoing
actions.

 

(h)Failure of CenterState to Recommend. In addition to, and not in limitation
of, NCC's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(e), by
NCC prior to such time as the Requisite CenterState Shareholder Approval is
obtained if (i) the board of directors of CenterState (A) withdraws,
qualifies, amends, modifies or withholds the CenterState Recommendation, or
makes any statement, filing or release, in connection with the CenterState
Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the CenterState Recommendation, (B)
fails to publicly reconfirm the CenterState Recommendation within three (3)
Business Days of being requested to do so by NCC, or (C) resolves or otherwise
determines to take, or

   

announces an intention to take, any of the foregoing actions or (ii)
CenterState or its board of directors has breached its obligations under
Section 5.04 in any material respect.

 

(i)CenterState Stock Price. By NCC, if the board of directors of NCC so
determines by a vote of the majority of the members of the entire board of
directors of NCC, at any time during the five-day period commencing with the
Determination Date, if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

 

(A)The quotient obtained by dividing the CenterState Average Stock Price by
the Initial CenterState Market Price (such quotient being the "CenterState
Ratio") shall be less than 0.85; and

 

(B)The CenterState Ratio shall be less than eighty-five percent of the
quotient of the (x) Final Index Price divided by (y) the Initial Index Price
(such quotient being the "Index Ratio");

 

Following delivery of such written notice of termination by NCC, this
Agreement shall terminate upon the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date
such notice was provided (the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that
NCC's notice of election to terminate may be withdrawn at any time prior to
the Termination Date; and provided, further, that during the five (5) Business
Day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, CenterState shall have
the option to increase the Merger Consideration by either (1) increasing the
Exchange Ratio (calculated to the nearest one-thousandth) or (2) provided that
it does not, and will not, prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (as
determined by CenterState's and NCC's outside legal counsel), paying, as part
of the Merger Consideration, a cash payment in addition to, and not in lieu
of, the Merger Consideration otherwise payable in accordance with Section
2.01(c) (such cash payment, the "Additional Cash Consideration"), in each case
of the immediately preceding clauses (1) and (2), such that the value of the
Merger Consideration (calculated based on the CenterState Average Stock Price)
plus the value of any Additional Cash Consideration to be received by each
recipient of the Merger Consideration equals the lesser of the following: (I)
an amount equal to the product of the Initial CenterState Market Price, 0.85,
and the Exchange Ratio (as in effect immediately before any increase in the
Exchange Ratio pursuant to this Section 7.01(i)); and (II) an amount equal to
(x) the product of the Index Ratio, 0.85, the Exchange Ratio (as in effect
immediately before any increase in the Exchange Ratio pursuant to this Section
7.01(i)) and the CenterState Average Stock Price, divided by (y) the
CenterState Ratio. If CenterState so elects within such five (5) Business Day
period, then it shall give prompt written notice to NCC of such election and
the revised Exchange Ratio or the Additional Cash Consideration, as
applicable, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this
Section 7.01(i) and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with
its terms, provided that any references in this Agreement to the "Exchange
Ratio" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio as increased
pursuant to this Section 7.01(i), if applicable, and any references in this
Agreement to the Merger Consideration shall thereafter include the Additional
Cash Consideration as set forth in this Section 7.01(i), if applicable.

 

If CenterState declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction between the date of this Agreement and the Determination Date, the
prices for the CenterState Common Stock shall be appropriately adjusted for
the purposes of applying this Section 7.01(i).

 

Section 7.02.Termination Fee; Expenses.

 

(a)In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities foregone by
CenterState while structuring and pursuing the Merger, NCC shall pay to
CenterState a termination fee equal to $31,800,000 (the "Termination Fee"), by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by
CenterState in the event of any of the following: (i) in the event CenterState
terminates this

   

Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(g), NCC shall pay CenterState the
Termination Fee within one (1) Business Day after receipt of CenterState's
notification of such termination; and (ii) in the event that after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, an NCC
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to senior management of NCC or
has been made directly to its stockholders generally or any Person shall have
publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an NCC Acquisition Proposal with
respect to NCC and (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated (x) by either
CenterState or NCC pursuant to Section 7.01(c) because the Requisite NCC
Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained or (y) by CenterState
pursuant to Section 7.01(d) or Section 7.01(e) and (B) prior to the date that
is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, NCC enters into any
agreement or consummates an NCC Acquisition Transaction with respect to an NCC
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same NCC Acquisition Proposal as that
referred to above), then NCC shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into
such agreement and the date of consummation of such NCC Acquisition
Transaction, pay CenterState the Termination Fee, provided, that for purposes
of this Section 7.02(a)(ii), all references in the definition of NCC
Acquisition Transaction to "20%" shall instead refer to "50%."

 

(b)If NCC terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(h), CenterState
shall on the date of termination, pay to NCC a sum equal to the amount of the
Termination Fee (the "Reverse Termination Fee"). The Reverse Termination Fee
shall be paid to NCC in same-day funds.

 

(c)NCC and CenterState each agree that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, NCC and CenterState would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if NCC or CenterState fails promptly
to pay any amounts due under this Section 7.02, NCC or CenterState, as
applicable, shall pay interest on such amounts from the date payment of such
amounts were due to the date of actual payment at the rate of interest equal
to the sum of (i) the rate of interest published from time to time in The Wall
Street Journal, Eastern Edition (or any successor publication thereto),
designated therein as the prime rate on the date such payment was due, plus
(ii) 200 basis points, together with the costs and expenses of CenterState or
NCC (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with any
litigation to enforce the other Party's obligations under this Section 7.02.

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Parties agree that if a Party pays or causes to be paid to the other Party the
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.02(a) or the Reverse Termination
Fee in accordance with Section 7.02(b), as applicable, the Party paying such
Termination Fee or Reverse Termination Fee (or any successor in interest
thereof) will not have any further obligations or liabilities to the other
Party with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except in the case of fraud or willful and material breach of any
material provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 7.03.Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Party as provided in Section 7.01, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of CenterState, NCC, any of
their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of
them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Section
5.08(f), Section 5.23, Section 7.02, this Section 7.03 and Article IX (other
than Section 9.01) shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither
CenterState or NCC shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or
damages (which, in the case of NCC, shall include the loss to the holders of
NCC Common Stock, NCC Warrants and NCC Equity Awards of the economic benefits
of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the loss of the premium
offered to the holders of NCC Common Stock, NCC Warrants and NCC Equity
Awards) arising out of its fraud or willful and material breach of any
provision of this Agreement.

of reference; if there is any conflict between a caption or heading and the
text of this Agreement, the text shall control. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation."

 

(b)The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement and the other agreements and documents contemplated herein. In
the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises under
any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement or document
contemplated herein, this Agreement and such other agreements or documents
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of
authorizing any of the provisions of this Agreement or any other agreements or
documents contemplated herein.

   

(c)The NCC Disclosure Schedule and the CenterState Disclosure Schedule, as
well as all other schedules and all exhibits to this Agreement, shall be
deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement.
Any matter disclosed pursuant to any section of either Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed disclosed for purposes of any other section of Article III or
Article IV, respectively, to the extent that applicability of the disclosure
to such other section is reasonably apparent on the face, notwithstanding the
absence of a specific cross-reference, of such disclosure. No item is
required to be set forth in either the NCC Disclosure Schedule or the
CenterState Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or
warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect. The mere inclusion of an item in
either Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty
shall not be deemed an admission by either Party that such item represents a
material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is
reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect, or that any breach
or violation of applicable Laws or any contract exists or has actually
occurred. This Agreement shall not be interpreted or construed to require any
Person to take any action, or fail to take any action, if to do so would
violate any applicable Law.

 

(d)Any reference contained in this Agreement to specific statutory or
regulatory provisions or to any specific Governmental Authority shall include
any successor statute or regulation, or successor Governmental Authority, as
the case may be. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the
masculine, feminine, and neuter genders will be deemed to be interchangeable,
and the singular includes the plural and vice versa. As used herein, (i) the
term "made available" means any document or other information that was (A)
provided by one Party or its representatives to the other Party or its
representatives prior to the date hereof, (B) included in the virtual data
room of a Party prior to the date hereof or (C) filed by a party with the SEC
and publicly available on Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval at
least 48 hours immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (if to be
delivered, provided or made available prior to the date hereof) or the Closing
Date (if to be delivered, provided or made available prior to Closing), and
(ii) the word "or" is not exclusive. 

 

(e)Unless otherwise specified, the references to "Section" and "Article" in
this Agreement are to the Sections and Article of this Agreement. When used
in this Agreement, words such as "herein", "hereinafter", "hereof", "hereto",
and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole, unless the context clearly
requires otherwise.

 

Section 9.10.Assignment. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests or obligations hereunder (whether by operation of Law or
otherwise) without the prior written approval of the other Party, and any
purported assignment in violation of this Section 9.10 shall be void. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

 

Section 9.11.Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile or by electronic data file and in one or more counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Party, it being understood that all Parties
need not sign the same counterpart. Signatures delivered by facsimile or by
electronic data file shall have the same effect as originals.

EXHIBIT A

 

STOCKHOLDER VOTING AGREEMENT

 

This Stockholder Voting Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into as of the
23rd day of November, 2018, by and between CenterState Bank Corporation, a
Florida corporation ("CenterState"), and the undersigned holder
("Stockholder") of Common Stock (as defined herein).

 

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, Stockholder, either in his or her sole
capacity or jointly, is entitled to dispose of (or to direct the disposition
of) and to vote (or to direct the voting of) the number of shares of common
stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), of National Commerce
Corporation ("NCC"), indicated on the signature page of this Agreement under
the heading "Total Number of Shares of Common Stock Initially Subject to this
Agreement" (which, for the avoidance of doubt, do not include any shares of
Common Stock underlying unexercised NCC Equity Awards or NCC Warrants or any
securities beneficially owned by Stockholder as a trustee or fiduciary where
Stockholder does not have voting power); such shares of Common Stock, together
with any other shares of Common Stock the voting power over which is acquired
by Stockholder during the period from and including the date hereof through
and including the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms, are collectively referred to herein as the "Shares";

 

WHEREAS, CenterState and NCC propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"; for purposes of
this Agreement, capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement),
pursuant to which, among other things, NCC will merge with and into
CenterState (the "Merger"); and

 

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of CenterState to enter into the
Merger Agreement, Stockholder is executing this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of, and as a material inducement to,
CenterState entering into the Merger Agreement and proceeding with the
transactions contemplated thereby, and in consideration of the expenses
incurred and to be incurred by CenterState in connection therewith,
Stockholder and CenterState, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as
follows:

 

1.Agreement to Vote Shares. Stockholder agrees that, while this Agreement is
in effect, at any meeting of stockholders of NCC, however called, or at any
adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstances in which Stockholder is
entitled to vote, consent or give any other approval, except as otherwise
agreed to in writing in advance by CenterState, Stockholder shall:

 

    



 |  

(a)

 |  

appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be counted as
present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(b)

 |  

vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, all the Shares as to which
Stockholder has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or direct the
voting, (i) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, any
amendments or modifications of the terms thereof adopted in accordance with
the terms thereof); (ii) in favor of any proposal to adjourn or postpone such
meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies to approve the Merger
Agreement; (iii) against any action or agreement that would result in a breach
of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or
agreement of NCC contained in the Merger Agreement or of Stockholder contained
in this 

---|---|--- 

   

    



 |  |  

Agreement; and (iv) against any Acquisition Proposal or any other action,
agreement or transaction that is intended, or is reasonably expected by the
Stockholder, to impede, interfere or be inconsistent with, delay, postpone,
discourage or materially and adversely affect consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 

 

Stockholder further agrees not to vote or execute any written consent to
rescind or amend in any manner any prior vote or written consent, as a
stockholder of NCC, to approve or adopt the Merger Agreement unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. 

 

2.No Transfers. While this Agreement is in effect and prior to any meeting of
stockholders of NCC called in connection with the Merger, Stockholder agrees
not to, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise
dispose of, or enter into any contract, option, commitment or other
arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge,
assignment or other disposition of, any of the Shares; provided, however, that
the following transfers shall be permitted: (a) transfers by will or
operation of law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee; (b)
transfers pursuant to any pledge agreement, subject to the pledgee agreeing in
writing, prior to such transfer, to be bound by the terms of this Agreement;
(c) transfers in connection with estate and tax planning purposes, including
transfers to relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, subject to each
transferee agreeing in writing, prior to such transfer, to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement; (d) the disposition or surrender of Shares in
connection with the vesting, settlement or exercise of NCC Equity Awards, NCC
Warrants or other equity rights as permitted by the Merger Agreement; (e)
transfers to any immediate family member of Stockholder, or to a trust for the
benefit of Stockholder or his or her immediate family members or upon
Stockholder's death; provided that, as a precondition to such permitted
transfer, the transferee has agreed in writing to abide by the terms of this
Agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to CenterState; and (f) such
transfers as CenterState may otherwise permit in its sole discretion. Any
transfer or other disposition in violation of the terms of this Section 2
shall be null and void. 

 

3.Representations and Warranties of Stockholder. Stockholder represents and
warrants to and agrees with CenterState as follows:

 

    



 |  

(a)

 |  

Stockholder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter into and perform
his, her or its obligations under this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(b)

 |  

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Stockholder, and
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by CenterState,
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Stockholder
enforceable against Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors generally and subject to general principles
of equity. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(c)

 |  

The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder does not, and the
performance by Stockholder of his, her or its obligations hereunder and the
consummation by Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will not,
violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under, any agreement,
instrument, contract or other obligation or any order, arbitration award,
judgment or decree to which Stockholder is a party or by which Stockholder is
bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which Stockholder is subject or,
in the event that Stockholder is a corporation, limited liability company,
partnership, trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or other organizational
document of Stockholder. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(d)

 |  

Stockholder is the direct or joint owner of the Shares. Stockholder does not
have sole or shared voting or dispositive power over any shares of capital
stock of NCC other than the Shares or any 

---|---|--- 

   

    



 |  |  

other securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for such
capital stock, other than any NCC Equity Awards or NCC Warrants. Stockholder
has the right to vote the Shares, and none of the Shares are subject to any
voting trust or other agreement, arrangement or restriction with respect to
the voting of the Shares, except as contemplated by this Agreement. The
Shares do not include shares over which Stockholder exercises control in a
fiduciary capacity for any other person or entity that is not an Affiliate of
Stockholder, and no representation by Stockholder is made with respect
thereto. 

---|---|--- 

 

4.No Solicitation. From and after the date hereof until the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 6 hereof, Stockholder, in his, her or its
capacity as a stockholder of NCC, shall not, nor shall Stockholder in such
capacity authorize any stockholder, member, partner, officer, director,
advisor or representative of Stockholder or any of his, her or its Affiliates
to (and, to the extent applicable to Stockholder, such Stockholder shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to not permit any of his, her or its
representatives or affiliates to), (a) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly
encourage, or take any action to facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer
or proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposal, or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to
any Person (other than CenterState) any information or data with respect to
NCC or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (c) enter into any
agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding or similar arrangement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
(d) solicit proxies with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than the
Merger and the Merger Agreement) or otherwise encourage or assist any party in
taking or planning any action that would reasonably be expected to compete
with, restrain or otherwise serve to interfere with or inhibit the timely
consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement, or (e) initiate a stockholders' vote or action by consent of NCC's
stockholders with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, except in the cases of
clauses (b) through (e), inclusive, of this Section 4 to the extent that at
such time NCC is permitted to take such actions pursuant to Section 5.09 of
the Merger Agreement. 

 

5.Specific Performance; Remedies; Attorneys' Fees. Stockholder acknowledges
that it is a condition to the willingness of CenterState to enter into the
Merger Agreement that Stockholder execute and deliver this Agreement and that
it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to CenterState if
Stockholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and
that, in the event of any such failure, CenterState will not have an adequate
remedy at law. Accordingly, Stockholder agrees that injunctive relief or
other equitable relief is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will
not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that CenterState has an
adequate remedy at law. In addition, after notice to Stockholder, CenterState
shall have the right to inform any third party that CenterState reasonably
believes to be, or to be contemplating, participating with Stockholder or
receiving from Stockholder assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the
terms of this Agreement and of the rights of CenterState hereunder, and that
participation by any such third party with Stockholder in activities in
violation of Stockholder's agreement with CenterState set forth in this
Agreement may give rise to claims by CenterState against such third party.
All expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses.

 

6.Term of Agreement; Termination. The term of this Agreement shall commence
on the date hereof. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by the
written consent of the parties hereto, and this Agreement shall be
automatically terminated upon the earlier to occur of: (a) termination of the
Merger Agreement, (b) the consummation of the Merger, or (c) three (3) years
from the date hereof; provided, however, that the transfer restrictions in
Section 2 hereof shall be automatically terminated upon the receipt of the
Requisite NCC Stockholder Approval. Upon such termination, no party shall
have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder; provided, however, that
such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any breach of
this Agreement prior to such termination.

   

7.Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or modified, and no provision hereof may be modified or waived,
except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of
any provision hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other
provision hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a
continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party. 

 

8.Severability. In the event that any one or more provisions of this
Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Agreement, and the parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as
practical, implements the purpose and intents of this Agreement. 

 

9.Capacity as Stockholder. This Agreement shall apply to Stockholder solely
in his, her or its capacity as a stockholder of NCC, and it shall not apply in
any manner to Stockholder in any capacity as a director, officer or employee
of NCC or in any other capacity. For avoidance of doubt, the parties
acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict
Stockholder or any of his, her or its Affiliates who is or becomes during the
term hereof a member of the board of directors or an officer of NCC or
National Bank of Commerce ("NBC") from acting, omitting to act or refraining
from taking any action, solely in such person's capacity as a member of the
board of directors or as an officer of NCC or NBC consistent with his or her
fiduciary duties in such capacity under applicable law, including under
Section 5.09 of the Merger Agreement.

 

10.Governing Law; Venue. Except to the extent mandatory provisions of
Delaware law apply, this Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to any
applicable conflicts of law principles or any other principle that could
require the application of the law of any other jurisdiction. The sole and
exclusive venue for any civil action, counterclaim, proceeding, or litigation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be the courts of record of
the State of Georgia in Fulton County or the United States District Court,
Northern District of Georgia. Each party consents to the jurisdiction of such
Georgia courts in any such civil action, counterclaim, proceeding, or
litigation and waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such civil
action, counterclaim, proceeding, or litigation in such Georgia courts.
Service of any court paper may be effected on such party by mail, as provided
in this Agreement, or in such other manner as may be provided under applicable
laws, rules of procedure or local rules.

 

11.WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.
EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.

   

12.Further Assurances. Stockholder agrees not to commence or participate in,
and to take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in any class action
with respect to, any claim, derivative or otherwise, against CenterState, NCC
or any of their respective successors relating to the negotiation, execution
or delivery of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger. From time to time prior to the termination of this Agreement, at
CenterState's request and without further consideration, Stockholder shall
execute and deliver such additional documents and take all such further action
as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the actions and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

13.Disclosure. To the extent such information is required to be included,
Stockholder hereby permits CenterState to publish and disclose in the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus and S-4 (including, without limitation, all related
documents and schedules filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission)
his, her or its identity and ownership of shares of Common Stock and the
nature of Stockholder's commitments, arrangements and understandings pursuant
to this Agreement.

 

14.Notices. Any notice, consent, demand, request or other communication given
to a party hereto in connection with this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be deemed to have been given to such party (i) when delivered personally
to such party, or (ii) provided that a written acknowledgment of receipt is
obtained, five (5) days after being sent by prepaid certified or registered
mail, or (iii) two (2) days after being sent by a nationally recognized
overnight courier, to the address (if any) specified below for such party (or

EXHIBIT B

 

SHAREHOLDER VOTING AGREEMENT

 

This Shareholder Voting Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into as of the
23rd day of November, 2018, by and between National Commerce Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("NCC"), and the undersigned holder ("Shareholder") of
CSFL Common Stock (as defined herein).

 

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, Shareholder, either in his or her sole
capacity or jointly, is entitled to dispose of (or to direct the disposition
of) and to vote (or to direct the voting of) the number of shares of common
stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "CSFL Common Stock"), of CenterState
Bank Corporation ("CenterState"), indicated on the signature page of this
Agreement under the heading "Total Number of Shares of CSFL Common Stock
Initially Subject to this Agreement" (which, for the avoidance of doubt, do
not include any shares of CSFL Common Stock underlying unexercised stock
options or any securities beneficially owned by Shareholder as a trustee or
fiduciary where Shareholder does not have voting power); such shares of CSFL
Common Stock, together with any other shares of CSFL Common Stock the voting
power over which is acquired by Shareholder during the period from and
including the date hereof through and including the date on which this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, are collectively
referred to herein as the "Shares";

 

WHEREAS, CenterState and NCC propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"; for purposes of
this Agreement, capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement),
pursuant to which, among other things, NCC will merge with and into
CenterState (the "Merger"); and

 

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of NCC to enter into the Merger
Agreement, Shareholder is executing this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of, and as a material inducement to, NCC
entering into the Merger Agreement and proceeding with the transactions
contemplated thereby, and in consideration of the expenses incurred and to be
incurred by NCC in connection therewith, Shareholder and NCC, intending to be
legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

 

1.Agreement to Vote Shares. Shareholder agrees that, while this Agreement is
in effect, at any meeting of shareholders of CenterState, however called, or
at any adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstances in which Shareholder
is entitled to vote, consent or give any other approval, except as otherwise
agreed to in writing in advance by NCC, Shareholder shall:

 

    



 |  

(a)

 |  

appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be counted as
present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(b)

 |  

vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, all the Shares as to which
Shareholder has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or direct the
voting, (i) in favor of adoption and approval of the CenterState Share
Issuance and any other matters required to be approved by the CenterState
shareholders to permit consummation of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including, without limitation, any
amendments or modifications of the terms thereof adopted in accordance with
the terms thereof); (ii) in favor of any proposal to adjourn or postpone such
meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies to approve the
CenterState Share 

---|---|--- 

   

    



 |  |  

Issuance; (iii) against any action or agreement that would result in a breach
of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or
agreement of CenterState contained in the Merger Agreement or of Shareholder
contained in this Agreement; and (iv) against any action, agreement or
transaction that is intended, or is reasonably expected by the Shareholder, to
impede, interfere or be inconsistent with, delay, postpone, discourage or
materially and adversely affect consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement or this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 

 

Shareholder further agrees not to vote or execute any written consent to
rescind or amend in any manner any prior vote or written consent, as a
shareholder of CenterState, to approve or adopt the Merger Agreement unless
this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. 

 

2.No Transfers. While this Agreement is in effect and prior to any meeting of
shareholders of CenterState called in connection with the Merger, Shareholder
agrees not to, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, pledge, assign or
otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option, commitment or other
arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge,
assignment or other disposition of, any of the Shares; provided, however, that
the following transfers shall be permitted: (a) transfers by will or
operation of law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee; (b)
transfers pursuant to any pledge agreement, subject to the pledgee agreeing in
writing, prior to such transfer, to be bound by the terms of this Agreement;
(c) transfers in connection with estate and tax planning purposes, including
transfers to relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, subject to each
transferee agreeing in writing, prior to such transfer, to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement; (d) the disposition or surrender of Shares in
connection with the vesting, settlement or exercise of equity rights as
permitted by the Merger Agreement; (e) transfers to any immediate family
member of Shareholder, or to a trust for the benefit of Shareholder or his or
her immediate family members or upon Shareholder's death; provided that, as a
precondition to such permitted transfer, the transferee has agreed in writing
to abide by the terms of this Agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to
NCC; and (f) such transfers as NCC may otherwise permit in its sole
discretion. Any transfer or other disposition in violation of the terms of
this Section 2 shall be null and void. 

 

3.Representations and Warranties of Shareholder. Shareholder represents and
warrants to and agrees with NCC as follows:

 

    



 |  

(a)

 |  

Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter into and perform
his, her or its obligations under this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(b)

 |  

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Shareholder, and
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by NCC, constitutes the
valid and legally binding obligation of Shareholder enforceable against
Shareholder in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, reorganization or
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the rights of
creditors generally and subject to general principles of equity. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(c)

 |  

The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder does not, and the
performance by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations hereunder and the
consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will not,
violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under, any agreement,
instrument, contract or other obligation or any order, arbitration award,
judgment or decree to which Shareholder is a party or by which Shareholder is
bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which Shareholder is subject or,
in the event that Shareholder is a corporation, limited liability company,
partnership, trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or other organizational
document of Shareholder. 

---|---|--- 

   

    



 |  

(d)

 |  

Shareholder is the direct or joint owner of the Shares. Shareholder does not
have sole or shared voting or dispositive power over any shares of capital
stock of CenterState other than the Shares or any other securities convertible
into or exercisable or exchangeable for such capital stock, other than any
CenterState stock options. Shareholder has the right to vote the Shares, and
none of the Shares are subject to any voting trust or other agreement,
arrangement or restriction with respect to the voting of the Shares, except as
contemplated by this Agreement. The Shares do not include shares over which
Shareholder exercises control in a fiduciary capacity for any other person or
entity that is not an Affiliate of Shareholder, and no representation by
Shareholder is made with respect thereto.

4.Specific Performance; Remedies; Attorneys' Fees. Shareholder acknowledges
that it is a condition to the willingness of NCC to enter into the Merger
Agreement that Shareholder execute and deliver this Agreement and that it will
be impossible to measure in money the damage to CenterState if Shareholder
fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and that, in
the event of any such failure, NCC will not have an adequate remedy at law.
Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable
relief is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the
granting of such relief on the basis that NCC has an adequate remedy at law.
In addition, after notice to Shareholder, NCC shall have the right to inform
any third party that NCC reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating,
participating with Shareholder or receiving from Shareholder assistance in
violation of this Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and of the rights
of NCC hereunder, and that participation by any such third party with
Shareholder in activities in violation of Shareholder's agreement with NCC set
forth in this Agreement may give rise to claims by NCC against such third
party. All expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses.

 

5.Term of Agreement; Termination. The term of this Agreement shall commence
on the date hereof. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by the
written consent of the parties hereto, and this Agreement shall be
automatically terminated upon the earlier to occur of: (a) termination of the
Merger Agreement, (b) the consummation of the Merger, or (c) three (3) years
from the date hereof; provided, however, that the transfer restrictions in
Section 2 hereof shall be automatically terminated upon the receipt of the
Requisite CenterState Shareholder Approval. Upon such termination, no party
shall have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder; provided,
however, that such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for
any breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

 

6.Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or modified, and no provision hereof may be modified or waived,
except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of
any provision hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other
provision hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a
continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party. 

 

7.Severability. In the event that any one or more provisions of this
Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Agreement, and the parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as
practical, implements the purpose and intents of this Agreement. 

 

8.Capacity as Shareholder. This Agreement shall apply to Shareholder solely
in his, her or its capacity as a shareholder of CenterState, and it shall not
apply in any manner to Shareholder in any capacity

   

as a director, officer or employee of CenterState or in any other capacity.
For avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in this
Agreement shall limit or restrict Shareholder or any of his, her or its
Affiliates who is or becomes during the term hereof a member of the board of
directors or an officer of CenterState or CenterState Bank, N.A. ("CenterState
Bank") from acting, omitting to act or refraining from taking any action,
solely in such person's capacity as a member of the board of directors or as
an officer of CenterState or CenterState Bank consistent with his or her
fiduciary duties in such capacity under applicable law, including under
Section 5.04(b)(iii) of the Merger Agreement. 

 

9.Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to any
applicable conflicts of law principles or any other principle that could
require the application of the law of any other jurisdiction. The sole and
exclusive venue for any civil action, counterclaim, proceeding, or litigation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be the courts of record of
the State of Florida in Polk County or the United States District Court,
Middle District of Florida. Each party consents to the jurisdiction of such
Florida courts in any such civil action, counterclaim, proceeding, or
litigation and waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such civil
action, counterclaim, proceeding, or litigation in such Florida courts.
Service of any court paper may be effected on such party by mail, as provided
in this Agreement, or in such other manner as may be provided under applicable
laws, rules of procedure or local rules.

 

10.WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.
EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.

 

11.Further Assurances. Shareholder agrees not to commence or participate in,
and to take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in any class action
with respect to, any claim, derivative or otherwise, against CenterState, NCC
or any of their respective successors relating to the negotiation, execution
or delivery of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger. From time to time prior to the termination of this Agreement, at
NCC's request and without further consideration, Shareholder shall execute and
deliver such additional documents and take all such further action as may be
reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the actions and consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

12.Disclosure. To the extent such information is required to be included,
Shareholder hereby permits CenterState and NCC to publish and disclose in the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus and S-4 (including, without limitation, all related
documents and schedules filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission)
his, her or its identity and ownership of shares of CSFL Common Stock and the
nature of Shareholder's commitments, arrangements and understandings pursuant

Commerce Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("NCC"), shall be merged with and
into CenterState Bank Corporation, a Florida corporation ("CenterState").

 



 

SECTION 1

 

DEFINITIONS

 



 

1.1Effective Time. "Effective Time" shall mean the date and time on which the
Merger contemplated by this Plan of Merger becomes effective pursuant to the
laws of the States of Florida and Delaware, as determined in accordance with
Section 2.2 of this Plan of Merger.

 



 

1.2Merger. "Merger" shall refer to the merger of NCC with and into
CenterState, as provided in Section 2.1 of this Plan of Merger.

 



 

SECTION 2

 

TERMS OF MERGER

 



 

2.1Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Plan of
Merger, at the Effective Time, NCC shall be merged with and into CenterState
in accordance with the Florida Business Corporation Act and the Delaware
General Corporation Law. CenterState shall be the surviving corporation
resulting from the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to
exist and to be governed by the laws of the State of Florida under the
corporate name "CenterState Bank Corporation." The Surviving Corporation shall
assume all of the liabilities of NCC.

 



 

2.2Effective Time. The Merger contemplated by this Plan of Merger shall be
effective at the later of (i) the latest effective date and time of filing of
the (A) Articles of Merger filed with the Secretary of State of Florida and
(B) the Certificate of Merger filed with the Division of Corporations in the
Department of State of Delaware, or (ii) the date and time set forth in the
Articles of Merger filed with the Secretary of State of Florida and the
Certificate of Merger filed with the Division of Corporations in the
Department of State of Delaware.

 



 

2.3Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the articles
of incorporation of CenterState in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law. The amended and
restated bylaws of CenterState in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the amended and restated bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law and the terms of
such amended and restated bylaws.

 



 

2.4Board of Directors. Effective as of the Effective Time the then-current
directors of CenterState (the "CenterState Continuing Directors") shall
continue in office and serve as directors of the Surviving Corporation until
their successors shall have been duly elected and qualified. Prior to the
Effective Time, the CenterState Continuing Directors shall take all actions
necessary to appoint (effective as of the Effective Time) three (3) of the
directors of NCC as of immediately before the Effective Time to serve as
directors of the Surviving Corporation.

   



 

2.5Officers. Effective as of the Effective Time, the officers of the
Surviving Corporation shall be as set forth on Exhibit A to this Plan of
Merger.

 



 

SECTION 3

 

MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES

 



 

Each share of CenterState common stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following the
Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

 



 

Each share of common stock of NCC owned directly by CenterState, NCC or any of
their respective subsidiaries (other than shares in trust accounts, managed
accounts and the like for the benefit of customers or shares held as
collateral for outstanding debt previously contracted) immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time
without any conversion thereof, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto.

 



 

Each share of common stock of NCC issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares described in the immediately preceding
paragraph), shall be converted into the right to receive 1.65 shares (the
"Exchange Ratio") of CenterState common stock (the "Merger Consideration") and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares. CenterState shall pay or cause to be
paid to each holder of a fractional share of CenterState common stock, rounded
to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, an amount of cash (without interest
and rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying the
fractional share interest in CenterState common stock to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled by the average closing price of CenterState common
stock as reported on the NASDAQ Stock Market for the twenty (20) consecutive
trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the later of (i)
the day on which the last required regulatory approval for consummation of the
Merger is obtained without regard to any requisite waiting period, or (ii) the
date on which NCC stockholders approve the Merger (the "CenterState Average
Stock Price").

 



 

If the number of shares of CenterState common stock or NCC common stock issued
and outstanding prior to the Effective Time shall be increased or decreased as
a result of a stock split, stock combination, stock dividend, recapitalization
or similar transaction, with respect to such stock, and the record date
therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration shall
be proportionately adjusted as necessary to preserve the relative economic
benefit to CenterState and NCC.

 



 

SECTION 4

 

Stock-Based Awards

 



 

Each valid option to purchase shares of NCC common stock pursuant to the NCC
equity plans (each an "NCC Stock Option"), outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, by virtue of the Merger, be
assumed by CenterState, and automatically and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, be converted into an option to purchase that number of
shares of CenterState common stock as shall equal the product obtained by
multiplying the Exchange Ratio by that number of shares of NCC common stock
which such NCC Stock Option entitled the holder thereof to purchase (rounded
to the nearest whole share), and at an exercise price equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of the NCC Stock Option by
the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest cent); provided, however, that in
the event that the Merger Consideration is modified as a result of the
application of the last paragraph of Section 3 or otherwise, then the Exchange
Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted in order to reflect the impact of such
modification to the Merger Consideration..

 



   

Each outstanding and unexercised warrant to purchase NCC common stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an "NCC Warrant") shall, by
virtue of the Merger, be assumed by CenterState, and automatically and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a right to
purchase shares of NCC common stock and shall be converted into a right to
purchase that number of shares of CenterState common stock as shall equal the
product obtained by multiplying the Exchange Ratio by that number of shares of
NCC common stock which such NCC Warrant entitled the holder thereof to
purchase (rounded to the nearest whole share), and at an exercise price equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of the NCC
Warrant by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest cent); provided,
however, that in the event that the Merger Consideration is modified as a
result of the application of the last paragraph of Section 3 or otherwise,
then the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted in order to reflect
the impact of such modification to the Merger Consideration. 

 



 

At the Effective Time, the deferrals of NCC common stock representing equity
awards and director fees credited to participant accounts under the National
Commerce Corporation Deferral of Compensation Plan (the "NCC Deferred Shares")
shall be converted into the right to receive, within ten (10) days following
the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration in respect of each such NCC
Deferred Share, subject to applicable tax withholding.

 



 

All outstanding performance share awards with respect to shares of NCC common
stock for the four-year performance period ending on December 31, 2018 (the
"2015 Performance Share Awards") shall, in accordance with the applicable NCC
equity plan and award agreements, vest and be issued by NCC as soon as
reasonably practicable after the following dates: (A) for time-based awards,
December 31, 2018, and (B) for performance-based awards, the date of
certification by the Compensation Committee of the NCC board of directors and
confirmation by NCC's independent public accountants, of the extent to which
the performance criteria underlying such awards have been achieved, in
accordance with the applicable award agreements, and in no event later than
March 15, 2019. Such shares, to the extent that they become NCC Deferred
Shares, shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with the preceding paragraph, and to the extent they are instead issued as
shares of NCC common stock and do not become NCC Deferred Shares, shall be
included in the NCC common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with Section 3. In the event that the Effective Time takes place
prior to the certification described above, such 2015 Performance Share Awards
shall be treated in a manner identical to the 2016-2018 Performance Share
Awards, as described below.

 



 

Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding performance share
awards with respect to shares of NCC common stock for the four-year
performance periods ending on December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, all of which
are to be measured over a performance period that will not be completed prior
to the Effective Time (the "2016-2018 Performance Share Awards"), shall vest
as specified in the applicable award agreements (it being understood that the
determination of the number of performance shares earned under the applicable
award agreements, and the extent to which the performance goals have been
achieved for the partial performance period, shall be conclusively determined,
in good faith, by the Compensation Committee of the NCC board of directors, in
accordance with the change in control provisions in the applicable NCC equity
plans and award agreements, as soon as reasonably practicable prior to the
Closing, which determination shall be final and binding on the Parties). Each
of the 2016-2018 Performance Share Awards shall be cancelled at the Effective
Time in exchange for the right to receive, within ten (10) days following the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of NCC
common stock underlying such 2016-2018 Performance Share Awards as determined
pursuant to this Section, subject to applicable tax withholding.

   

SECTION 5

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 



 

5.1Further Assurances. Each party to this Plan of Merger agrees to do such
things as may be reasonably requested by the other party in order to more
effectively consummate or document the transactions contemplated by this Plan
of Merger.

This Agreement shall terminate if and at the time of any termination of the

SECTION 15

prior commitments, arrangements or understandings, both oral and written,
among the Banks with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

 

The provisions of this Agreement are intended to be interpreted and construed
in a manner so as to make such provisions valid, binding and enforceable. In
the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined to be partially
or wholly invalid, illegal or unenforceable, then such provision shall be
deemed to be modified or restricted to the extent necessary to make such
provision valid, binding and enforceable, or, if such provision cannot be
modified or restricted in a manner so as to make such provision valid, binding
and enforceable, then such provision shall be deemed to be excised from this
Agreement and the validity, binding effect and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired in any manner.

 

No waiver, amendment, modification or change of any provision of this
Agreement shall be effective unless and until made in writing and signed by
the Banks. No waiver, forbearance or failure by any Bank of its rights to
enforce any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver or estoppel
of such Bank's right to enforce any other provision of this Agreement or a
continuing waiver by such Bank of compliance with any provision hereof.

 

Except to the extent Federal law is applicable, this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the
State of Florida without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.

 

This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the Banks' respective successors and permitted assigns. Unless
otherwise expressly stated herein, this Agreement shall not benefit or create
any right of action in or on behalf of any person or entity other than the
Banks.

 

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (including by facsimile or
optically‑scanned electronic mail attachment), each of which shall be deemed
to be original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

NON-COMPETITION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

 

This Non-Competition and Non-Disclosure Agreement (the "Agreement"), is
entered into as of the 23rd day of November, 2018, by and between CenterState
Bank Corporation, a Florida corporation ("CenterState"), and the undersigned
individual ("Director").

 

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
November 23, 2018 (the "Merger Agreement") by and between CenterState and
National Commerce Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("NCC"), NCC will merge
with and into CenterState (the "Merger"), as a result of which National Bank
of Commerce, a national banking association and wholly-owned subsidiary of NCC
("NBC"), will merge with and into CenterState Bank, N.A., a national banking
association and wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterState ("CenterState Bank");

 

WHEREAS, Director is a stockholder of NCC and, as a result of the Merger and
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Director is
expected to receive significant consideration in exchange for the shares of
NCC common stock held by Director;

 

WHEREAS, prior to the date hereof, Director has served as a member of the
board of directors of NCC and/or NBC, and, therefore, Director has knowledge
of the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets (each as hereinafter
defined);

 

WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger, CenterState will succeed to all of the
Confidential Information and Trade Secrets, for which CenterState, as of the
Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), will have paid valuable
consideration and desires reasonable protection; and

 

WHEREAS, it is a material prerequisite to the consummation of the Merger that
certain directors of NCC and NBC, including Director, enter into this
Agreement;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and the mutual covenants
and undertakings herein contained, CenterState and Director, each intending to
be legally bound, covenant and agree as follows:

 

1.Restrictive Covenants. 

 

(a)Director acknowledges that (i) CenterState has separately bargained for the
restrictive covenants in this Agreement; and (ii) the types and periods of
restrictions imposed by the covenants in this Agreement are fair and
reasonable to Director and such restrictions will not prevent Director from
earning a livelihood.

 

(b)Having acknowledged the foregoing, solely in the event that the Merger is
consummated, Director covenants and agrees with CenterState as follows:

 

(i)From and after the Effective Time, Director will not disclose or use any
Confidential Information (other than Trade Secrets) for a period of two (2)
years from the Effective Time or Trade Secrets for so long as they remain
Trade Secrets, except for any disclosure that is required by applicable law or
court order. In the event that Director is required by law or court order to
disclose any Confidential Information, Director will: (A) if and to the extent
permitted by such law or court order, provide CenterState with prompt notice
of such requirement prior to the

   

disclosure so that CenterState may waive the requirements of this Agreement or
seek an appropriate protective order at CenterState's sole expense; and (B)
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that any Confidential
Information disclosed will be accorded confidential treatment. If, in the
absence of a waiver or protective order, Director is nonetheless, in the
opinion of his or her counsel, required to disclose Confidential Information,
disclosure may be made only as to that portion of the Confidential Information
that counsel advises Director is required to be disclosed. Nothing contained
in this Agreement limits the Director's ability to file a charge or complaint
with, communicate with (except with respect to information covered by 17
C.F.R. 240.21F-4(b)(4)(i) or 17 C.F.R. 240.21F-4(b)(4)(ii), which relate to
legal representation), or otherwise participate in any investigation or
proceeding that may be conducted by (i) the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (the "EEOC") or the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
or (ii) any other federal, state or local governmental agency or commission
that has jurisdiction over CenterState or any of its subsidiaries or
affiliates (the "Government Agencies") if and to the extent that it is not
permitted by applicable law to limit the Director's ability to file such a
charge or complaint with, communicate with, or otherwise participate in any
investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by such Government Agency;
in each such case, including by providing documents or other information,
without notice to CenterState or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. This
Agreement does not limit the Director's right to receive an award for
information provided to (1) the SEC or (2) the EEOC or any other Government
Agency, if and to the extent that it is not permissible by law to limit the
Director's right to receive an award for information provided to the EEOC or
such other Government Agency. In addition, pursuant to the Defend Trade
Secrets Act of 2016, the Director understands that an individual may not be
held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law
for the disclosure of a trade secret that (i) is made (A) in confidence to a
federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or
to an attorney; and (B) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a
suspected violation of law; or (ii) is made in a complaint or other document
that is filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding. Further, an
individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a
suspected violation of law may disclose the employer\'s trade secrets to the
attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding if the
individual (y) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and
(z) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

 

(ii)Except as expressly provided on Schedule I to this Agreement, for a period
beginning at the Effective Time and ending two (2) years after the Effective
Time, Director will not (except on behalf of or with the prior written consent
of CenterState), on Director's own behalf or in the service or on behalf of
others, solicit or attempt to solicit any individual or entity that is known
by Director to be a customer of CenterState, CenterState Bank, NCC or NBC
(each a "Protected Party"), including known actively sought prospective
customers of NBC as of the Effective Time, for the purpose of providing
banking products or services that are Competitive (as hereinafter defined)
with those offered or provided by any Protected Party.

 

(iii)Except as expressly provided on Schedule I to this Agreement, for a
period beginning at the Effective Time and ending two (2) years after the
Effective Time, Director will not (except on behalf of or with the prior
written consent of CenterState), either directly or indirectly, on Director's
own behalf or in the service or on behalf of others, act as a director,
manager, officer or employee of any business which is the same as or
essentially the same as the business conducted by any Protected Party and
which has an office located within the Restricted Territory (as hereinafter
defined).

 

(iv)For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending two (2) years
after the Effective Time, Director will not on Director's own behalf or in the
service or on behalf of others, solicit, recruit or hire, or attempt to
solicit, recruit or hire, directly or by assisting others, any individual who
is known by Director to be an employee of any Protected Party or to have been

   

an employee of any Protected Party within one year prior to such activity,
whether or not such employee is a full-time employee, whether or not such
employment is pursuant to a written agreement, and whether or not such
employment is for a determined period or is at will, to cease working for such
Protected Party; provided that the foregoing will not prevent the placement of
any general solicitation for employment not specifically directed towards
employees of any Protected Party or hiring any such person as a result
thereof.

 

(c)For purposes of this Section 1, the following terms shall be defined as set
forth below:

 

(i)"Competitive," with respect to particular products or services, shall mean
products or services that are the same as or substantially similar to the
products or services of any Protected Party.

 

(ii)"Confidential Information" shall mean data and information:

 

(A)relating to the business of NCC and its subsidiaries, including NBC, or the
business of CenterState or its subsidiaries, including CenterState Bank,
regardless of whether the data or information constitutes a Trade Secret;

 

(B)disclosed to Director or of which Director became aware as a consequence of
Director's relationship with NCC and/or NBC;

 

(C)having value to NCC and/or NBC and, as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, CenterState and CenterState
Bank; and

 

(D)not generally known to competitors of NCC or CenterState.

 

Confidential Information shall include Trade Secrets (as hereinafter defined),
methods of operation, names of customers, price lists, financial information
and projections, personnel data and similar information; provided, however,
that the terms "Confidential Information" and "Trade Secrets" shall not mean
data or information that (x) has been disclosed to the public, except where
such public disclosure has been made by Director without authorization from
NCC or CenterState, (y) has been independently developed and disclosed by
others, or (z) has otherwise entered the public domain through lawful means.

 

(iii)"Restricted Territory" shall mean each county in Florida, Georgia, or
Alabama where NBC operates a banking office at the Effective Time and each
county contiguous to each of such counties.

 

(iv)"Trade Secrets" shall mean information, without regard to form, including
technical or nontechnical data, formulas, patterns, compilations, programs,
devices, methods, techniques, drawings, processes, financial data, financial
plans, product plans or a list of actual or potential customers or suppliers,
that is not commonly known by or available to the public and which
information:

 

(A)derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known
to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who
can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and

 

(B)is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to
maintain its secrecy.

   

(d)Director acknowledges that irreparable loss and injury would result to
CenterState upon the breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section
1 and that damages arising out of such breach would be difficult to ascertain.
Director hereby agrees that, in addition to all other remedies provided at law
or in equity, CenterState may petition and obtain from a court of law or
equity, without the necessity of proving actual damages and without posting
any bond or other security, both temporary and permanent injunctive relief to
prevent a breach by Director of any covenant contained in this Section 1, and
shall be entitled to an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits and
other benefits arising out of any such breach. In the event that the
provisions of this Section 1 should ever be determined to exceed the time,
geographic or other limitations permitted by applicable law, then such
provisions shall be modified so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent
permitted by law. If such provision(s) cannot be modified to be enforceable,
the provision(s) shall be severed from this Agreement to the extent
unenforceable. The remaining provisions and any partially enforceable
provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

 

2.Term; Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time by the
written consent of the parties hereto, and this Agreement shall be
automatically terminated upon the earlier of (a) termination of the Merger
Agreement, (b) two (2) years following the Effective Time, or (c) upon a
Change in Control of CenterState. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions
of Section 1 shall only become operative upon the consummation of the Merger
but, in such event, shall survive the consummation of the Merger until the
earlier of two (2) years after the Effective Time or a Change in Control of
CenterState. Upon termination of this Agreement, no party shall have any
further obligations or liabilities hereunder, except that termination of this
Agreement will not relieve a breaching party from liability for any breach of
any provision of this Agreement occurring prior to the termination of this
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control of
CenterState" means (a) any person or group of persons within the meaning of
§13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, becomes the
beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 50% or more of the (1)
outstanding voting securities of CenterState or CenterState Bank, or (2) the
assets of CenterState or CenterState Bank, taken as a whole, or (b)
individuals serving on the board of directors of CenterState as of the
Effective Time cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the
board of directors of CenterState (the "Incumbent Board"), provided that any
person becoming a director subsequent to the Effective Time whose election was
approved by a vote of at least three-quarters of the directors comprising the
Incumbent Board, or whose nomination for election by CenterState's
shareholders was approved by the nominating committee serving under an
Incumbent Board, shall be considered a member of the Incumbent Board.

 

3.Notices. Any notice, consent, demand, request or other communication given
to a party hereto in connection with this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be deemed to have been given to such party (a) when delivered personally
to such party or (b) provided that a written acknowledgment of receipt is
obtained, five (5) days after being sent by prepaid certified or registered
mail, or (c) two (2) days after being sent by a nationally recognized
overnight courier, to the address (if any) specified below for such party (or
to such other address as such party shall have specified by ten (10) days'
advance notice given in accordance with this Section 3).

other party shall be deemed a waiver of dissimilar provisions or conditions at

them (individually and collectively, the "Released Parties") of and from any
and all liabilities, claims, demands, debts, accounts, covenants, agreements,
obligations, costs, expenses, actions, causes of action or other rights of
every nature, character or description (collectively, "Claims"), which the
undersigned, solely in his or her capacity as an officer, director or employee
of any NCC Entity, has or claims to have, or previously had or claimed to
have, in each case as of the Effective Time, against any of the Released
Parties, whether or not in law, equity or otherwise, based in whole or in part
on any facts, conduct, activities, transactions, events or occurrences
occurring prior to the Effective Time, whether known or unknown, matured or
unmatured, contingent or otherwise (individually, a "Released Claim," and
collectively, the "Released Claims"), except for (i) Claims for compensation

(vi)Claims solely to the extent arising from facts, conduct, activities,
transactions or events occurring (in each case) after the Effective Time; or

3.Forbearance. The undersigned shall forever refrain and forebear from
commencing, instituting or prosecuting any lawsuit, action, claim or
proceeding before or in any court, regulatory, governmental, arbitral or other
authority to collect or enforce any Released Claims which are released and
discharged hereby.

 

4.Miscellaneous.

 

(a)This letter shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Florida (without regard for the conflicts of law principles
thereof).

 

(b)This letter contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Released Claims released hereby, and this letter supersedes all prior
agreements, arrangement or understandings (written or otherwise) with respect
to such Released Claims and no representation or warranty, oral or written,
express or implied, has been made by or relied upon by any party hereto,
except as expressly contained herein or in the Merger Agreement.

 

(c) In the event that any one or more provisions of this letter shall for any
reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by any court
of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provisions of this letter, and the parties shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to substitute a valid, legal and
enforceable provision which, insofar as practical, implements the purpose and
intents of this letter. 

   

(d)This letter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
undersigned and the Released Parties and their respective heirs, legal
representatives, successors and assigns.

 

(e)This letter may not be modified, amended or rescinded except by the written

understanding of the undersigned and the Released Parties that no term hereof
may be waived by the action, inaction or course of delaying by or between the
undersigned or the Released Parties, except in strict accordance with this
paragraph, and further that the waiver of any breach of this letter shall not
constitute or be construed as the waiver of any other breach of the terms
hereof.

 

(f)The undersigned represents, warrants and covenants that the undersigned is
fully aware of the undersigned's rights to discuss any and all aspects of this
matter with any attorney chosen by him or her, and that the undersigned has
carefully read and fully understands all the provisions of this letter, and
that the undersigned is voluntarily entering into this letter.

 

(g)This letter shall become effective upon the consummation of the Merger, and
its operation to extinguish all of the Released Claims released hereby is not
dependent on or affected by the performance or non-performance of any future
act by the undersigned or the Released Parties (other than the failure of
CenterState to pay the Merger Consideration under the Merger Agreement). If
the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason, this letter shall be of no
force or effect.

 

(h)If any civil action, arbitration or other legal proceeding is brought for
the enforcement of this letter, or because of an alleged dispute, breach,
default or misrepresentation in connection with any provision of this letter,
the successful or prevailing party or parties shall be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, sales and use taxes and all expenses

and post‑judgment proceedings), incurred in that proceeding, in addition to
any other relief to which such party or parties may be entitled. Attorneys'
fees shall include, without limitation, paralegal fees, investigative fees,
administrative costs, sales and use taxes and all other charges billed by the
attorney to the prevailing party (including any fees and costs associated with
collecting such amounts).

 

(i)IN ANY CIVIL ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM, PROCEEDING, OR LITIGATION, WHETHER AT
LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHICH ARISES OUT OF, CONCERNS, OR RELATES TO THIS CLAIMS
LETTER, ANY AND ALL TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS CLAIMS LETTER, THE
PERFORMANCE OF THIS CLAIMS LETTER, OR THE RELATIONSHIP CREATED BY THIS CLAIMS
LETTER, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE,
TRIAL SHALL BE TO A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION AND NOT TO A JURY. EACH

LETTER OF THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. NEITHER PARTY HAS MADE
OR RELIED UPON ANY ORAL REPRESENTATIONS TO OR BY ANY OTHER PARTY REGARDING THE

Pursuant to

 

Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(c)(3)

 

[•], 2019

 

This certificate is provided pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-2(c)(3) and Section 5.27 of the Merger Agreement (as defined below) to
inform CenterState Bank Corporation ("CenterState"), that withholding of tax
is not required upon the acquisition of an interest in National Commerce
Corporation ("NCC"), as part of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of November 23, 2018, by
and between CenterState and NCC. The undersigned hereby certifies the
following on behalf of NCC:

 

In accordance with U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.897-2(h), NCC is not,
as of the date hereof, a "United States real property holding corporation" (a
"USRPHC"), as such term is defined by Section 897(c)(2) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, and has not been a USRPHC on any determination date during the
five-year period ending on the date hereof. Accordingly, interests in NCC do
not constitute "U.S. real property interests."

 

NCC understands that this certification may be disclosed to the Internal
Revenue Service by CenterState and that any false statement contained herein
could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.

Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have examined this certification
and that to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct, and
complete, and I further declare that I have authority to sign this document on
behalf of NCC.
