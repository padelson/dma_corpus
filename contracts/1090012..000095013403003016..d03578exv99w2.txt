         THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of
February 23, 2003, is among Devon Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Devon NewCo Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct and
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Ocean Energy, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company").

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company have determined that the merger of Merger Sub with and into
the Company (the "Merger"), in the manner contemplated herein, is advisable and
in the best interests of their respective corporations and stockholders, and, by
resolutions duly adopted, have approved this Agreement;

         WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Code"); and

         WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1
                                   THE MERGER

         Section 1.1 THE MERGER. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall
be merged with and into the Company in accordance with this Agreement, and the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company
(sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation") shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger and shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the Delaware General
Corporation Law ("DGCL"). At the election of Parent, any direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent may be substituted for Merger Sub as a constituent
corporation in the Merger at any time prior to the meetings of each of the
Company's and the Parent's stockholders contemplated by Section 5.4 so long as
such substitution does not delay either such meeting.

         Section 1.2 THE CLOSING. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place (a) at the
offices of Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw, 700 Louisiana Street, Houston, Texas 77002,
at 9:00 a.m., local time, on the first business day immediately following the
day on which the last to be fulfilled or waived of the conditions set forth in
Article 6 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall
be fulfilled or waived in accordance herewith or (b) at such other time, date or
place as Parent and the Company may agree in writing. The date on which the
Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date."



                                       1

<PAGE>

         Section 1.3 EFFECTIVE TIME. If all the conditions to the Merger set
forth in Article 6 shall have been fulfilled or waived in accordance herewith
and this Agreement shall not have been terminated as provided in Article 7, on
the Closing Date, a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") meeting
the requirements of Section 251 of the DGCL shall be properly executed and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL, or at such later
time that the parties hereto shall have agreed upon and designated in such
filing as the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time").

         Section 1.4 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION. At the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended to read as set
forth in Exhibit A attached hereto, and as so amended shall be the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until duly amended in accordance
with applicable law.

         Section 1.5 BYLAWS. The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation,
until duly amended in accordance with applicable law.

         Section 1.6 BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF SURVIVING CORPORATION. The Board of
Directors of the Surviving Corporation shall consist of the Board of Directors
of Merger Sub, as it existed immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
changed in accordance with applicable law. Each of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Company shall tender his or her resignation as a director of
the Company, to be effective at the Effective Time.

         Section 1.7 BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF PARENT. At the Effective Time, the
Board of Directors of Parent shall consist of such number of persons as may be
determined by Parent. If the Board of Directors of Parent is to consist of 13
directors at the Effective Time, Parent shall, except as provided otherwise in
this Section 1.7, cause the four persons from the Company's Board of Directors
designated in writing by the Company no later than March 10, 2003 to be
appointed to the Board of Directors of Parent at the Effective Time; provided,
however, that if the Board of Directors of Parent will consist of more or less
than 13 directors immediately after the Effective Time, then Parent shall cause
a number of persons designated in writing by the Company (and from the Company's
Board of Directors as existing on the date hereof) equal to four-thirteenths of
the total number of directors (rounded upward to the nearest whole number) to be
included on the Board of Directors of Parent at the Effective Time. The persons
designated by the Company for inclusion on the Board of Directors of Parent
pursuant to this Section 1.7 are referred to herein as the "Company Designees".
Parent shall notify the Company if the number of directors constituting the
Board of Directors at the Effective Time will be more or less than 13 directors.
If the number of directors to be designated by the Company pursuant to this
Section 1.7 is less than four, then Parent shall cause the Company Designees to
be appointed in the order designated by the Company. If the number of directors
to be designated by the Company pursuant to this Section 1.7 is greater than
four directors, the Company shall provide Parent with written notice of the
additional individuals designated to serve as Company Designees. The Company
shall provide Parent the information concerning each Company Designee that would
be required to be included in a proxy statement under Regulation 14A of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). If



                                       2

<PAGE>

Parent determines in its sole discretion that any Company Designee is
unacceptable to Parent, Parent and the Company will agree upon a substitute
Company Designee from the Company's Board of Directors as soon as practicable
and in any event prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as
defined in Section 5.8). The Company Designees shall be allocated as evenly as
possible among the different classes of Parent directors, but otherwise at
Parent's discretion; provided, however, that, in the event there are four or
more Company Designees and except as provided in the following sentence, the
term of one Company Designee may expire at Parent's annual meeting held in 2004
and the terms of the remaining Company Designees shall expire at Parent's annual
meeting held in 2005 and 2006. If the Effective Time occurs prior to Parent's
annual meeting held in 2003, the Company Designee(s) who would have been
appointed to a term expiring at Parent's annual meeting held in 2006 under the
immediately preceding sentence shall instead be appointed to a term expiring at
Parent's annual meeting held in 2003 and shall be nominated for election at that
meeting to a term expiring at Parent's annual meeting held in 2006.

         Section 1.8 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF PARENT. At the Effective Time, the
Executive Officers of Parent shall include Larry J. Nichols, who shall serve as
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and James T. Hackett, who
shall serve as President and Chief Operating Officer (in each case assuming he
is willing and able to serve).

                                    ARTICLE 2
                          CONVERSION OF COMPANY SHARES

         Section 2.1 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the following effects on the capital stock of the Company and Merger
Sub, without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the
Company or Merger Sub:

         (a) Conversion of the Company Common Shares. Subject to the provisions
of this Section 2.1, each share of Common Stock, $0.10 par value per share, of
the Company (each a "Company Common Share" and collectively the "Company Common
Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (but not
including any Company Common Shares that are owned (i) by Parent, Merger Sub or
any other direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent or (ii) by the Company or any
direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company (the "Excluded Company Shares"))
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into 0.414 of a share (the "Exchange Ratio") of Parent
Common Stock (the "Merger Consideration"). "Parent Common Stock" shall mean the
common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of Parent.

         (b) Company Preferred Shares. Each share of Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value per share, of the Company (each, a "Company
Preferred Share," and collectively the "Company Preferred Shares;" and,
together, the Company Common Shares and the Company Preferred Shares are
collectively referred to herein as the "Company Shares"), other than Appraisal
Shares (as defined in Section 2.3), issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as one share of Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. From
and after the Effective Time, all shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock of the Surviving Corporation then outstanding shall be convertible into
Parent Common Stock instead of Company Common Shares in



                                       3

<PAGE>

accordance with the terms of the certificate of designations governing such
series, giving effect to the Exchange Ratio.

         (c) Cancellation of Excluded Company Shares. Each Excluded Company
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
no longer be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

         (d) Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall thereby become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

         (e) Stock Options; Employee Benefit Plans. At the Effective Time, all
Stock Options (as defined in Section 5.14) outstanding at the Effective Time
under each Company Plan (as defined in Section 3.11) shall be assumed by Parent
in accordance with Section 5.14.

         Section 2.2 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES.

         (a) Exchange Procedures. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit with such party as may be reasonably satisfactory to Parent and
the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), in trust for the benefit of the holders of
Company Common Shares, certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock
required to effect the conversion of the Company Common Shares into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (including shares of Parent Common
Stock that are needed with respect to fractional shares as contemplated by
Section 2.2(d)). Parent shall make sufficient funds available to the Exchange
Agent from time to time as needed to pay cash in respect of dividends or other
distributions in accordance with Section 2.2(b). Promptly after the Effective
Time, but in no event later than three business days following the Closing Date,
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record as of the Effective Time of a certificate representing Company Common
Shares (each a "Certificate") (other than holders of a Certificate in respect of
Excluded Company Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery of
the Certificates shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and to have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions
for exchanging the Certificates and receiving the Merger Consideration to which
such holder shall be entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(a). Subject to Section
2.2(g), upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) a certificate
representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder
is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and (ii) a check in the
aggregate amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) of (A)
any cash in lieu of fractional shares determined in accordance with Section
2.2(d) plus (B) any cash dividends and any other dividends or other
distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 2.2. The Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable (for
fractional shares, dividends or otherwise) upon surrender of any Certificate. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares that



                                       4

<PAGE>

occurred prior to the Effective Time, but is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued and/or paid to
such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Company Common
Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required
to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common
Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such
exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates for shares of
Parent Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent or the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

         (b) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. Whenever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of Parent Common
Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends
or other distributions so declared in respect of such Parent Common Stock shall
be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate is
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.2. Subject to the
effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be issued or paid, less the amount of any withholding taxes that may be
required thereon, to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such Certificate, without interest,
(i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a
record date that is at or after the Effective Time and a payment date on or
prior to the date of surrender of such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and
not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock with a record date at or after the Effective Time but with a payment date
subsequent to surrender. No interest shall be payable with respect to any
amounts to be paid under this Section 2.2. For purposes of dividends or other
distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time.

         (c) Transfers. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Company of the Company Common Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

         (d) Fractional Shares.

                  (i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
         Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued
         upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or upon conversion of
         shares, and such fractional share interest shall not entitle the owner
         thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of Parent.

                  (ii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time,
         the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (A) the aggregate
         number of shares of Parent Common Stock that would be distributed to
         holders of the Certificates pursuant to Section 2.1(a) if no effect
         were given to Section 2.2(d)(i) over (B) the aggregate number



                                       5

<PAGE>

         of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to holders of
         the Certificates pursuant Section 2.1(a) taking into account the effect
         of Section 2.2(d)(i) (such excess, the "Excess Shares"). As soon as
         practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for
         the holders of the Certificates, shall sell the Excess Shares at
         then-prevailing prices on the American Stock Exchange ("AMEX"), all in
         the manner provided in Section 2.2(d)(iii).

                  (iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent
         shall be executed on the AMEX and shall be executed in round lots to
         the extent practicable. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
         commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs,
         including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred
         in connection with such sale of the Excess Shares. Until the proceeds
         of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of the
         Certificates (or paid to Parent pursuant to Section 2.2(e)), the
         Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of the
         Certificates (the "Common Stock Trust"). The Exchange Agent shall
         determine the portion of the Common Stock Trust to which each holder of
         a Certificate shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of
         the aggregate net proceeds comprising the Common Stock Trust by a
         fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share
         interest in the Parent Common Stock to which such holder of a
         Certificate is entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate
         amount of fractional share interests in the Parent Common Stock to
         which all holders of the Certificates are entitled. Parent shall comply
         with the provisions of Rule 236(c) under the Securities Act of 1933, as
         amended (the "Securities Act").

                  (iv) As soon as practicable after the determination of the
         amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Certificates in lieu
         of any fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall make
         available such amounts, without interest, to such holders of
         Certificates that have surrendered their Certificates in accordance
         with this Section 2.2.

         (e) Termination of Exchange Period; Unclaimed Merger Consideration. Any
shares of Parent Common Stock, any portion of the Common Stock Trust and any
portion of the cash, dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent
Common Stock deposited by Parent with the Exchange Agent (including the proceeds
of any investments thereof) that remain unclaimed by the former stockholders of
the Company one year after the Effective Time shall be transferred to Parent.
Any former stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with
this Section 2.2 shall thereafter be entitled to look only to Parent for payment
of their Merger Consideration and any cash, dividends and other distributions in
respect thereof issuable and/or payable pursuant to Section 2.1, Section 2.2(b)
and Section 2.2(d) upon due surrender of their Certificates, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to
any former holder of Company Common Shares for any amount properly delivered to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to
the date on which any Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the
property of any governmental entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.



                                       6

<PAGE>

         (f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, and if Parent believes that the Person providing the
indemnity is sufficiently creditworthy, the making of a reasonable undertaking
to indemnify Parent or the Company, or, if Parent does not so believe, the
posting by such Person of a bond in the form customarily required by Parent to
indemnify against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, Parent will issue the shares of Parent Common Stock and the
Exchange Agent will distribute such Merger Consideration, dividends and other
distributions in respect thereof issuable or payable in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate pursuant to Section 2.1, Section 2.2(b) and
Section 2.2(d), in each case, without interest. Any delivery or surrender for
exchange of a Certificate pursuant to this Section 2.2 may be effected (in lieu
of such delivery or exchange for surrender of a Certificate) by delivery of an
affidavit together with an indemnity undertaking or indemnity bond in accordance
with this Section 2.2(f).

         (g) Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Certificates surrendered for exchange by any Rule 145 Affiliate (as
determined pursuant to Section 5.11) of the Company shall not be exchanged until
Parent has received a written agreement from such Person as provided in Section
5.11.

         Section 2.3 APPRAISAL RIGHTS. The parties hereto agree that, in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights will be available
to holders of Company Common Shares in connection with the Merger.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Preferred
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are
held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such shares (the "Appraisal Shares") pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall
be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist or be outstanding, and each
holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine
that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Appraisal Shares
under Section 262 shall cease to exist and such Appraisal Shares shall remain
outstanding as provided in Section 2.1(b). The Company shall serve prompt notice
to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any Company Preferred Shares, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in and, subject to applicable law,
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to, settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

         Section 2.4 ADJUSTMENTS. In the event that prior to the Effective Time,
there shall have been declared or effected a stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend or stock distribution (including any dividend, or distribution,
of securities convertible into Company Common Shares or Parent Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or



                                       7

<PAGE>

similar event made with respect to the Company Common Shares or the Parent
Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the
appropriate effect of such event.

                                   ARTICLE 3
                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

         Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to Parent
concurrently with the execution hereof (the "Company Disclosure Letter") or as
disclosed with reasonable specificity in the Company Reports (as defined in
Section 3.7), the Company represents and warrants to Parent that:

         Section 3.1 EXISTENCE; GOOD STANDING; CORPORATE AUTHORITY. The Company
is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company is duly qualified to do business
as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each
jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it
therein or in which the transaction of its business makes such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have or
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.9). The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties
and to carry on its business as now conducted. The copies of the Company's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws previously made available to Parent are
true and correct and contain all amendments as of the date hereof.

         Section 3.2 AUTHORIZATION, VALIDITY AND EFFECT OF AGREEMENTS. The
Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and all other agreements and documents contemplated hereby to
which it is a party. The consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action,
other than, with respect to the Merger, the adoption of this Agreement by the
Company's stockholders. This Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws relating to
creditors' rights and general principles of equity.

         Section 3.3 CAPITALIZATION. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 520,000,000 Company Common Shares, and 10,000,000 Company Preferred
Shares. As of February 20, 2003, there were (a) 177,405,787 Company Common
Shares issued and outstanding, (b) 50,000 Company Preferred Shares issued and
outstanding and (c) 19,661,271 Company Common Shares subject to outstanding
employee and director stock options issued pursuant to the stock option plans of
the Company described in the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Company Option
Plans"), of which the weighted average exercise price was approximately $16.26
per share and (d) 1,500,000 unissued shares of preferred stock designated as
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock ("Company Series A Preferred
Stock"). All issued and outstanding Company Shares (i) are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, (ii)
were not issued in violation of the terms of any agreement or other
understanding binding upon the Company and (iii) were issued in compliance with
all applicable charter documents of the Company and all applicable federal and
state securities laws, rules and regulations. As of the date hereof, one right
to purchase Series A Junior Participating



                                       8

<PAGE>

Preferred Stock of the Company (each, a "Company Right") issued pursuant to the
Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated December 12, 1997 (as amended, the
"Company Rights Agreement"), between the Company and Fleet National Bank (f/k/a
BankBoston, N.A.) is associated with and attached to each outstanding Company
Common Share. Except (i) as set forth in this Section 3.3, (ii) for any Company
Common Shares issuable upon conversion of Company Preferred Shares, (iii) for
any Company Common Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of the options
referred to in subsection (c) above, (iv) for options issued under the Company
Option Plans after the date of this Agreement in compliance with Section 5.1(a)
and Company Common Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of such options and
(v) for shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock and Company Common Shares
issuable pursuant to the Company Rights, there are no outstanding shares of
capital stock and there are no options, warrants, calls, subscriptions,
shareholder rights plan or similar instruments, convertible securities, or other
rights, agreements or commitments which obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company has no
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which
have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company on any
matter.

         Section 3.4 SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Significant Subsidiary" shall mean a significant subsidiary as defined in Rule
1-02 of Regulation S-X of the Exchange Act. Each of the Company's Significant
Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited liability company or partnership duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing (where applicable) under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has the corporate,
limited liability company or partnership power and authority to own, operate and
lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing (where applicable)
in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, operation or lease of its property
or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except for
jurisdictions in which such failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing
would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each of the Company's
Significant Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company free and
clear of all liens, pledges, security interests, claims, preferential purchase
rights or other rights, interests or encumbrances ("Liens"). Schedule 3.4 of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth for each Significant Subsidiary of the
Company, its name and jurisdiction of incorporation or organization.

         Section 3.5 NO VIOLATION. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is, or has received notice that it would be with the passage of
time, in violation of any term, condition or provision of (a) its charter
documents or bylaws, (b) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license or other instrument or (c) any
order of any court, governmental authority or arbitration board or tribunal, or
any law, ordinance, governmental rule or regulation to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets is subject,
or is delinquent with respect to any report required to be filed with any
governmental entity, except, in the case of matters described in clause (b) or
(c), as would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company



                                       9

<PAGE>

Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not have or reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i)
the Company and its Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances,
exemptions, orders, franchises and approvals of all governmental authorities
necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the "Company
Permits") and (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the
terms of the Company Permits. No investigation by any governmental authority
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, other than those that would not have or
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 3.6 NO CONFLICT.

         (a) Neither the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement
nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the terms hereof will: (i) conflict with or result in a breach
of any provisions of the charter documents or bylaws of the Company; (ii)
violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or
constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of
termination or cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under, or
accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the properties of the Company or its Subsidiaries under, or result
in being declared void, voidable, or without further binding effect, or
otherwise result in a detriment to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, Company Permit, lease, contract, agreement, joint
venture or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their properties is bound or affected; or (iii) contravene or conflict
with or constitute a violation of any provision of any law, rule, regulation,
judgment, order or decree binding upon or applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of matters described in clause (ii) or
(iii), as would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) Neither the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement
nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the terms hereof will require any consent, approval or
authorization of, or filing or registration with, any governmental or regulatory
authority, other than (i) the filings provided for in Article 1 and (ii) filings
required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the "HSR Act"), the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or applicable
state securities and "Blue Sky" laws and applicable foreign competition or
antitrust laws ((i) and (ii) collectively, the "Regulatory Filings"), except for
any consent, approval or authorization the failure of which to obtain and for
any filing or registration the failure of which to make would not have or
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

         (c) Other than as contemplated by Section 3.6(b), no consents,
assignments, waivers, authorizations or other certificates are necessary in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby to provide for the
continuation in full force and effect of all of the Company's material contracts
or leases or for the Company to consummate the transactions



                                       10

<PAGE>

contemplated hereby, except where the failure to receive such consents or other
certificates would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

         (d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will: (i) result in any
payment from the Company or its Subsidiaries (including severance, unemployment
compensation, parachute payment, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to any
director, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any Company Plan (as defined in Section 3.11) or otherwise;
(ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Plan or
otherwise; or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting
of any such benefits.

         Section 3.7 SEC DOCUMENTS. The Company has made available to Parent
each registration statement, report, proxy statement or information statement
(other than preliminary materials) filed by the Company with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") since January 1, 2001, each in the form (including
exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof
(collectively, the "Company Reports"), and the Company has filed all forms,
reports and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC pursuant to
relevant securities statutes, regulations, policies and rules since such time.
As of their respective dates, the Company Reports (i) were prepared in
accordance with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder and complied with the then
applicable accounting requirements and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading except for such
statements, if any, as have been modified by subsequent filings with the SEC
prior to the date hereof. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes
and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of its date and each
of the consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and stockholders'
equity included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports
(including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material
respects the results of operations, cash flows or changes in stockholders'
equity, as the case may be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods
set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to such
exceptions as may be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), in each case in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied
during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein.

         Section 3.8 LITIGATION AND LIABILITIES. There are no actions, suits or
proceedings pending against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the
Company's knowledge, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
at law or in equity, or before or by any federal, state or foreign commission,
court, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, other than those that would not
have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. There are no outstanding judgments, decrees,
injunctions, awards or orders against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
other than those that would not have or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. There are
no obligations or liabilities of any nature, whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise, of the Company or any of its



                                       11

<PAGE>

Subsidiaries, other than those liabilities and obligations (a) that are
disclosed in the Company Reports, (b) that have been incurred in the ordinary

Contract is in full force and effect, and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of
the Company, each of the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors' rights and
general principles of equity and except where the failure of any Company
Material Contract to be a legal, valid and binding obligation and enforceable in
accordance with its terms would not have or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Adverse Effect. No condition exists
or event has occurred which (whether with or without notice or lapse of time or
both) would constitute a default by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or,
to the knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto under any Company
Material Contract or result in a right of termination of any Company Material
Contract, except for any condition or event that would not have or reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Adverse Effect.

         (b) Set forth in Schedule 3.19(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter is,

2003.

         (c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into
any contract and there is no commitment, judgment, injunction, order or decree
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or subject to that
has or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or
impairing the conduct of business by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any contract that may be terminable as a result of Parent's status as a
competitor of any party to such contract, except, in each case, for any
prohibition, impairment or termination right that would not have or reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the character of the
properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its
business makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so

Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to
own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now

Parent of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, has been duly
authorized by all requisite corporate action, other than, with respect to the
Merger, the approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the

                  (vi) There has been no exposure of any person or property to
         Hazardous Materials in connection with Parent's, Merger Sub's, or their
         Subsidiaries' operations, assets, businesses, and Parent Real
         Properties that would reasonably be expected to form the basis for a
         claim for damages or compensation; and

                  (vii) Parent, Merger Sub, and their Subsidiaries have made
         available to the Company complete and correct copies of all material
         environmental site assessment reports, studies, and correspondence on
         environmental matters (in each instance relevant to the Parent, Merger
         Sub or their Subsidiaries) that are in Parent's, Merger Sub's, or their
         Subsidiaries' possession and relating to their respective operations,
         assets, businesses and Parent Real Properties.

         None of Parent, Merger Sub, or their Subsidiaries make any
representation or warranty regarding compliance or failure to comply with, or
any actual or contingent liability under, any Environmental Law, except as
expressly set forth in this Section 4.13.

         Section 4.14 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Parent and its Subsidiaries own or
possess all necessary licenses or other valid rights to use all patents, patent
rights, trademarks, trademark rights and proprietary information used or held
for use in connection with their respective businesses as currently being
conducted, free and clear of material Liens, except where the failure to own or
possess such licenses and other rights would not have or reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and
there are no assertions or claims challenging the validity of any of the
foregoing which would have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except in the ordinary course
of business, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted to any other
person any license to use any of the foregoing. The conduct of Parent's and its
Subsidiaries' respective businesses as currently conducted does not conflict
with any patents, patent rights, licenses, trademarks, trademark rights, trade
names, trade name rights or copyrights of others in a way which would have or
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. There is no infringement of any proprietary right owned
by or licensed by or to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in a way which would
have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.15 TITLE TO PROPERTIES. Except for goods and other property
sold, used or otherwise disposed of since September 30, 2002 in the ordinary
course of business for fair value, as of the date hereof, Parent has defensible
title for oil and gas purposes to all its properties, interests in properties
and assets, real and personal, reflected in Parent's September 30, 2002
financial statements included in the Parent Reports, free and clear of any Lien,
except: (a) Liens reflected in the balance sheet of Parent as of September 30,
2002 included in the Parent Reports; (b) Liens for current taxes not yet due and
payable; and (c) such imperfections of title, easements and Liens that would not
have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. All leases and other agreements pursuant to
which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries leases or otherwise acquires or obtains
operating rights affecting any real or personal property are in good standing,
valid, and effective, except where the failure to be in good standing, valid or
effective would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect; and there is not, under any
such leases, any existing or prospective default or event of default or event
which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that would have or reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse



                                       30

Effect. All significant operating equipment of Parent and its Subsidiaries is in
good operating condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted. Parent has not
received any material advance, take-or-pay or other similar payments that
entitle purchasers of production to receive deliveries of hydrocarbons without
paying therefor, and, on a net, company-wide basis, Parent is neither
underproduced nor overproduced, in either case, to any material extent, under
gas balancing or similar arrangements.

         Section 4.16 INSURANCE. Parent and its Subsidiaries maintain insurance

respective businesses (taking into account the cost and availability of such
insurance).

         Section 4.17 NO BROKERS. Parent has not entered into any contract,
arrangement or understanding with any person or firm which may result in the
obligation of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub to pay any finder's fees,
brokerage or agent's commissions or other like payments in connection with the
negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except that Parent has retained Morgan Stanley to act as
its financial advisor in connection with the Merger and render the opinion
referred to in Section 4.18, the terms of which (including the fees owed by
Parent in connection therewith) have been disclosed in writing to the Company
prior to the date hereof.

         Section 4.18 OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR. The Board of Directors of
Parent has received the opinion of Morgan Stanley to the effect that the
Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to Parent; it being
understood and acknowledged by Parent that such opinion has been rendered for
the benefit of the Board of Directors of Parent, and is not intended to, and may
not, be relied upon by the Company, its affiliates or their respective
Subsidiaries.

         Section 4.19 CONTRACTS; DEBT INSTRUMENTS

         (a) Except for documents filed or listed as exhibits to the Parent
Reports filed since December 31, 2001, as of the date hereof, there are no
contracts that are material to the business, properties, assets, financial
condition or results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole ("Parent Material Contracts"). Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
is in violation of or in default under (nor does there exist any condition which
with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would cause such a
violation of or default under) any Parent Material Contract to which it is a
party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is bound, except for
violations or defaults that would not have or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each Parent
Material Contract is in full force and effect, and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent or one of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of Parent,
each of the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors' rights and general
principles of equity and except where the failure of any Parent Material
Contract to be a legal, valid and binding obligation and enforceable in
accordance with its terms would not have or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Adverse Effect. No condition exists



                                       31
<PAGE>

or event has occurred which (whether with or without notice or lapse of time or
both) would constitute a default by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries or, to the
knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under any Parent Material Contract
or result in a right of termination of any Parent Material Contract, except for
any condition or event that would not have or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Adverse Effect.

         (b) Set forth in Schedule 4.19(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter is,
as of the date hereof, (i) a list of all loan or credit agreements, notes,
bonds, mortgages, indentures and other agreements and instruments pursuant to
which any indebtedness of Parent or its Subsidiaries in an aggregate principal
amount in excess of $50,000,000 is outstanding or may be incurred, and (ii) the
respective principal amounts outstanding thereunder as of February 21, 2003.

         (c) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any
contract and there is no commitment, judgment, injunction, order or decree to
which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or subject to that has or
would reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or impairing the
conduct of business by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any contract that
may be terminable as a result of the Company's status as a competitor of any
party to such contract, except, in each case, for any prohibition, impairment or
termination right that would not have or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.20 VOTE REQUIRED. The affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy by holders of Parent Common
Stock and the outstanding Northstar Exchangeable Shares, voting as a single
class with the Parent Special Voting Stock (representing the Northstar
Exchangeable Shares as provided in Parent's certificate of incorporation),
represented in person or by proxy at a meeting at which a quorum is present,
approving the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock required to be issued

Parent capital stock necessary to approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (as applied to the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, the "Parent
Requisite Vote").

         Section 4.21 CERTAIN CONTRACTS. Neither the Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by (i) any non-competition agreement or any
other agreement or obligation which purports to limit the manner in which, or
the localities in which, the current business of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is
conducted or (ii) any executory agreement or obligation which pertains to the
acquisition or disposition of any asset, or which provides any third party any
lien, claim or preferential right with regard thereto, except, in the case of
this clause (ii), for such agreements or obligations that would not have or
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

Acquiring Person (as defined in the Parent Rights Agreement), the Distribution
Date (as defined in the Parent Rights Agreement) shall not be deemed to occur
and the Rights (as defined in the Parent Rights Agreement) will not separate

         or the expiration of any applicable waiting period required to

                  (xv) unless in the good faith opinion of its Board of
         Directors after consultation with its outside legal counsel complying
         with the following provisions would be inconsistent with the fiduciary

         and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, terminate, amend,
         modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality or standstill
         agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; and during
         such period shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under

         of its and its Subsidiaries' (taken as a whole) estimated production of
         proved reserves of these commodities during that period, (B) any period

                  (xix) shall not take any action to amend the Parent Rights

         third party from the other provisions of the Parent Rights Agreement,
         as applicable;

                  (xx) shall not split, combine, subdivide or reclassify its

                  (xxii) shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries
         to, (A) do business in any country in which Parent or any of its
         Subsidiaries is not doing business as of the date hereof or (B) enter
         into any joint venture, partnership or other joint business venture
         with any person in which the fair market value of Parent's or its
         Subsidiaries' aggregate investments and commitments exceed $50,000,000;
         and

                  (xxiii) shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries
         to, agree in writing or otherwise to take any of the foregoing actions.

         Section 5.2 NO SOLICITATION BY THE COMPANY.

         (a) The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries (i) will not (and
the Company will not permit its or its Subsidiaries' officers, directors,
employees, agents or representatives, including any investment banker, attorney
or accountant retained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to) solicit,
initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information)
any inquiry, proposal or offer (including any proposal or offer to its
stockholders) with respect to a third party tender offer, merger, consolidation,
business combination or similar transaction involving any assets or class of
capital stock of the Company, or any acquisition of 10% or more of the capital
stock of the Company (other than upon exercise of the Stock Options (as
hereinafter defined) that are outstanding as of the date hereof) or a business
or assets that



                                       39
<PAGE>

constitute 10% or more of the net revenues, net operating income or assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or a
series of related transactions, or any combination of the foregoing (any such
proposal, offer or transaction being hereinafter referred to as a "Company
Acquisition Proposal") or participate or engage in any discussions or
negotiations concerning a Company Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or
negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Company Acquisition Proposal; provided that, subject to Section 5.4(b), nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors
from (A) complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with
regard to a Company Acquisition Proposal, (B) making any disclosure to the
holders of Company Shares if in the good faith judgment of the Company's Board
of Directors failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law or the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange or (C) providing information (pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
in reasonably customary form and which does not contain terms that prevent the
Company from complying with its obligations under this Section 5.2) to or
engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any person or group who has
made an unsolicited bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal with respect to all
the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company if, with respect to the actions set forth in
clause (C), (x) in the good faith judgment of the Company's Board of Directors,
taking into account the likelihood of consummation and after consultation with
its financial advisors, such Company Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely
to result in a transaction more favorable to the holders of the Company Common
Shares from a financial point of view than the Merger (a "Company Superior
Proposal") and (y) the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable law.

         (b) The Company agrees that it will notify Parent promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) if any proposal or offer relating to or constituting a
Company Acquisition Proposal is received by, any information is requested from,
or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with,
the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or
representatives. In connection with such notice, the Company shall indicate the
identity of the person or group making such request or inquiry or engaging in
such negotiations or discussions and the material terms and conditions of any
Company Acquisition Proposal. Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent fully
informed on a prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours) of any material
changes, additions or adjustments to the terms of any such proposal or offer.
Prior to taking any action referred to in clause (C) of the proviso of Section
5.2(a), if the Company intends to participate in any such discussions or
negotiations or provide any such information to any such third party, the
Company shall give notice to Parent.

         (c) Nothing in this Section 5.2 shall permit the Company to enter into
any agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal during the term of
this Agreement, it being agreed that, during the term of this Agreement, the
Company shall not enter into any agreement with any person that provides for, or
in any way facilitates, a Company Acquisition Proposal, other than a
confidentiality agreement and/or standstill agreement permitted under Section
5.2(a) in reasonably customary form and which does not contain terms that
prevent the Company from complying with its obligations under this Section 5.2.

         Section 5.3 NO SOLICITATION BY PARENT.

         (a) Parent agrees that it and its Subsidiaries (i) will not (and Parent
will not permit its or its Subsidiaries' officers, directors, employees, agents
or representatives, including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, to) solicit, initiate or
encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiry,
proposal or offer (including any proposal or offer to its stockholders) with
respect to a third party tender offer, merger, consolidation, business
combination or similar transaction involving any assets or class of capital
stock of Parent, or any acquisition of 10% or more of the capital stock of
Parent (other than upon exercise of options to acquire Parent Common Stock under
the Parent Option Plans that are outstanding as of the date hereof) or a
business or assets that constitute 10% or more of the net revenues, net
operating income or assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in
a single transaction or a series of related transactions, or any combination of
the foregoing (any such proposal, offer or transaction being hereinafter
referred to as a "Parent Acquisition Proposal") or participate or engage in any
discussions or negotiations concerning a Parent Acquisition Proposal; and (ii)
will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or
negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Parent Acquisition Proposal; provided that, subject to Section 5.4(b), nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent Parent or its Board of Directors from
(A) complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to
a Parent Acquisition Proposal, (B) making any disclosure to the holders of
Parent Common Stock if in the good faith judgment of Parent's Board of Directors
failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable law or the rules of the AMEX or (C) providing information
(pursuant to a confidentiality agreement in reasonably customary form and which
does not contain terms that prevent Parent from complying with its obligations
under this Section 5.3) to or engaging in any negotiations or discussions with
any person or group who has made an unsolicited bona fide Parent Acquisition
Proposal with respect to all the outstanding shares of capital stock of Parent
or all or substantially all of the assets of Parent if, with respect to the
actions set forth in clause (C), (x) in the good faith judgment of Parent's
Board of Directors, taking into account the likelihood of consummation and after
consultation with its financial advisors, such Parent Acquisition Proposal is
reasonably likely to result in a transaction more favorable to the holders of
the Parent Common Stock from a financial point of view than the Merger (a
"Parent Superior Proposal") and (y) the Board of Directors of Parent, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under
applicable law.

         (b) Parent agrees that it will notify the Company promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) if any proposal or offer relating to or constituting a
Parent Acquisition Proposal is received by, any information is requested from,
or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with,
Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives.
In connection with such notice, Parent shall indicate the identity of the person
or group making such request or inquiry or engaging in such negotiations or
discussions and the material terms and conditions of any Parent Acquisition
Proposal. Thereafter, Parent shall keep the Company fully informed on a prompt
basis (and in any event within 24 hours) of any material changes, additions or
adjustments to the terms of any such proposal or offer. Prior to taking action
any referred to in clause (C) of the proviso of Section 5.3(a), if Parent
intends to



                                       41
<PAGE>

participate in any such discussions or negotiations or provide any such
information to any such third party, Parent shall give notice to the Company.

         (c) Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall permit Parent to enter into any
agreement with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal during the term of this
Agreement, it being agreed that, during the term of this Agreement, Parent shall
not enter into any agreement with any person that provides for, or in any way
facilitates, a Parent Acquisition Proposal, other than a confidentiality
agreement and/or standstill agreement permitted under Section 5.3(a) in
reasonably customary form and which does not contain terms that prevent Parent
from complying with its obligation under this Section 5.3.

         Section 5.4 MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS.

         (a) The Company will take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws to convene as
promptly as practicable a meeting of its stockholders for purposes of obtaining
the Company Requisite Vote in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent will take all action necessary
in accordance with applicable law and its certificate of incorporation and
bylaws to convene as promptly as practicable a meeting of its stockholders for
purposes of obtaining the Parent Requisite Vote in favor of the issuance of the
Parent Common Stock necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. Parent and the Company shall each use their reasonable best efforts to
hold their respective stockholders meetings on the same day.

         (b) Except as otherwise permitted by this Section 5.4, the Company and
Parent, through their respective Boards of Directors, shall (i) recommend
approval of the matters described in Section 5.4(a) to be submitted to their
respective stockholders, (ii) not withdraw, withhold, modify, or change such
recommendation in a manner adverse to the other party, (iii) not recommend or
declare advisable any Company Superior Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal, as
the case may be, and (iv) unless such recommendation has been withdrawn,
withheld, modified or changed as permitted by this Section 5.4(b), use their
reasonable best efforts to solicit the Company Requisite Vote (in the case of
the Company) and the Parent Requisite Vote (in the case of Parent). The Board of
Directors of the Company or Parent, as applicable (the "Withdrawing Party;" the
other party being the "Non-Withdrawing Party"), may at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Requisite Vote or Parent Requisite Vote, as applicable,
(1) withdraw, withhold, modify, or change, in a manner adverse to the
Non-Withdrawing Party, any approval or recommendation regarding this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby or (2) recommend and declare advisable
any Company Superior Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal, as the case may be
(the actions set forth in clauses (1) and (2) being referred to herein as
"Adverse Actions"), if its Board of Directors determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel that the failure to take the Adverse
Action in question would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under
applicable law. After the Board of Directors has made a determination to take an
Adverse Action pursuant to the previous sentence but at least two business days
prior to taking such Adverse Action, the Board of Directors of the Withdrawing
Party shall give the Non-Withdrawing Party written notice of the Withdrawing
Party's intention to take such Adverse Action (including a reasonable
description of the circumstances related thereto) so as to allow the
Non-Withdrawing Party to propose a modification to the terms of the Merger or
this Agreement



                                       42
<PAGE>

that would eliminate the need to take the Adverse Action. Notwithstanding any
Adverse Action taken by the Withdrawing Party, the Non-Withdrawing Party shall
have the option (the "Option"), exercisable in its sole discretion within two
business days of written notice of such Adverse Action by the Withdrawing Party
(which written notice shall be provided by the Withdrawing Party to the
Non-Withdrawing Party promptly, but in any event, within 24 hours, of the
Withdrawing Party taking such Adverse Action and shall include a reasonable
description of the circumstances related thereto), to cause the Withdrawing
Party to submit the matters to be voted on by such stockholders (as contemplated
hereby) to the stockholders of the Withdrawing Party at the relevant
stockholders meeting and, in connection with such submission, communicate the
circumstances under which the matters to be voted on by such stockholders (as
contemplated hereby) are being submitted to its stockholders. If the
Non-Withdrawing Party exercises the Option within the time permitted, the
Non-Withdrawing Party shall no longer be entitled to terminate this Agreement
under Section 7.3(b) or Section 7.4(b) below, as applicable. If the
Non-Withdrawing Party exercises the Option within the time permitted, the
Withdrawing Party shall use its reasonable best efforts, if so requested by the
Non-Withdrawing Party, to promptly furnish or cause to be furnished (in such
formats, including electronic formats, as the Non-Withdrawing Party or its
agents, advisors or attorneys may reasonably request) to the Non-Withdrawing
Party and its agents, advisors and attorneys, at the Non-Withdrawing Party's
expense, the most current, accurate and complete shareholders lists of the
Withdrawing Party, including non-objecting beneficial owner lists, as may be
requested by the Non-Withdrawing Party or its agents, advisors or attorneys from
time to time so that the Non-Withdrawing Party can solicit proxies from the
Withdrawing Party's stockholders. If the Non-Withdrawing Party fails to exercise
the Option within the time permitted, the Withdrawing Party may terminate this
Agreement at any time after the expiration of the relevant two business day
period but prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote (if the Withdrawing
Party is the Company) or the Parent Requisite Vote (if the Withdrawing Party is
Parent) pursuant to Section 7.3(c) or Section 7.4(c) below, as applicable;
provided, however, that in the event that the Non-Withdrawing Party proposes to
the Withdrawing Party any modifications to the terms of the Merger or this
Agreement during such two business day period (the "Modified Terms"), the
Withdrawing Party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.3(c) or Section 7.4(c) below, as applicable, unless and until the
Board of Directors of the Withdrawing Party (i) in good faith considers the
Modified Terms and (ii) makes a good faith determination, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that proceeding with a transaction with the
Non-Withdrawing Party reflecting the Modified Terms would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary obligations under applicable law. If the Non-Withdrawing Party
proposes Modified Terms to the Withdrawing Party pursuant to the previous
sentence which causes the Withdrawing Party's Board of Directors to reinstate
its recommendation regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and to proceed with a transaction with the Non-Withdrawing Party, then in
the event that subsequent to the acceptance by the Withdrawing Party of the
Modified Terms the Board of Directors of the Withdrawing Party again either (i)
withdraws, withholds, modifies, or changes, in a manner adverse to the
Non-Withdrawing Party, any approval or recommendation regarding this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) recommends and declares
advisable any Company Superior Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal, as the case
may be, then the Non-Withdrawing Party shall again have the right to exercise
the Option pursuant to the terms of this Section 5.4(b).

         case of Parent, obtaining the opinion described in Section 6.3(b)) as
         promptly as practicable and to cooperate with one another in (1)
         determining which filings are required to be made prior to the
         Effective Time with, and which consents, approvals, permits or
         authorizations are required to be obtained prior to the Effective Time
         from, governmental or regulatory authorities of the United States, the
         several states, and foreign jurisdictions in connection with the

         all such filings and timely seeking all such consents, approvals,
         permits or authorizations;

                  (iii) promptly notify each other of any communication
         concerning this Agreement or the Merger to that party from any
         governmental authority and permit the other party to review in advance
         any proposed communication concerning this Agreement or the Merger to
         any governmental entity;

                  (iv) not agree to participate in any meeting or discussion
         with any governmental authority in respect of any filings,
         investigation or other inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Merger
         unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
         permitted by such governmental authority, gives the other party the
         opportunity to attend and participate thereat;

                  (v) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence,
         filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance
         thereof) between them and their affiliates and their respective
         representatives on the one hand, and any government or regulatory
         authority or members or their respective staffs on the other hand, with
         respect to this Agreement and the Merger; and

                  (vi) furnish the other party with such necessary information
         and reasonable assistance as such other parties and their respective
         affiliates may reasonably request in connection with their preparation
         of necessary filings, registrations or submissions of information to
         any governmental or regulatory authorities, including any filings
         necessary or appropriate under the provisions of the HSR Act.

         (b) Without limiting Section 5.5(a), Parent and the Company shall:

                  (i) each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry
         of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment
         that would restrain, prevent or delay



                                       44
<PAGE>

         the Closing, including defending through litigation on the merits any
         claim asserted in any court by any party; and

                  (ii) each use reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate
         each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade
         regulation law that may be asserted by any governmental entity with
         respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
         reasonably possible (and in any event no later than 60 days following
         the termination of all applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act,
         unless the parties are in litigation with the government, in which case
         at the conclusion of such litigation).

         (c) Neither Parent nor the Company shall, without the other party's
prior written consent, commit to any divestitures, licenses, hold separate
arrangements or similar matters, including covenants affecting business
operating practices (or allow its Subsidiaries to commit to any divestitures,
licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar matters) in connection with the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement, but the parties shall commit or
consent to, and shall use reasonable efforts to effect (and shall cause their
Subsidiaries to commit or consent to and use reasonable efforts to effect), any
such divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar matters as
any governmental entity shall request if such divestitures, licenses, hold
separate arrangements or similar matters are required by any such governmental
entity as a condition to resolving such governmental entity's objections to the
Merger or obtaining its approval of the Merger and are contingent upon
consummation of the Merger; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 5.5(c) or the remainder of this Agreement, neither
Parent, the Company nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required
to agree (with respect to (x) Parent or its Subsidiaries or (y) the Company or
its Subsidiaries) to any divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or
similar matters, including covenants affecting business operating practices, if
such divestitures, licenses, arrangements or similar matters, individually or in
the aggregate, would have or reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.6 INSPECTION. From the date hereof to the Effective Time, the
Company and Parent shall allow all designated officers, attorneys, accountants
and other representatives of the other party access at all reasonable times upon
reasonable notice to the records and files, correspondence, audits and
properties, as well as to all information relating to commitments, contracts,
titles and financial position, or otherwise pertaining to the business and
affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries or Parent and its Subsidiaries,
including inspection of such properties; provided that no investigation pursuant
to this Section 5.6 shall affect any representation or warranty given by any
party hereunder, and provided further that notwithstanding the provision of
information or investigation by any party, no party shall be deemed to make any
representation or warranty except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall be required to provide any
information which it reasonably believes it may not provide to any other party
by reason of applicable law, rules or regulations, which that party reasonably
believes constitutes information protected by attorney/client privilege, or
which it is required to keep confidential by reason of contract or agreement
with third parties. The parties hereto will make reasonable and appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions
of the preceding sentence apply. The Company and Parent agree that they will
not, and will cause their representatives not to, use any information obtained
pursuant to this Section 5.6 for any purpose unrelated to the



                                       45
<PAGE>

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All nonpublic
information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall be governed by the
Confidentiality Agreement dated October 25, 2002 between Parent and the Company
(the "Confidentiality Agreement").

         Section 5.7 PUBLICITY. The Company and Parent will consult with each
other and will mutually agree upon any press releases or public announcements
pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall
not issue any such press releases or make any such public announcements prior to
such consultation and agreement, except as may be required by applicable law or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or make
such public announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult in
good faith with the other party before issuing any such press releases or making
any such public announcements.

         Section 5.8 REGISTRATION STATEMENT.

         (a) Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and as promptly as
practicable prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC as soon as practicable,
a Registration Statement on Form S-4 under the Securities Act (the "Registration
Statement"), with respect to the Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger. A
portion of the Registration Statement shall also serve as the joint proxy
statement with respect to the meetings of the stockholders of Parent and of the
Company in connection with the Merger (the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus"). The
respective parties will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the
Registration Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts, and the
Company will cooperate with Parent, to have the Registration Statement declared
effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain, prior to the effective date of the Registration
Statement, all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits or approvals
required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will
pay all expenses incident thereto. Parent will advise the Company, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement
has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance
of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/
Prospectus or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information.

         (b) Each of Parent and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its stockholders as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof.

         (c) Each of Parent and the Company agrees that the information provided
by it for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and each amendment or
supplement thereto, at the time of mailing thereof and at the time of the
respective meetings of stockholders of Parent and of the Company, or, in the
case of information provided by it for inclusion in the Registration Statement
or any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time it is filed or becomes
effective, will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to



                                       46
<PAGE>

be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

         Section 5.9 LISTING APPLICATION. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the AMEX prior to the Effective Time, subject to
official notice of issuance. Parent shall promptly prepare and submit to the
AMEX a supplemental listing application covering the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable in the Merger and shares issuable pursuant to Assumed Options (as
defined below).

         Section 5.10 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

         Section 5.11 AGREEMENTS OF AFFILIATES. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Parent a list identifying
all persons who, at the time of the meeting of the Company's stockholders
pursuant to Section 5.4, the Company believes may be deemed to be "affiliates"
of the Company, as that term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under
the Securities Act (the "Rule 145 Affiliates"). Parent shall be entitled to
place restrictive legends on any shares of Parent Common Stock received by such
Rule 145 Affiliates. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each person who is identified as a Rule 145 Affiliate in such list to deliver to
Parent, at or prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement, in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit D.

         Section 5.12 EXPENSES. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses, except as expressly provided in Section 7.5.

         Section 5.13 INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.

         (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law each person who is immediately prior to the
Effective Time, or has been at any time prior to the Effective Time, an officer
or director of the Company (or any Subsidiary or division thereof) and each
person who immediately prior to the effective time is serving or prior to the
Effective Time has served at the request of the Company as a director, officer,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (individually, an
"Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or
pertaining to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by them in their
capacities as such, whether commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the
Effective Time. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (an "Action"), (i) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay, as incurred, the fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified
Party, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent, in advance of the
final disposition of any such Action to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, and, if required, upon receipt of any undertaking required by
applicable law, and (ii) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation
to, cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided, however, neither
Parent nor the Surviving



                                       47
<PAGE>

Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without its written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and
provided further that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated pursuant to this Section 5.13(a) to pay the fees and disbursements of
more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any single Action, unless,
in the good faith judgment of any of the Indemnified Parties, there is or may be
a conflict of interests between two or more of such Indemnified Parties, in
which case there may be separate counsel for each similarly situated group.

         (b) The parties agree that the rights to indemnification hereunder,
including provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in defense of any
action or suit, in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and any
indemnification agreement of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters occurring through the Effective Time, shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective
Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses in respect of any Action pending or asserted or claim made within such
period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such
claim.

         (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain officers' and directors' liability insurance covering
the Indemnified Parties who are or at any time prior to the Effective Time were
covered by the Company's existing officers' and directors' liability insurance
("D&O Insurance") policies on terms substantially no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Parties than such existing insurance with respect to acts or
omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, prior to the Effective Time (whether
claims, actions or other proceedings relating thereto are commenced, asserted or
claimed before or after the Effective Time); provided that, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums in
excess of 250% of the 2003 annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date
hereof (the amount of which premiums are set forth in the Company Disclosure
Letter) (the "Maximum Premium"), but in such case shall purchase as much
coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. Parent shall have the right
to cause coverage to be extended under the Company's D&O Insurance by obtaining
a six-year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous than the
Company's existing D&O Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the
provisions of this Section 5.13(c).

         (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition
to any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under the
DGCL, or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.13 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the
Indemnified Parties.

         (e) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then and in either such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.13.

         Section 5.14 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

         (a) Parent hereby agrees to honor, and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries
to honor, all employee benefit plans, contracts, agreements and commitments of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries maintained or entered into by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof that apply to any current or
former employee or current or former director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the executive change-in-control severance agreements
between the Company and certain of its key employees (copies of which executive
change-in-control severance agreements have been furnished to Parent); provided,
however, that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 5.14,
Parent reserves the right to modify any such plan, contract, agreement or
commitment in accordance with its terms.

         (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.14(a):

                  (i) Parent and the Company agree that the consummation of the
         transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a "Change
         of Control" as that term is defined in the Ocean Energy, Inc. 2001
         Change of Control Severance Plan (the "Company Severance Plan"), and
         that, to the extent required by Section 4.5 of the Company Severance
         Plan, such plan shall not be modified with respect to severance
         benefits payable and Welfare Benefit Coverages provided as a result of
         Involuntary Terminations occurring before the one-year anniversary of
         the Effective Time. The Company agrees that, prior to the Effective
         Time, it shall amend the Company Severance Plan to provide that a
         transfer between Parent and one of its Subsidiaries or between two of
         its Subsidiaries at or after the Effective Time shall not constitute a
         termination of employment resulting in eligibility for severance;
         provided that if the transfer results in a Change in Duties, any such
         transfer may be treated as a basis for Involuntary Termination to the
         extent provided by the terms of the Company Severance Plan, including
         the definitions of "Involuntary Termination" and "Change in Duties"(as
         in effect on December 1, 2002).

                  (ii) Parent agrees that for the period beginning at the
         Effective Time and ending December 31, 2003 (or such later date
         determined by Parent), the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any
         successor entities to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) shall
         maintain the medical, health, life, and disability insurance plans, and
         the deferred compensation and retirement plans, as in effect
         immediately prior to the Effective Time, and prior to January 1, 2004
         shall not amend any such plan to reduce any benefit provided under any
         such plan. With respect to the Company's Retirement Savings Plan,
         Parent shall cause the Company to make an employer discretionary
         contribution for 2003 for the eligible participants at the same
         fraction of their eligible compensation as the Company's discretionary
         contributions made for 2001 and 2002.

                  (iii) If, during calendar year 2004, the benefits applicable
         to officers and employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries (and any
         successor entities to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) are
         materially modified then, for the remainder of calendar year 2004,
         Parent hereby agrees to, and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to,
         provide to officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
         (and any successor entities to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries)
         who become or remain regular (full-time)



                                       49
<PAGE>

         employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, without
         limitation, the Company and any successor entity to the Company for so
         long as it is a Subsidiary of Parent) employee benefits, no less
         favorable than those provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries to their
         similarly situated officers and employees.

                  (iv) Each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries (and any
         successor entities to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) who
         becomes a participant in any employee benefit plan, program, policy, or
         arrangement of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the
         Effective Time shall be given credit under such plan, program, policy,
         or arrangement for all service with the Company, any of its
         Subsidiaries, any of their predecessors to the extent such predecessor
         employment was recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
         and, if applicable, with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to
         becoming such a participant for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
         benefit determination; provided that this Section 5.14(b)(iv) shall not
         apply to the determination of accrual service under any defined benefit
         pension plan as defined in section 3(35) of ERISA (regardless of
         whether such plan is qualified under Code section 401(a)), and shall
         not apply to the determination of the right to receive, or the amount
         of, any retiree or other post-retirement medical service (except for
         COBRA medical continuation coverage as described in section 4980B of
         the Code).

                  (v) At such time, if any, as Parent causes an employee of the
         Company or its Subsidiaries (and any successor entities to the Company
         or any of its Subsidiaries) to be covered under a group health plan
         maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (other than the group
         health plan maintained by the Company at the Effective Time), Parent
         shall cause (A) such employee and his or her eligible dependents
         (including, without limitation, all such dependents of the employee
         covered immediately prior to such time under the Company's group health
         plan) to be credited under such Parent or Subsidiary group health plan,
         for the year during which such coverage under such group health plan
         begins, with any deductibles and copayments already incurred during
         such year under the group health plan of the Company (or successor
         entity to the Company), and (B) such Parent or Subsidiary group health
         plan to waive any preexisting condition restrictions to the extent
         necessary to provide immediate coverage (to the extent such preexisting
         condition restrictions have been waived, or would have been waived,
         under the Company's group health plan).

                  (vi) Nothing in this Section 5.14(b) shall be construed to
         restrict the ability of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including, without
         limitation, the Company and any successor entity to the Company for so
         long as it is a Subsidiary of Parent) to modify or terminate any plan
         (at or after the Effective Time) with respect to persons employed at
         operations outside the United States.

                  (vii) Nothing in this Section 5.14(b) shall be construed as a
         contract of employment, and this Section 5.14(b) shall not give any
         employee the right to be retained in the employ of Parent or any of its
         Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Section 5.14(b) shall be construed to
         require the provision of coverage or benefits to an employee following
         termination of employment except to the extent such coverage or
         benefits is otherwise required pursuant to the terms of the applicable
         plan or arrangement.



                                       50
<PAGE>

                  (viii) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.14 to the
         contrary, (1) the Average Monthly Compensation used to determine the
         benefit of each member under the Company's Executive Supplemental
         Retirement Plan ("ESRP") shall not be less than such members' Average
         Monthly Compensation as of January 1, 2003, (2) each member shall
         receive credit, for purposes of vesting in his Accrued Benefit, for his
         service with Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
         Subsidiaries) following the Effective Time, (3) no amendment may be
         made to the ESRP that would adversely affect the member's right to
         continued vesting under the ESRP based on his continued service with
         the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (4) if the ESRP is terminated,
         each member who is then an employee of the Parent and its Subsidiaries
         (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) automatically shall be
         100% vested on such termination.

                  (ix) The parties intend and agree that the employees of the
         Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date are third party
         beneficiaries with respect to the provisions of this Section 5.14 that
         are applicable to such employee and shall be entitled to enforce such
         provisions against the parties.

         (c) Parent and the Company shall take such actions, including (with
respect to the Company) the amendment of the options ("Stock Options") to
purchase Company Common Shares, and the plans pursuant to which such options
have been issued, to permit Parent to assume, and Parent shall assume, effective
at the Effective Time, each Option Plan and each Stock Option that remains
unexercised in whole or in part as of the Effective Time and substitute shares
of Parent Common Stock for the Company Common Shares purchasable under each such
assumed option ("Assumed Option"), which assumption and substitution shall be
effected as follows:

                  (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable
         under the Assumed Option shall be equal to 0.414 (to be adjusted
         appropriately if the Exchange Ratio is adjusted pursuant to Section
         2.4) times the number of Company Common Shares underlying the Assumed
         Option (or that would be purchasable if the option was then vested and
         exercisable and with any fractional amount rounded to the next lowest
         share);

                  (ii) the per share exercise price of such Assumed Option shall
         be an amount (with fractional amounts rounded to the next highest cent)
         equal to the per share exercise price of the Stock Option being assumed
         divided by 0.414 (to be adjusted appropriately if the Exchange Ratio is
         adjusted pursuant to Section 2.4);

                  (iii) Parent will provide each holder of each Stock Option
         being assumed with a statement showing the converted number of shares,
         the exercise price, and the expiration date for each Assumed Option;

                  (iv) for any individual whose service is terminated after the
         Effective Time and, in connection with such termination, such
         individual is eligible to receive severance benefits, such individual's
         non-qualified stock options that are exercisable on the date of such
         individual's termination shall continue to be exercisable during the
         one-year period following such termination; and



                                       51
<PAGE>

                  (v) any other provisions of each Assumed Option shall remain
         in effect; provided, however, that in the case of any option to which
         Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of the qualifications under
         Section 422 or 423 of the Code, the exercise price, the number of
         shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions
         of exercise of such option shall comply with Section 424(a) of the
         Code.

         (d) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for

exercise of the Assumed Options, and, as soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other
appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
the Assumed Options, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as any of the Assumed
Options remain outstanding.

         (e) Parent agrees that its Board of Directors (or the Compensation
Committee thereof) shall, at or prior to the Effective Time, adopt resolutions
specifically approving, for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, the

         Section 5.15 REORGANIZATION. From and after the date hereof and until
the Effective Time, none of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall knowingly (i) take any action, or fail to take any reasonable
action, as a result of which the Merger would fail to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code or (ii) enter
into any contract, agreement, commitment or arrangement to take or fail to take
any such action. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall not knowingly take
any action or knowingly cause any action to be taken which would cause the
Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section
368(a) of the Code (and any comparable provisions of applicable state or local
law).

         Section 5.16 DIVIDENDS. The Company shall coordinate with Parent
respecting the declaration, setting of record dates and payment dates of
dividends on the Company Common Shares so that holders of Company Common Shares

permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such

                                       55
<PAGE>

warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement such that the

right of termination if it exercises the Option or the circumstances giving rise
to the right to terminate under this Section 7.3(b) are no longer in effect
because the parties are proceeding on Modified Terms; or

         (c) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, (i) the Company is
the Withdrawing Party pursuant to Section 5.4(b), (ii) Parent had the right to
exercise the Option and (iii) Parent did not exercise the Option within the time
in which it had the right to do so (it being understood that the Company shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.3(c)
unless and until the Company shall have paid Parent any amounts due under
Section 7.5(a)).

         Section 7.4 TERMINATION BY PARENT. At any time prior to the Effective

         Section 7.5 EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

         (a) If this Agreement is terminated

                  (i) by the Company or Parent, after the public announcement of
         a Company Acquisition Proposal or after Parent has exercised the
         Option, pursuant to Section 7.2(b);

                  (ii) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.4(b); or

                  (iii) by the Company pursuant to Section 7.3(c);

then the Company shall pay Parent the Company Termination Amount (as defined
below) and, in addition, reimburse Parent for all expenses incurred by Parent in
connection with this Agreement up to the Reimbursement Maximum Amount (as
defined below) prior to or upon termination of this Agreement. All payments
under this Section 7.5(a) shall be made in cash by wire transfer to an account
designated by Parent at the time of such termination (or, in the case of a
termination pursuant to Section 7.3(c), prior to such termination). The term
"Company Termination Amount" shall mean $139,000,000; provided, however, that
if, upon the termination of this Agreement by the Company or Parent pursuant to
Section 7.2(b) after the public announcement of a Company Acquisition Proposal,
the Board of Directors of the Company shall not have (x) withdrawn, withheld,
modified or changed, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Board's approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger, (y) recommended a Company
Superior Proposal or (z) resolved to do any of the foregoing, then the "Company
Termination Amount" shall mean $69,500,000 plus, if (x) the Company executes and
delivers an agreement with respect to any Company Acquisition (as defined below)
or (y) a Company Acquisition is consummated, in any such case within 12 months
from the date of termination, an additional $69,500,000 (which additional amount
shall be paid promptly by wire transfer to an account designated by Parent). If
the Board of Directors of the Company recommends the acceptance by the
stockholders of the Company of a third-party tender or exchange offer for
Company Common Shares, such recommendation shall have the same consequences for
purposes of this paragraph as though an agreement with respect to a Company
Acquisition had been executed and delivered. For purposes hereof, "Company
Acquisition" means (i) a consolidation, exchange of shares or merger of the
Company with any person, other than Parent or one of its Subsidiaries or any of
the Company's Subsidiaries, and, in the case of a merger, in which the Company
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation, (ii) a merger of the
Company with a person, other than Parent or one of its Subsidiaries or any of
the Company's Subsidiaries, in which the Company shall be the continuing or
surviving corporation but the then outstanding Company Common Shares shall be
changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of the Company or any
other person or cash or any other property or the Company Common Shares
outstanding immediately before such merger shall after such merger represent
less than 50% of the voting stock of the Company outstanding immediately after
the merger, (iii) the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the
voting stock of the Company by any person (as such term is used under Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act), or (iv) a sale, lease or other transfer of 50% or
more of the assets, net revenues or net operating income of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person, other than Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries or any of the Company's Subsidiaries. The term "Reimbursement
Maximum Amount" shall mean $10,000,000. In addition, the Company shall reimburse
Parent for all expenses incurred by



                                       57
<PAGE>

Parent in connection with this Agreement up to the Reimbursement Maximum Amount
if this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 7.2(b) even if Parent
is not entitled to any Company Termination Amount under this Section 7.5(a). The
Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.5(a) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 7.5(a), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a
suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the payment set forth
in this Section 7.5(a), the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest
on the Company Termination Amount and other amounts to be reimbursed to Parent
under this Section 7.5(a) from the date payment was required to be made until
the date of such payment at the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made plus one percent (1%). If this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to a provision that calls for a payment to be
made under this Section 7.5(a), it shall not be a defense to the Company's
obligation to pay hereunder that this Agreement could have been terminated under
a different provision or could have been terminated at an earlier or later time.

                  (b) If this Agreement is terminated

                  (i) by the Company or Parent, after the public announcement of
         a Parent Acquisition Proposal or after the Company has exercised the
         Option, pursuant to Section 7.2(c);

                  (ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 7.3(b); or

                  (iii) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.4(c);

then Parent shall pay the Company the Parent Termination Amount (as defined
below) and, in addition, reimburse the Company for all expenses incurred by the
Company in connection with this Agreement up to the Reimbursement Maximum Amount
prior to or upon the termination of this Agreement. All payments under this
Section 7.5(b) shall be made in cash by wire transfer to an account designated
by the Company at the time of such termination (or, in the case of a termination
pursuant to Section 7.4(c), prior to such termination). The term "Parent
Termination Amount" shall mean $139,000,000; provided, however, that if, upon
termination of this Agreement by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section
7.2(c) after the public announcement of a Parent Acquisition Proposal, the Board
of Directors of Parent shall not have (x) withdrawn, withheld, modified or
changed, in a manner adverse to the Company, the Board's approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger, (y) recommended a Parent
Superior Proposal or (z) resolved to do any of the foregoing, then the "Parent
Termination Amount" shall mean $69,500,000 plus, if (x) Parent executes and
delivers an agreement with respect to any Parent Acquisition (as defined below)
or (y) a Parent Acquisition is consummated, in any such case, within 12 months
from the date of termination, an additional $69,500,000 (which additional amount
shall be paid promptly by wire transfer to an account designated by the
Company). If the Board of Directors of Parent recommends the acceptance by the
stockholders of Parent of a third-party tender or exchange offer for shares of
Parent Common Stock, such recommendation shall have the same consequences for
purposes of this paragraph as though an agreement with respect to a Parent
Acquisition had been executed and delivered. For purposes hereof, "Parent



                                       58
<PAGE>

Acquisition" means (i) a consolidation, exchange of shares or merger of Parent
with any person, other than the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or any of
Parent's Subsidiaries, and, in the case of a merger, in which Parent shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation, (ii) a merger of Parent with a
person, other than the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or any of Parent's
Subsidiaries, in which Parent shall be the continuing or surviving corporation
but the then outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall be changed into or
exchanged for stock or other securities of Parent or any other person or cash or
any other property or the shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding immediately
before such merger shall after such merger represent less than 50% of the voting
stock of Parent outstanding immediately after the merger, (iii) the acquisition
of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the voting stock of Parent by any
person (as such term is used under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), or (iv) a
sale, lease or other transfer of 50% or more of the assets, net revenues or net
operating income of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any
person, other than the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or any of Parent's
Subsidiaries. In addition, Parent shall reimburse the Company for all expenses
incurred by the Company in connection with this Agreement up to the
Reimbursement Maximum Amount if this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to
Section 7.2(c) even if the Company is not entitled to any Parent Termination
Amount under this Section 7.5(b). Parent acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 7.5(b) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Company
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent fails promptly to
pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.5(b), and, in order to obtain such
payment, the Company commences a suit which results in a judgment against Parent
for the payment set forth in this Section 7.5(b), Parent shall pay to the
Company its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the Parent Termination Amount and other
amounts to be reimbursed to the Company under this Section 7.5(b) from the date
payment was required to be made until the date of such payment at the prime rate
of JPMorgan Chase Bank in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made plus one percent (1%). If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to a
provision that calls for a payment to be made under this Section 7.5(b), it
shall not be a defense to Parent's obligation to pay hereunder that this
Agreement could have been terminated under a different provision or could have
been terminated at an earlier or later time.

         Section 7.6 EFFECT OF VOTE. Any right to terminate this Agreement
provided under Sections 7.1, 7.2(a), 7.2(d), 7.3(a) or 7.4(a) hereunder shall be
effective notwithstanding whether the Company Requisite Vote or the Parent
Requisite Vote has been obtained. Any right to terminate this Agreement provided
under Sections 7.2(b) or 7.4(b) hereunder shall be effective notwithstanding
whether the Parent Requisite Vote has been obtained. Any right to terminate this
Agreement provided under Sections 7.2(c) or 7.3(b) hereunder shall be effective
notwithstanding whether the Company Requisite Vote has been obtained.

         Section 8.1 SURVIVAL. (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement
and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to Article 7, all rights and
obligations of the parties hereto shall terminate, except the obligations of the
parties pursuant to Section 7.5 and Section 5.12 and except for the provisions
of Sections 8.3, 8.4, 8.6, 8.8, 8.9, 8.11, 8.12 and 8.13 and the

Confidentiality Agreement; provided that nothing herein shall relieve any party

its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement and, subject to Section

the case of such a breach, at law or in equity, shall be preserved. The parties
hereto agree that, if this Agreement has been terminated, any remedy or amount
payable pursuant to Section 7.5 or Section 5.12 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the party receiving payment thereunder unless the other party is in
material and willful breach of any of its covenants and agreements set forth in
this Agreement.

         (a) None of the representations, warranties and agreements in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the consummation of the Merger; provided, however, that Article 2, this
Article 8 and the agreements contained in Sections 5.11-5.14 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger, unless otherwise provided herein.

                  outstanding) in such number;

         (ii)     The dividend rate or method of determining dividends on the
                  shares of that series, any conditions upon which such
                  dividends shall be payable, and the date or dates or the
                  method for determining the date or dates upon which such
                  dividends shall be payable, whether such dividends, if any,
                  shall be cumulative, and, if so, the date or dates from which
                  dividends payable on such shares shall accumulate, and the
                  relative rights of priority, if any, of payment of dividends
                  on shares of that series;

         (iii)    The voting rights and powers, if any, of the holders of any
                  series of Preferred Stock generally or with respect to any

                  than one vote per share, and which may, without limiting the
                  generality of any other series of Preferred Stock or all
                  series of Preferred Stock as a class, to elect one or more
                  directors of the Corporation generally or under such specific
                  circumstances and on such conditions, as shall be provided in
                  the resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors (or
                  such committee of the Board of Directors, as the case may be)
                  adopted pursuant hereto, including, without limitation, in the
                  event there shall have been a default in the payment of
                  dividends on or redemption of any one or more series of
                  Preferred Stock;

         (iv)     Whether that series shall have conversion or exchange
                  privileges with respect to shares of any other class or
                  classes of stock or of any other series of any class of stock,
                  and, if so, the terms and conditions of such conversion or
                  exchange, including provision for adjustment of the conversion
                  or exchange rate upon occurrence of such events as the Board
                  of Directors shall determine;

         (v)      Whether the shares of that series shall be redeemable, and, if
                  so, the price or prices and the terms and conditions of such
                  redemption, including their relative rights of priority, if
                  any, of redemption, the date or dates upon or after which they
                  shall be redeemable, provisions regarding redemption notices,
                  and the amount per share payable in case of redemption, which
                  amount may vary under different conditions and at different
                  redemption dates;

         (vi)     Whether that series shall have a sinking fund for the
                  redemption or repurchase of shares of that series, and, if so,
                  the terms, conditions and amount of such sinking fund;

         (vii)    The rights, if any, of the shares of that series in the event
                  of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or
                  winding up of the Corporation or in the event of any merger or
                  consolidation of or sale of assets by the Corporation, and the
                  relative rights of priority, if any, of payment of shares of
                  that series;


                                       2
<PAGE>

         (viii)   The conditions or restrictions upon the creation of
                  indebtedness of the Corporation or upon the issuance of
                  additional Preferred Stock or other capital stock ranking on a
                  parity therewith, or prior thereto, with respect to dividends
                  or distribution of assets upon liquidation;

         (ix)     The conditions or restrictions with respect to the issuance
                  of, payment of dividends upon, or the making of other
                  distributions to, or the acquisition or redemption of, shares
                  ranking junior to the Preferred Stock or to any series thereof
                  with respect to dividends or distribution of assets upon
                  liquidation; and

         (x)      Any other designations, powers, preferences, and relative,
                  participating, optional or other rights, including, without
                  limitation, any qualifications, limitations, or restrictions
                  thereof.

         Subject to the provisions of this Article IV, shares of one or more
series of Preferred Stock may be authorized or issued from time to time as shall
be determined by and for such consideration as shall be fixed by the Board of
Directors (or a designated committee thereof), in an aggregate amount not
exceeding the total number of shares of Preferred Stock authorized by this
Certificate of Incorporation. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock
may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, without a vote of the holders of the
Preferred Stock, or of any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holder is
required pursuant to any Preferred Stock Series Resolution. Except as required
by law, holders of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to receive notice of
any meeting of stockholders at which they are not entitled to vote. Except in
respect of series particulars fixed by the Board of Directors as permitted
hereby, all shares of Preferred Stock shall be of equal rank and shall be
identical. All shares of any one series of Preferred Stock so designated by the
Board of Directors shall be alike in every particular, except that shares of any
one series issued at different times may differ as to the dates from which
dividends thereon shall be cumulative.

         B.       Common Stock

                  Resolution, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion, out
                  of funds legally available for the payment of dividends and at
                  such times and in such manner as determined by the Board of
                  Directors, declare and pay dividends on the Common Stock of
                  the Corporation.

         (ii)     In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
                  the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, after
                  payment or provision for payment of the debts and other
                  liabilities of the Corporation and payment or setting aside
                  for payment of any preferential amount due to the holders of
                  any other class or series of stock, the holders of the Common
                  Stock shall be entitled to receive ratably any or all assets
                  remaining to be paid or distributed.

         (iii)    Subject to any special voting rights set forth in any
                  Preferred Stock Series Resolution, the holders of the Common
                  Stock of the Corporation shall be entitled at all meetings of
                  stockholders to one vote for each share of such stock held by


                                       3
<PAGE>

                  them. Except as may be provided in a Preferred Stock Series
                  Resolution, the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right to
                  vote for the election of directors and for all other purposes.

         C.       No Preemptive Rights

         No holder of shares of stock of the Corporation shall have any
preemptive or other rights, except as such rights are expressly provided by
contract, to purchase or subscribe for or receive any shares of any class, or
series thereof, of stock of the Corporation, whether now or hereafter
authorized, or any warrants, options, bonds, debentures or other securities
convertible into, exchangeable for or carrying any right to purchase any shares
of any class, or series thereof, of stock; but such additional shares of stock
and such warrants, options, bonds, debentures or other securities convertible
into, exchangeable for or carrying any right to purchase any shares of any
class, or series thereof, of stock may be issued or disposed of by the Board of
Directors to such persons, and on such terms and for such lawful consideration,
as in its discretion it shall deem advisable or as to which the Corporation
shall have by binding contract agreed.

         D.       Registered Owner

         The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the person in whose name any
share of its stock is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes and shall
not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest in, such
share on the part of any other person, whether or not the Corporation shall have
notice thereof, except as expressly provided by applicable law.

                                   ARTICLE V
                               BOARD OF DIRECTORS

         The following provisions are inserted for the management of the
business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for further
definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of
its directors and stockholders:

         The number and terms of the Board of Directors of the Corporation and
the procedures to elect directors, to remove directors, and to fill vacancies in
the Board of Directors shall be as follows:

         (i) Subject to the rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock
         to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the number
         of directors that shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall
         from time to time be fixed exclusively by the Board of Directors by a
         resolution adopted by a majority of the whole Board of Directors
         serving at the time of that vote. No decrease in the number of
         directors shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent
         director. Directors of the Corporation need not be elected by written
         ballot unless the Bylaws of the Corporation otherwise provide.

         (ii) Vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from death,
         resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office, or
         other cause and newly-created directorships resulting from any increase
         in the authorized number of directors may only be filled by no less
         than a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office, though
         less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director (but not by the
         stockholders except as required


                                       4

         by law), and each director shall hold office until the first meeting of
         stockholders held after his election for the purpose of electing
         directors and until his successor is elected and qualified or until his
         earlier death, resignation, or removal from office.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more
series of Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting
separately by series, to elect one or more directors at an annual or special
meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and
other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of such
series of Preferred Stock.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         The Corporation shall indemnify, in accordance with and to the full
extent now or hereafter permitted by law, any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(including, without limitation, an action by or in the right of the
Corporation), by reason of his acting as a director or officer of the
Corporation (and the Corporation, in the discretion of the Board of Directors,
may so indemnify a person by reason of the fact that he is or was an employee or
agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation
in any other capacity for or on behalf of the Corporation) against any liability
or expense actually and reasonably incurred by such person in respect thereof;
provided, however, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify an officer or
director in connection with an action, suit or proceeding initiated by such
person only if such action, suit or proceeding was authorized by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation. Such indemnification is not exclusive of any other
right to indemnification provided by law or otherwise. The right to
indemnification conferred by this Article VI shall be deemed to be a contract
between the Corporation and each person referred to herein.

                                  ARTICLE VII
                         LIMITED LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS

         No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty by such director
as a director, except for liability (a) for any breach of the director's duty of
loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (b) for acts or omissions not in
good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of
law, (c) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, or (d) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper
personal benefit. Any amendment or repeal of this Article VII shall be
prospective only, and neither the amendment, modification nor repeal of this
Article VII shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article VII in respect
of any matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for
this Article VII would accrue or arise, prior to such amendment, modification or
repeal. If the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware hereafter is
amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the
liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation, in
addition to the limitation on personal liability provided herein, shall be
eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware, as so amended from time to time.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                              POWER TO AMEND BYLAWS

         In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by
statute, the Bylaws of the Corporation may be altered, amended or repealed and
new Bylaws may be adopted by (i) the Board of Directors in accordance with the
Bylaws or (ii) the stockholders of the Corporation by an affirmative vote of the
holders of at least a majority of the votes of the outstanding shares of the
class or classes or series of stock then entitled to be voted thereon, voting
together as a single class.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                    AMENDMENT OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

         Subject to the provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation and
applicable law, the Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to
time to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this
Certificate of Incorporation, and any other provisions authorized by the laws of
the State of Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted, in the
manner now or hereafter prescribed by law; and, all rights, preferences and
privileges of whatsoever nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any
other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation in
its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right
reserved in this Article IX.

                               THIRD AMENDMENT TO
                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


         WHEREAS, Ocean Energy, Inc. ("OEI") and James T. Hackett ("Executive")
have heretofore entered into an Employment Agreement (the "Agreement"),
initially effective as of September 16, 1998; and

         WHEREAS, the Agreement has been subsequently amended on two occasions
and OEI, Devon Energy Corporation ("Devon") and Executive desire to further
amend the Agreement in certain respects, contingent on, and effective upon, the
consummation of the transactions (the "Merger") contemplated by the Agreement
and Plan of Merger by and among Devon, Devon Newco Corporation, and OEI dated as
of February 23, 2003, as the same may be amended from time to time (the "Merger
Agreement");

         NOW, THEREFORE, the Agreement is amended as follows, effective as of
the "Effective Time" (which, for purposes of this Amendment, shall have the
meaning ascribed to it in the Merger Agreement):

         1.       References to the "Company" in the Agreement shall mean Devon
         Energy Corporation.

         2.       Paragraph 1.2 of the Agreement shall be amended to read as
         follows:

                  "1.2 POSITIONS. Effective as of the Effective Time, the
         Company shall cause Executive to be appointed the President and Chief
         Operating Officer of the Company. The Company shall maintain Executive
         in such positions, or such other positions as the parties mutually may
         agree, for the full term of Executive's employment hereunder. The term
         "Effective Time" shall have the meaning ascribed to it in the Agreement
         and Plan of Merger by and among Devon Energy Corporation, Devon Newco
         Corporation, and Ocean Energy, Inc. dated as of February 23, 2003, as
         the same may be amended from time to time (the "Merger Agreement")."

         3.       Article I is amended by adding thereto a new Paragraph 1.6,
         Office Location, to read as follows:

                  "1.6 OFFICE LOCATION. The Company's principal executive
                  offices shall be maintained in the greater Oklahoma City,
                  Oklahoma area. It is anticipated that Executive will regard
                  Oklahoma City as the primary location of his office. Prior to
                  the relocation of his residence to Oklahoma City, the Company
                  shall provide Executive with appropriate airplane
                  transportation between Oklahoma City and Houston, Texas, or
                  promptly reimburse



<PAGE>

                  Executive for the cost thereof. In addition, prior to
                  Executive's relocation to the greater Oklahoma City area (as
                  provided below), the Company shall provide Executive with, or
                  promptly reimburse Executive for the cost of, a temporary
                  rented, furnished apartment or condominium in the greater
                  Oklahoma City area and the use of an automobile while there
                  (the "Temporary Benefits"). All utility expenses, gasoline,
                  parking and other expenses incurred by Executive and
                  reasonably related to the Temporary Benefits shall be paid by
                  the Company. The Temporary Benefits provided Executive shall
                  be of a nature and have a status appropriate for Executive's
                  position with the Company. To the extent that the Company's
                  provision or payment of any of these items is taxable
                  compensation to Executive, the Company shall pay Executive, at
                  such applicable times, an additional amount in cash such that
                  the benefits are provided to Executive without any "tax cost,"
                  whether federal, state or otherwise, to him.

                           By May 1, 2004, Executive shall notify the Company
                  whether he is relocating to the greater Oklahoma City area or
                  exercising his right to terminate pursuant to paragraph
                  2.3(i). If Executive notifies the Company that he is
                  relocating, he shall use his reasonable best efforts to so
                  relocate by May 31, 2004, and if Executive has not relocated
                  to the greater Oklahoma City area by June 30, 2004, the
                  Company may terminate Executive's employment and such
                  termination shall be deemed to have been for cause pursuant to
                  paragraph 2.2(iii)."

         4.       Paragraph 2.1 is amended by adding a new sentence thereto to
         read as follows:

                  "Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term of this Agreement
                  shall not expire prior to the fifth anniversary of the
                  Effective Time, unless sooner terminated pursuant to the other
                  provisions hereof."

         5.       Item (D) of Paragraph 2.3(i) is amended to read as follows:

                  "(D) the Company's principal executive offices cease to be in
                  the greater Oklahoma City area or Executive is required to
                  work at an office other than the principal executive offices
                  of the Company, excluding business travel reasonably
                  consistent with Executive's past practice;"

         6.       Paragraph 2.3 is further amended by adding thereto a new
         sentence to read as follows:

                  "The Company and Executive agree that Executive may not
                  terminate his employment pursuant to paragraph 2.3(i) due to a
                  change in his duties, responsibilities, positions or principal
                  place of employment based on the same as they existed
                  immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however,
                  the foregoing shall not prevent Executive from terminating
                  pursuant to paragraph 2.3(i)


                                      -2-
<PAGE>
                  based on any change from those duties, responsibilities,
                  positions or principle place of employment as in effect
                  immediately following the Effective Time; and provided,
                  further, that upon not less than four weeks notice, Executive
                  may in all events terminate his employment on May 1, 2004 and
                  such termination shall be deemed to be for a reason
                  encompassed by paragraph 2.3(i) for which there is no
                  correction by the Company and upon such termination the
                  Company shall provide Executive with the Termination
                  Benefits."

         7.       Paragraph 3.9(v) is amended by adding thereto the following:

                           "Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in the
                  ESRP or Executive's Membership Agreement thereunder to the
                  contrary, Executive may elect, at any time prior to the
                  commencement of his benefit under the ESRP in an annuity form,
                  to receive an amount equal to 95% of the Actuarial Equivalent
                  (as such term is defined in the ESRP) of his then vested
                  Accrued Benefit under the ESRP in a single lump sum. Upon such
                  election, the non-vested portion, if any, of Executive's
                  Accrued Benefit shall be forfeited. The Company shall cause
                  the ESRP and Executive's Membership Agreement thereunder to be
                  amended as necessary to reflect this Paragraph 3.9(v)."

         8.       Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company
         continues to have the right to terminate Executive's employment at any
         time pursuant to paragraph 2.2 and any such termination by the Company,
         other than pursuant to paragraph 2.2(iii) or (iv), shall entitle
         Executive to the Termination Benefits.

         9.       As amended hereby, the Agreement is specifically ratified and
         reaffirmed. If the Merger Agreement is terminated without the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, this Amendment
         shall be null and void and of no effect.

                               SEVERANCE AGREEMENT


         WHEREAS, Ocean Energy, Inc. ("OEI") and James T. Hackett ("Executive")
have heretofore entered into a Severance Agreement (the "Agreement"), initially
effective as of August 25, 1998; and

         WHEREAS, the Agreement has been subsequently amended, and OEI, Devon
Energy Corporation ("Devon") and Executive desire to further amend the Agreement
in certain respects, contingent on, and effective upon, the consummation of the
transactions (the "Merger") contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger by
and among Devon, Devon Newco Corporation, and OEI dated as of February 23, 2003,
as the same may be amended from time to time (the "Merger Agreement");

         NOW, THEREFORE, the Agreement is amended as follows, effective as of
the "Effective Time" (which, for purposes of this Amendment, shall have the
meaning ascribed to it in the Merger Agreement):

         1.       References to the "Company" in the Agreement shall mean Devon
         Energy Corporation.

         2.       Clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) of Section 1(a) of the Agreement
         shall be amended to read as follows:

                  "(i) Executive is assigned any duties as the President and
                  Chief Operating Officer of the Company that are significantly
                  less than or below the duties generally associated with such
                  positions in a comparable company;"

                  (ii) the sum of Executive's annual base salary and bonus for
                  2003 or 2004 is less than the average of the total base salary
                  and bonus paid to Executive in 2001 and 2002;

                                     . . . .

                  (iv) Executive's principal place of employment is changed to a
                  location other than the principal executive offices of the
                  Company or such Company offices are changed to a location
                  other than the greater Oklahoma City area."

         3.       The Company agrees that the Merger constitutes a Change of
         Control for purposes of this Agreement, as hereby amended, and the
         two-year termination "protected" period provided in Section 3 with
         respect to such Change of Control shall begin on the Effective Time.

                       FORM OF COMPANY AFFILIATE'S LETTER

         This SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT, dated as of _________, 2003 (this
"Agreement") is among Devon Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), and the undersigned shareholder ("Shareholder") of Ocean Energy,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Capitalized terms not otherwise
defined in this Agreement have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger
Agreement.

                                    RECITALS

         A. Parent, Devon NewCo Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and the Company have entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 23, 2003 (the "Merger
Agreement"), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge (the "Merger") with and
into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger.

         B. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, outstanding
Company Common Shares will be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock;

         C. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder is a
material inducement to Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement; and

         D. Shareholder has been advised that Shareholder may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of the Company, as such term is used (i) for purposes of paragraphs
(c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act").

         NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as
follows:

         1.       Acknowledgments by Shareholder. Shareholder acknowledges and
understands that the representations, warranties and covenants made by
Shareholder set forth in this Agreement will be relied upon by Parent, the
Company, and their respective affiliates and counsel, and that substantial
losses and damages may be incurred by such persons if Shareholder's
representations, warranties or covenants are breached. Shareholder has carefully
read this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and has consulted with such legal
counsel and financial advisers as Shareholder has deemed appropriate in
connection with the execution of this Agreement.

         2.       Compliance with Rule 145 and the Act.

         (a)      Shareholder has been advised that (i) the issuance of shares
of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger is expected to be effected
pursuant to a Registration Statement filed by Parent on Form S-4, and the resale
of such shares will be subject to the restrictions set forth in Rule 145 under
the Act unless such shares are otherwise transferred

                                  Exhibit D-1


<PAGE>

pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or an appropriate
exemption from registration, and (ii) Shareholder may be deemed to be an
affiliate of the Company. Shareholder accordingly agrees not to sell, pledge,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of Parent Common Stock issued to
Shareholder in the Merger, unless (i) such sale, pledge, transfer or other
disposition is made in conformity with the requirements of Rule 145 under the
Act, (ii) such sale, pledge, transfer or other disposition is made pursuant to
an effective registration statement under the Act, or (iii) Shareholder delivers
to Parent a written opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent to the effect that such sale, pledge, transfer or other
disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.

         (b)      Parent will give stop transfer instructions to its transfer
agent with respect to any Parent Common Stock received by Shareholder pursuant
to the Merger and there will be placed on the certificates representing such
Parent Common Stock, or any substitutions therefor, legends stating in
substance:

         "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED PURSUANT TO A
         TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
         1933 APPLIES, AND MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED IN CONFORMITY WITH RULE 145,
         PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT, OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH
         A WRITTEN OPINION OF COUNSEL, REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE ISSUER, IN
         FORM AND SUBSTANCE TO THE EFFECT THAT SUCH TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM
         REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."

The legend set forth above shall be removed (by delivery of a substitute
certificate without such legend), and Parent shall so instruct its transfer
agent, if a registration statement respecting the sale of the shares has been
declared effective under the Act or if Shareholder delivers to Parent (i)
satisfactory written evidence that the shares have been sold in compliance with
Rule 145 (in which case, the substitute certificate will be issued in the name
of the transferee), or (ii) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent to the effect that sale of the shares by the
holder thereof is no longer subject to Rule 145.

         3.       Miscellaneous.

         (a)      This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same document. Delivery of an executed counterpart of
this Agreement by facsimile shall be effective to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law.

         (b)      This Agreement shall be enforceable by, and shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns. As used in this Agreement, the term "successors and assigns" means,
where the context to permits, heirs, executors, administrators, trustees and
successor trustees, and personal and other representatives.

         (c)      This Agreement shall be deemed to be made in and in all
respects shall be interpreted, construed and governed by and in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware.


                                  Exhibit D-2
<PAGE>

The parties irrevocably and unconditionally consent to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and of the United States of
America, in either case located in Wilmington, Delaware (the "Delaware Courts")
for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and agree not to commence any
litigation relating thereto except in such Delaware Courts), waive any objection
to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Delaware Courts and agree
not to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such litigation brought therein
has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

         (d)      If any term, provision, covenant, or restriction contained in
this Agreement is held by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants, and restrictions contained in this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected,
impaired, or invalidated.

         (e)      Counsel to the parties to the Merger Agreement shall be
entitled to rely upon this Agreement as needed.

         (f)      This Agreement shall not be modified or amended, or any right
waived or any obligations excused, except by a written agreement signed by both
parties.

         (g)      Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, this Agreement and all obligations under this Agreement shall
terminate upon the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its
terms.

         (h)      From and after the Effective Time of the Merger and as long
as is necessary in order to permit Shareholder to sell Parent Common Stock held
by Shareholder pursuant to Rule 145 and, to the extent applicable, Rule 144
under the Act, Parent will file on a timely basis all reports required to be
filed by it pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the
rules and regulations thereunder, as the same shall be in effect at the time,
and shall otherwise make available adequate public information regarding Parent
in such manner as may be required to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)
of Rule 144 under the Act.

                            [SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS]
