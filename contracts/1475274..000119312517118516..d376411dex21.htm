WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Purchaser, Parent and the
Company, have approved this Agreement and the acquisition of the Company by

Agreement;

WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement, Purchaser has agreed to commence a
tender offer (as may be amended, supplemented or modified, the " __ _Offer_
__") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (such
shares of Company Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as the " __
_Shares_ __"), at a price per Share of $11.60 (such amount or any greater
amount per Share that may be paid pursuant to the Offer, and as may be
adjusted in accordance with this Agreement, the " __ _Offer Price_ __");

WHEREAS, as soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time, Purchaser will
be merged with and into the Company, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, with the Company continuing as the
Surviving Corporation (the " __ _Merger_ __"), with the Merger to be effected
pursuant to Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " __ _DGCL_ __"), whereby each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be canceled in
accordance with _Sections 2.5(i)_ and _2.5(ii)_ and other than Dissenting
Shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, payable
to the holder in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes
as contemplated by this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " __ _Company Board_ __")
has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, are

Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; (iii)
resolved that the Merger shall be effected as soon as practicable following
the Acceptance Time without a vote of the Companys stockholders pursuant to
Section 251(h) of the DGCL; and (iv) subject to the terms hereof, resolved to
recommend that the Companys stockholders accept the Offer and tender their

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Purchaser and Parent have
unanimously approved and declared advisable this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows: ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER

 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, as promptly as practicable after the Agreement
Date, and in any event on or before April 24, 2017 (the date of such
commencement, the " __ _Offer Commencement Date_ __"), Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all of the Shares at a price per
share equal to the Offer Price.

 

(b) The obligation of Purchaser to, and of Parent to cause Purchaser to,
accept for payment and pay for any Shares validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction, or
waiver by Purchaser or Parent, of (x) the condition (the " __ _Minimum
Condition_ __") that at least that number of shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date of the
Offer (other than shares of Company Common Stock tendered by guaranteed
delivery that have not yet been "received," as such term is defined in
Section 251(h) of the DGCL, by the depositary for the Offer), when added to
any shares of Company Common Stock already owned by Purchaser, if any, equals
a majority of the then issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
and (y) the other conditions set forth in _Annex A_ (the conditions
described in clauses (x) and (y) are collectively referred to as the " __
_Offer Conditions_ __"). Subject to the satisfaction, or waiver by Purchaser
or Parent, of the Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for
payment (the time of such acceptance for payment, the " __ _Acceptance Time_
__") and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
three Business Days) after the Expiration Date and in any event in compliance
with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The Offer Price payable in respect
of each Share validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
shall be paid to the seller of such Share in cash, without interest, subject
to the deduction or withholding of any Taxes as contemplated in _Section_ __ _
2.9_, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.
The time scheduled for payment for shares of Company Common Stock accepted
for payment pursuant to and subject to the conditions of the Offer is referred
to in this Agreement as the " __ _Offer Closing_ __", and the date on which
the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " __ _Offer
Closing Date_ __."

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase that describes
the terms and conditions of the Offer as set forth in this Agreement.
Purchaser and Parent expressly reserve the right to waive (in whole or in
part) any Offer Condition at any time and from time to time, to increase the
Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the
Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that without the prior written consent of the
Company, Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the
form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the number of Shares
to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend or modify any of the Offer Conditions
in a manner that is adverse to the holders of Shares or impose conditions to
the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (v) amend, modify or waive

 



2  the Minimum Condition, or (vi) extend or otherwise change any time period
for the performance of any obligation of Purchaser or Parent (including the
Expiration Date) in a manner other than pursuant to and in accordance with
this Agreement.

(d) Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall initially
be scheduled to expire at midnight, New York City time, at the end of the day
on the date that is twenty Business Days (calculated as set forth in Rule
14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) after the Offer
Commencement Date (the " __ _Initial Expiration Date_ __"). Notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, unless
this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _
7.1_, (i) if, at midnight, New York City time, at the end of the day on the
Initial Expiration Date or any subsequent date and time as of which the Offer
is scheduled to expire, any Offer Condition is not satisfied or, to the extent
waivable in accordance with the terms hereof, has not been waived by Purchaser
or Parent, Purchaser shall (subject to the rights or remedies of the parties
hereto hereunder, including under _Article_ __ _ VII_), extend (and re-
extend) the Offer and its expiration date beyond the Initial Expiration Date
(the Initial Expiration Date as it may be extended herein is referred to as
the " __ _Expiration Date_ __") for one or more periods, in consecutive
increments of up to ten Business Days each, the length of each such period to
be determined by Parent in its sole discretion (or such longer period as
Parent and the Company may mutually agree) to permit such Offer Condition to
be satisfied (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Offer
shall not be extended pursuant to this clause (i) if all Offer Conditions
have been satisfied or waived) and (ii) if, at or prior to midnight, New York
City time, at the end of any Expiration Date, Parent delivers a notice (a " __
_Financing_ ___Extension Notice_ __") to the Company representing that the
full amount of the Debt Financing has not been funded and would not be
available to be funded at the Offer Closing and the Merger Closing if the
Expiration Date were not extended, Purchaser may extend (and re-extend) the
Offer for one or more periods, in consecutive increments of up to ten Business
Days each, the length of each such period to be determined by Parent in its
sole discretion (or such longer period as Parent and the Company may mutually
agree) to permit the funding of the Debt Financing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall Purchaser (x) be required to extend the Expiration Date
to any date beyond the Outside Date or (y) without the prior written consent
of the Company be permitted to extend the Expiration Date to any date beyond
the Outside Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser
shall, with or without the written consent of the Company, extend the Offer
for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of
the SEC or its staff, any rule or regulation of NASDAQ or any other applicable
Law, in each case, applicable to the Offer.

(e) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except in connection
with a termination of this Agreement permitted in accordance with the terms of
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_. In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, whether or not the Expiration Date has occurred,
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and in any
event within twenty-four hours of such termination), irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer, not acquire any Shares pursuant thereto,
and cause any depositary acting on its behalf to promptly return in accordance
with applicable Law all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

 



3 (f) On the Offer Commencement Date, Purchaser and Parent shall (i) file or
cause to be filed with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 under the
Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
__ _Schedule TO_ __") that will contain or incorporate by reference the
related offer to purchase the Shares pursuant to the Offer, the form of the
related letter of transmittal, the summary advertisement and other ancillary
Offer documents pursuant to which the Offer will be made and instruments
pursuant to which the Offer will be made (collectively, and together with all
exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto, the " __ _Offer Documents_
__"); and (ii) cause the Schedule TO and related Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of Shares in accordance with applicable federal
securities Laws. The Company shall promptly furnish to Purchaser and Parent
in writing all information concerning the Company and its stockholders that
may be required by applicable Law to be set forth in the Offer Documents or
reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by this 
_Section_ __ _ 1.1(f)_. The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC, and Purchaser and Parent shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel. Each
of Purchaser, Parent and the Company agrees to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. Purchaser and Parent
further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so
corrected (if applicable) to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities Laws. Upon receipt of any written or oral comments by
Purchaser, Parent or their counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Offer Documents, or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments
or supplements to the Offer Documents, Purchaser and Parent agree to (i)
promptly provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any such
written comments or requests (or a description of any such oral comments or
requests); (ii) provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity
to comment on any proposed response thereto, and to give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any such comments made by the Company and its counsel;
(iii) provide the Company and its counsel an opportunity to participate with
Purchaser, Parent or their counsel in any materials discussions or meetings
with the SEC or its staff; and (iv) provide the Company with copies of any
written comments or responses submitted by Purchaser and Parent in response
thereto.

 

(g) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, merger,
issuer tender offer, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to
Company Common Stock occurring on or after the Agreement Date and prior to
Purchasers acceptance for payment of, and payment for, Company Common Stock
tendered in the Offer, and such adjustment to the Offer Price shall provide to
the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such action and shall as so adjusted from and after
the date of such event, be the Offer Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 1.1(g)_ shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action with respect to the Company Common Stock that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



4 (h) Subject in all respects to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Offer Conditions, Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any
shares of Company Common Stock that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer.

1.2(a)_ to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act concurrently with the dissemination of the
Schedule TO to the holders of Company Common Stock by Purchaser. Except with
respect to any amendments filed in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or
after a Change in Company Board Recommendation, the Company agrees to provide
Purchaser, Parent and their counsel reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and
the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by Purchaser, Parent and their counsel. Each of the Company, Purchaser

date, and of those persons who become record or beneficial 

 



5  owners subsequent to such date, together with other readily available

such other assistance as Purchaser, Parent or their agents may reasonably
request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of

Section 2.6  _Company Equity Awards_.

(a) _Company Options_. Neither Purchaser nor Parent shall assume, continue or
substitute for any Company Option any option for Purchaser or Parent stock,
in connection with the Offer, Merger or any other Transactions. As of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence
of the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of any
optionholder, each Company Option (whether vested or unvested) shall be
canceled, with each former holder of any such canceled Company Option becoming
entitled to receive, within five Business Days following the Effective Time,
in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option, an amount in
cash (without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholdings
and any Tax as contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 2.9_), equal to the product
of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per share of such Company Option _multiplied by_ (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock

 



7  underlying such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if the exercise price per share of any such
Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such
Company Option shall be canceled and terminated without any cash payment being
made in respect thereof. For purposes of the foregoing, the determination of
vesting and the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying a
performance-based Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement based on
actual performance through the date that is three Business Days prior to the
Merger Closing Date.

(b) _Single-Trigger Company RSUs_. As of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time, and without
any action on the part of any holder of the applicable Company RSU, each
Company RSU held by a non-employee director of the Company and the Applicable
Percentage of each Specified Company RSU that, in each case, is then-
outstanding and unvested shall be converted into an amount in cash (without
interest and subject to deduction for any required withholdings and any Tax as
contemplated in  _Section_ __ _ 2.9_), equal to the product of (i) the
Merger Consideration _multiplied by_ (ii) (A) in the case of a Company RSU
held by a non-employee director, the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock then underlying such Company RSU, and (B) in the case of a Specified
Company RSU, the number of shares of Company Common Stock (rounded up to the
nearest whole share) equal to the product of (1) the Applicable Percentage
_multiplied by_ (2) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then
underlying such Specified Company RSU, with such amount payable by the
Surviving Corporation to each former holder of any such Company RSU within
five Business Days following the Effective Time. For purposes of the
foregoing, the determination of vesting and the number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying a performance-based Specified Company RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be determined in accordance with the
applicable award agreement based on actual performance through the date that
is three Business Days prior to the Merger Closing Date.

 

(c) _Other Company RSUs_. As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, and without any action
on the part of any holder of a Company RSU, each Company RSU (other than any
Company RSU or any portion of a Company RSU settled pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.6(b)_) that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled at the Effective Time, and shall be converted into:

(i) an amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for any
required withholdings and any Tax as contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 2.9_),
equal to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration _multiplied by_ (B) the
applicable Cash Out Number, with such amount payable by the Surviving
Corporation to each former holder of any such Company RSU within five Business
Days following the Effective Time; and

 

(ii) the right to receive, on the same vesting schedule (and subject to
continued employment through the applicable vesting dates) as the
corresponding Company RSU, an amount in cash (without interest and subject to
deduction for any required withholding Tax as contemplated in _Section_ __ _
2.9_), equal to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration _multiplied by_
(B) the

 



8  applicable Rollover Number. Except as set forth in this _Section_ __ _
2.6(c)(ii)_, the cash amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence
shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including continued
service through the applicable vesting dates) as applied to the corresponding
Company RSU converted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.6(c)(ii)_ immediately
prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any such awards
that were subject to performance-based vesting shall vest solely on the basis
of service following the Effective Time.

 

(iii) Any portion of a performance-based Company RSU that is not deemed to be
earned in accordance with (A)  _Section 2.6(b)_ or this _Section_ __ _
2.6(c)_ and (B) the applicable award agreement will be terminated as of the
Effective Time for no consideration.

 

(iv) For purposes of this Agreement: (A) " __ _Total Number_ __" means, (1)
for each service-based Company RSU, the number of shares of Company Common
Stock underlying such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(2) for each performance-based Company RSU, the number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying such Company RSU as determined in accordance with the
applicable award agreement based on actual performance through the date that
is three Business Days prior to the Merger Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that for purposes of any Specified Company RSU, the Total Number
shall be reduced by the portion of such Specified Company RSU settled pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(b)_; (B) " __ _Rollover Number_ __" means, for
each Company RSU, the number of shares of Company Common Stock (rounded up to
the nearest whole number of shares) equal to the product of (1) the Total
Number _multiplied by_ (2) the Rollover Factor; (C) " __ _Cash Out Number_
__" means, for each Company RSU, the number of shares of Company Common Stock
equal to (1) the Total Number _minus_ (2) the Rollover Number; and (D) " __
_Rollover Factor_ __" means a number, carried out to four decimal places,
equal to the quotient of (1) $30,000,000 _divided by_ (2) the product of (x)
the Merger Consideration _multiplied by_ (y) the excess of the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock underlying Company RSUs immediately prior to
the Effective Time, after giving effect to the determination of performance
with respect to all performance-based Company RSUs, _over_ the number of
shares of Company Common Stock underlying any Company RSU (or portion
thereof) settled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(b)_.

(v) For the avoidance of doubt, for each Company RSU, the allocation between
the Cash Out Number and the Rollover Number shall occur with respect to each
unvested tranche of such Company RSU.

 

(d) _Company ESPP_. Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company
Board (or, if applicable, any committee thereof administering the Company
ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other necessary actions to
provide that, with respect to any outstanding Offering Period(s) (as such term
is defined in Section 2.1(p) of the Company ESPP) under the Company ESPP as

9  ESPP may increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction
election from that in effect on the Agreement Date for such Offering Period(s)
and no new participants may participate in the ESPP; (ii) following the
purchase of Company Common Stock pursuant to any Offering Period(s) that end
prior to the Effective Time, no new Offering Period shall be commenced under
the Company ESPP prior to the Effective Time; (iii) any such Offering

shall terminate and a Purchase Date (as such term is defined in Section 2.1(x)
of the Company ESPP) shall occur under the Company ESPP immediately prior
to the Effective Time with respect to such Offering Period(s) (the " __
_Shortened Offering Period_ __"); and (iv) immediately prior to, and subject
to the occurrence of the Effective Time, the Company ESPP shall terminate.

(e) _Further Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering any Stock Plan) shall take
such actions as are necessary to approve and effectuate the foregoing
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, including making any determinations
and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof or any
administrator of a Stock Plan as may be necessary and delivering appropriate
notices. The Company shall provide Parent with documentation evidencing the
completion of the foregoing actions (the form and substance of
such documentation shall be subject to review and approval by Parent, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) not later
than the Business Day preceding the Effective Time.

 

(f) _Certain Tax Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any Company RSU that immediately
prior to such cancellation was treated as "nonqualified deferred compensation"
subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the applicable settlement
date or dates for such Company RSU, as applicable, in accordance with the
terms of the existing applicable award agreement if required in order to
comply with Section 409A of the Code.

 

Section 2.7 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time,
(a) all shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including any Dissenting Shares) shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and all

Share_ __"), that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, in each case, cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company;
and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect
to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock
shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time.

 

Section 2.8 _Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) On or prior to the Merger Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as payment
agent in the Merger (the " __ _Payment Agent_ __"). At the Effective Time or
as promptly as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than 9:00 a.m.,
New York City time, on the Business Day following the Effective Time), Parent
shall deposit with the Payment Agent cash sufficient to

 



10  pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.5_. The cash amount so deposited with the Payment Agent is referred to as
the " __ _Payment Fund_ __." The Payment Agent will invest the funds included
in the Payment Fund in the manner directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Any interest or
other income resulting from the investment of such funds shall be the property
of Parent.

(b) Within five Business Days after the Effective Time, the Payment Agent will
mail to the Persons who were record holders of Company Stock Certificates or
Book Entry Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than to
holders of Dissenting Shares to the extent such holders do not also hold
Shares that are not Dissenting Shares): (i) a letter of transmittal
in customary form reasonably acceptable to the Company that shall specify
that delivery of such Company Stock Certificates or transfer of such Book
Entry Shares shall be deemed to have occurred, and risk of loss and title to
the Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares, as applicable, shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Stock Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of the Book Entry Shares to
the Payment Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Company Stock Certificates or transfer of the Book Entry Shares in exchange
for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the
Payment Agent for exchange, together with a duly completed and validly
executed letter of transmittal or receipt of an "agents message" by the
Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer to the Payment
Agent as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book Entry
Shares, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of
transmittal or, in each case, such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Payment Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, subject to any required withholding of Taxes as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 2.9_, the Merger Consideration; and (B) the Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Share so surrendered shall be canceled. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.8(b)_, each Company
Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration
as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.5_. No interest shall be paid or accrued
on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of any Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Share. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of any Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and to deliver a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against the Payment Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such Company Stock Certificate. Upon the making of such affidavit
and delivering such bond, the Payment Agent will issue, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, the Merger Consideration
to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Company Stock Certificate as contemplated under this
_Article_ __ _ II_.

 



11 (c) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed or undistributed to
holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares as of the date
that is 12 months after the Merger Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent
upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates (other than with
respect to any Dissenting Shares) who have not surrendered their Company
Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
2.8_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction
of their claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.8_. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common
Stock two years after the Effective Time (or, if earlier, immediately prior to
such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Body) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder of any Company Stock Certificate or to any other Person with respect to
any Merger Consideration delivered to any public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property Law, escheat Law or similar Law.

Section 2.9 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Payment Agent, Purchaser,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Offer Price, Merger Consideration or any other payments made in
connection with this Agreement, as applicable, payable to any holder of any
shares of Company Common Stock, any holder of any Company Equity Award or any
other recipient pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law or under any other applicable Law. To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

Section 2.10 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has properly made and
perfected a demand for appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as " __ _Dissenting Shares_ __"
until such time as such holder effectively withdraws or fails to perfect or
otherwise loses such holder s appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.5_, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to
a holder of Dissenting Shares. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL.

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into
and shall represent only the right to

 



12  receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.5_,
without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificate
representing such shares or transfer of such Book Entry Share, as the case
may be, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.8_.

(c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt written notice of (A) any
demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the DGCL; (B) any withdrawal or attempted withdrawal of any such
demand; and (C) any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL; and (ii) the
opportunity and right to control any and all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demand, notice or instrument; _provided_ that neither
party shall, without the prior written consent of the other party, voluntarily
make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer to settle, any such
demands or applications, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written
demand for appraisal or agree to do any of the foregoing. Each holder of
Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled under Section 262 of the DGCL to
receive payment of the "fair value" for such holders shares shall receive
such payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation after giving effect to
any withholdings or deductions required by applicable Law (but only after the
amount thereof shall have been finally determined pursuant to the DGCL).

 

Section 2.11 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Purchaser, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take and shall take
such action.

the Company Disclosure Letter (each section of which qualifies the
correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or covenant to the extent
specified therein, _provided_ that any disclosure set forth with respect to
any particular section shall be deemed to be disclosed in reference to all
other applicable sections of this Agreement if the disclosure in respect of
the particular section is sufficient on its face to inform Parent of the

the applicability of the disclosure to such other sections) delivered by the
Company to Parent on the Agreement Date (the " __ _Company Disclosure Letter_
__"), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser and Parent as
follows:

Section 3.1 _Organization_.

 

(a) Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company (the " _Company
Subsidiaries_ ") is a corporation, limited liability company or limited

standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. Each of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified and/or licensed to do
business as a foreign corporation, limited liability company or limited
partnership, and, where applicable, is in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the leasing of
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 



13 (b) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has all requisite power
and authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits,
authorizations and approvals (collectively, the " _Permits_ ") and has made
all filings required under applicable Law necessary to enable it to own,
operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now
conducted, except for such Permits or filings, the lack of which, would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) The copies of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
amended and restated bylaws of the Company which are included as  _Section_
__ _ 3.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Company Charter

all amendments thereto as in effect on the Agreement Date. For each
Significant Subsidiary, the Company has made available to Parent true and
correct copies of the articles of incorporation (including any certificate of

the Agreement Date. Neither the Company nor any Significant Subsidiary is in
violation of any of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or by-
laws (or equivalent constituent documents), including all amendments thereto,

individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

the Company may vote. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a
party to any Contracts relating to the voting of any Company securities or

issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding, and (ii) there are no
outstanding securities, options, equity or equity-based compensation,

office actions received by the Company or any Company Subsidiary from the

during ex parte prosecution of any applications included in Company
Registered Intellectual Property).

(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, (i) the Company or one of the Company Subsidiaries is the
sole and exclusive owner of the Company Intellectual Property, free and clear
of all Liens other than Permitted Liens, and (ii) the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have sufficient right to use all Intellectual Property Rights
used in or held for use in the conduct of the business of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as currently conducted. The foregoing clause (ii) does
not constitute a non-infringement representation, which is covered by the
representations in the next paragraph below.

 

(e) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, neither the Company Products, nor the operation of the
business of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries have infringed,
misappropriated, or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property Rights of any
Person, or have violated any right of any Person (including any right to
privacy or publicity), or have constituted, unfair competition or trade
practices under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction. There is no current
unresolved Legal Proceeding that has been filed against the Company or any
Company Subsidiary by any third party in which it is alleged that any Company
Product or the operation of the business of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates the Intellectual

any right

 



26  to privacy or publicity), or constitutes unfair competition or trade
practices under the applicable Law. Except as would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, there has been no actual written
(or, to the Knowledge of the Company, unwritten) notice from or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, notice from, or Legal Proceeding brought
by, any third party in the three years prior to the Agreement Date in which
it is alleged that any Company Product or the operation of the business of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, infringes, misappropriates or otherwise
violates the Intellectual Property Rights of any Person, violates the rights
of any Person (including any right to privacy or publicity), or constitutes
unfair competition or trade practices under the applicable Law.

 

(f) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, to the Knowledge of the Company, during the past three years,
no Person has misappropriated, infringed or otherwise violated or is currently
misappropriating, infringing or otherwise violating any Company Intellectual
Property that is material to the conduct of the business of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has brought any Legal Proceeding against any third party with
respect to the misappropriation, infringement or other violation of any
Company Intellectual Property which remains unresolved as of the Agreement
Date.

(g) There are no settlements, covenants not to sue, consents, judgments, or
orders or similar obligations resulting from an actual or threatened legal
dispute to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary was involved, involving

now bound that: (i) restrict in any material manner the rights of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary to use any material Company Intellectual Property in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; (ii) restrict
the business of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in any material manner
in order to accommodate a third partys Intellectual Property Rights; or (iii)
permit third parties to use any material Company Intellectual Property.

consultants and contractors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary who have

Rights arising therefrom became the exclusive property of the Company or such
Company Subsidiary or (ii) pursuant to written agreements assigning all
Intellectual Property Rights arising therefrom to the Company or such Company
Subsidiary (excluding moral rights and, in the case of non-employees, subject
to statutory reversionary rights, in each case to the extent such rights
cannot be assigned or waived pursuant to applicable Law). The Company and
the Company Subsidiaries have taken reasonable measures to protect the
confidentiality of the material Trade Secrets included in the Company
Intellectual Property with respect to which the Company wishes to maintain as
confidential and are not disclosed by the Companys Registered Intellectual
Property filings or Company Products, including by having a policy requiring
each employee, consultant and contractor of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary and any other Person with access to such Trade Secrets to execute
a confidentiality agreement, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there has
not been any material breach by any party to such confidentiality agreements.

 



27 (i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, (a) all Company Software embodied in or used in connection
with the Company Products that are commercially released as of the Agreement
Date substantially perform in accordance with their documented, published
specifications and generally as the Company or any Company Subsidiary has
warranted to its customers, and (b) the commercially released Company Products
do not contain any Malicious Code.

or condition exists, that, with or without the passage of time or giving of
notice, requires: (i) the deposit of any material Source Code owned by Company
or Company Subsidiaries for any commercially released Company Product with an
escrow agent or escrow service other than source code escrows made in
the ordinary course of business; (ii) the disclosure of any such material
Source Code owned by Company or Company Subsidiaries to any Person other than
employees and contractors for use in the course of providing services to the
Company or Company Subsidiaries; or (iii) a grant to any Person a license or
right under any such material Source Code owned by Company or Company

portion of Source Code owned by Company or Company Subsidiaries for any
commercially released Company Product has been disclosed to any Person who is
not an employee or consultant of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or who
is not subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations regarding such
Source Code. This paragraph does not apply to any Source Code owned by Company

source, "copyleft," freeware, shareware, or similar distribution model.

(k) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, (i) the Company IT Systems are generally designed,

Company or any Company Subsidiary, (iii) the Company IT Systems do not
contain any Malicious Code, (iv) the Company and each Company Subsidiary has
disaster recovery plans and procedures that are designed, and can be

(l) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, the Company and each Company Subsidiary has implemented (i)
administrative, physical and technical safeguards designed to protect Personal
Data from unauthorized access, use, acquisition, alteration, loss and
destruction, and (ii) policies, procedures and IT Systems designed to protect
the security, integrity, availability and confidentiality of Personal Data, in
each case relative to the sensitivity of the Personal Data, Company and the
Company Subsidiaries size and complexity and the nature and scope of their 

 



28  activities. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, to the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company,
Company Subsidiaries nor any of their service providers has suffered any
breach in security that has permitted or resulted in any unauthorized access
to, disclosure of, loss of, misappropriation of, or misuse of Personal Data.
In the collection and processing by the Company or any Company Subsidiary of
any Personal Data, and except as would not reasonably be expected to result in
a material liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Company, each
Company Subsidiary, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, their
service providers, have complied in all material respects with applicable
Information Privacy Laws and the privacy policies of the Company and such
Company Subsidiary. No Legal Proceeding has been filed or commenced or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing against, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or their service providers alleging any failure to comply
with any applicable Information Privacy Laws that would reasonably be expected
to result in a material liability to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For each third party service provider that
processes Personal Data (" __ _Vendors_ __"), except as would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and each
Company Subsidiary have (i) taken steps to select and retain only such
Vendors that are reasonably expected to be capable of maintaining the
confidentiality, security and integrity of such Personal Data, taking into
account pertinent factors such as the sensitivity of the Personal Data, nature
and scope of the Vendors activities, the cost involved, the availability of
alternative third party service providers and the size and complexity of the
Vendors business and (ii) required each such Vendor by contract to agree to
confidentiality obligations designed to protect the Personal Data to which the
Vendor has been given access in compliance with applicable
Information Privacy Laws.

(m) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, immediately subsequent to the Effective Time, the
Intellectual Property Rights owned by third parties and licensed to the
Company or a Company Subsidiary which are used in the business of the Company
or a Company Subsidiary and the Company IT Systems owned by third parties
which are used by the Company or a Company Subsidiary in the operation of the
business shall be licensed by or available for use by the Company or such
Company Subsidiary on terms and conditions substantially similar, in all
material respects, to those under which the Company or such Company
Subsidiary licensed or used such Intellectual Property Rights or Company IT
Systems immediately prior to the Effective Time.

the SEC, at any time such document is amended or supplemented or at the time
such document is first published, sent or given to the Companys
stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading.

 



35 Section 4.7 _Financing_.

 

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company a
true, complete and correct copy of (i) an executed commitment letter, dated
as of the date of this Agreement, including all exhibits, schedules and
annexes thereto (as amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or extended from
time to time after the date of this Agreement in compliance with  _Section_
__ _ 5.15_, the " __ _Commitment Letter_ __"), from the Lenders, pursuant to
which the Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to
provide the debt amounts set forth therein (the debt financing contemplated
by the Commitment Letter, together with any permitted Alternative Debt
Financing, is collectively referred to in this Agreement as the " __ _Debt
Financing_ __") and (ii) the fee letter referred to in the Commitment Letter
(with only fee amounts, pricing caps and other economic terms redacted (none
of which would adversely affect the amount or availability of the Debt
Financing)) (each as amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or extended
from time to time after the date of this Agreement in compliance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.15_, the " __ _Fee Letter_ __"). The copies of the
Commitment Letter and Fee Letter attached hereto as _Schedule 4.7(ii)_ and
_Schedule 4.7(ii)_ are true, accurate and complete copies of the Commitment
Letter and Fee Letter (subject to redaction as described above) as in effect
on the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter (or in the
unredacted portions of the Fee Letter) delivered to the Company, as of the
date of this Agreement, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations
of the Lenders to provide the Debt Financing or any contingencies that would
permit the Lenders to reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing. There are
no other agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the Debt
Financing to which Parent or any of its subsidiaries is a party as of the date
of this Agreement which would impose conditions to the funding in full of the
Financing, other than those set forth in the Commitment Letter (or in the
unredacted portions of the Fee Letter). As of the date of this Agreement,
assuming the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions, Parent does not have any
reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions to be satisfied by it in the Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter at
the time it is required to consummate the Offer Closing or the Merger Closing
hereunder, nor does Parent have Knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement,
that any of the Lenders will not perform their respective funding obligations
under the Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms and conditions.

 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the Commitment Letter is a valid,
binding obligation (subject to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and equitable
principles of general applicability) of Parent and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, the other parties thereto, (ii) the Commitment Letter is in full force
and effect and (iii) assuming the satisfaction of the condition contained in
Section (c)(ii) of _Annex A_ , no event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part
of Parent or any of its Affiliates under the terms and conditions of the
Commitment Letter and Fee Letter. Parent has paid in full or will pay in full
on or before the 

 



36  Offer Closing any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid
pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter and Fee Letter on or before the
Offer Closing. The Commitment Letter and Fee Letter have not been modified,
altered or amended on or prior to the date of this Agreement. None of the
commitments under the Commitment Letter have been withdrawn or rescinded prior
to the date of this Agreement.

 

(d) Assuming the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions, the proceeds of the
Debt Financing, if funded, together with available cash of Parent, Purchaser
and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, shall constitute sufficient
funds for the satisfaction of all of Parents and Purchasers obligations
under this Agreement on the Offer Closing Date, including the payment of
the Offer Price in respect of each share of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and accepted in the Offer, the Merger Consideration and all other
amounts to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ and  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_
and the payment of all associated costs and expenses of the Offer and the
Merger (including any repayment or refinancing of indebtedness of the Company
required in connection therewith).

 

(e) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing) by Parent or any
Affiliate thereof be a condition to any of Parents obligations hereunder.

Section 4.8 _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Purchaser is entering into the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder,
delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Parents and
Purchasers obligation to consummate the Offer and the Merger, Parent and its
subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) will be Solvent after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Debt Financing and
payment of all related fees and expenses. As used in this _Section_ __ _
4.8_, the term " _Solvent_ " means, with respect to any person as of a
particular date, that on such date, (a) the sum of the assets, at a fair
valuation, of such person will exceed its debts, (b) such person has not
incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as such debts mature, and
(c) such person does not have unreasonably small capital with which to
conduct their business. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_, "debt"
means any liability whether or not reduced to judgment, liquidated,
unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed,
legal, equitable, secured or unsecured. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _
4.8_, the amount of any unliquidated or contingent liabilities at any time
shall be the maximum amount which, in light of all the facts
and circumstances existing at such time, could reasonably be expected to
become an actual or matured liability.

Section 4.9 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. None of Parent, Purchaser or
any of their respective controlled Affiliates beneficially owns (as such term
is used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) or owns (as such
term is used in Section 203 of the DGCL) any Company Common Stock or any
options, warrants or other rights to acquire Company Common Stock or other
securities of, or any other economic interest (through derivatives, securities
or otherwise) in the Company.

Section 4.10 _No Vote Required_. No vote or consent of the holders of any
class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this
Agreement, the Merger, the Offer or any of the Transactions. The vote or
consent of Parent as the sole stockholder of Purchaser

 



37  (which has been obtained) is the only vote or consent of the holders of any
class or series of capital stock of Purchaser necessary to approve this
Agreement, the Merger, the Offer or any of the Transactions.

Section 4.11 _Management Agreements_. Other than this Agreement, as of the
date hereof, there are no Contracts, undertakings, commitments or obligations
between Parent or Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and any stockholder of the Company, member of the Companys
management or the board of directors, on the other hand, relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the management of the Company
after the Effective Time.

Section 4.12  _No Other Company Representations and Warranties_. Except as
set forth in _Article_ __ _ III_ and as contemplated by clause (c)(vi) of
_Annex A_ , each of Parent and the Purchaser acknowledges that the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries are not making any representation or warranty of any
kind whatsoever, express or implied, at law or in equity, with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions or with respect to any other information
provided to Parent or Purchaser in connection with the Transactions,
including the accuracy and completion thereof.

assist, participate, facilitate or encourage any Acquisition Proposal or
proposal or inquiry that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, an Acquisition Proposal, or, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_, (i)
conduct or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, disclose any non-

Agreement, or (iv) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the

this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ by the Company. The Company shall, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to

destruction of) all such information.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ to the contrary, at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time, in response to an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition

 



43  Proposal made after the Agreement Date, and not resulting from a breach of
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_, that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel)
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal,
the Company may, upon a good faith determination by the Company Board (after
consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable
Law: (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and such
Persons Representatives); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and such
Person enter into a customary confidentiality agreement containing customary
"standstill" provisions and such other terms no less favorable to the Company
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _further_
, that any non-public information concerning the Company or any Company
Subsidiary provided or made available to the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal shall, to the extent not previously provided to Purchaser or Parent,
be provided or made available to Purchaser or Parent as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) after it is provided to such
Person making such Acquisition Proposal; and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall promptly advise Parent in writing, in no event later than 24 hours
after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, and shall indicate the identity of
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its ultimate parent entity,
the terms and conditions of any proposal or offer, the nature of any
inquiries or contacts, and all written materials relating to such Acquisition
Proposal, and shall inform Parent within 24 hours of any proposed change(s) to
the price or other material terms thereof affecting the status of any such
Acquisition Proposal.

(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw,
amend, qualify, fail to make or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or
publicly withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify, fail to publicly reaffirm, in the
event that any Acquisition Proposal has become publicly known or been
delivered to the Company Board and Parent has requested such reaffirmation or
in the event of media rumors or speculation with respect thereto, within the
later of (A) two Business Days of such request and (B) the end of the Notice
Period then in effect (or that comes into effect within two Business Days of
such request), if any, taking into account any extensions thereto, or modify,
in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve,
endorse, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, adopt
or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal, (iii) fail to
recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer (other than
the Offer or any other tender offer or exchange offer by Parent or Purchaser)
for the Company Common Stock within ten Business Days after the commencement
of such offer (each of the foregoing being referred to as a " _Change in
Company Board Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the determination (but not the adoption, approval, recommendation or
endorsement) by the Company Board that an Acquisition Proposal is or would be
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal shall not in itself be deemed
a "Change in Company Board Recommendation" and the Company Board may, at any
time prior to the Acceptance Time, take any of the actions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)(i)_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)(ii)_ below ( _provided_
,  _however_ , __ that prior to taking any such action, the Company complies
with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_ of this Agreement):

 

(i) if there is an Intervening Event, effect a Change in Company Board
Recommendation if the Company Board concludes in good faith,

 



44  after consultation with the Companys financial advisor and outside counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

(ii) effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation in response to an
Acquisition Proposal if (A) the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, (B) the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys financial advisor and outside counsel, that the Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (C) prior to effecting such
Change in Company Board Recommendation, the Company complies with _Section_
__ _ 5.3(d)_ of this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.3(c)_, the Company shall not be entitled to make a Change in Company Board
Recommendation unless: (A) the Company shall have first provided prompt prior
written notice, and in any event at least four Business Days prior to making
a Change in Company Board Recommendation (the " _Notice Period_ ") to Parent
of its intention to make a Change in Company Board Recommendation (a "
_Recommendation Change Notice_ "), which notice shall , if the basis for the
proposed action by the Company Board is not related to a Superior Proposal,
contain a description of the Intervening Event giving rise to such proposed
action or, if the basis for the proposed action by the Company Board is a
Superior Proposal contain a description of the material terms and conditions
of the Superior Proposal forming the basis for the proposed action by the
Company Board, including the most current version of the agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal (which description and summary shall be
updated on a prompt basis) in the form to be entered into and the identity of
the third party making the Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed
that the delivery of any such notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed
to be a Change in Company Board Recommendation); (B) the Company shall, and
shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period,
permit Parent to make proposals to the Company Board regarding amendments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and negotiate in good faith with
Parent with respect thereto, so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal or the Intervening Event no longer forms the
basis for the Company Board to effect a Change in Company Board
Recommendation, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make such amendments
(it being understood and agreed (x) that in the event that, after
commencement of the Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms
of a Superior Proposal including any revision in price, the Notice Period
shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least two Business Days
remains in the Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies
Parent of any such material revision and (y) that there may be multiple
extensions of the Notice Period) and (C) Parent does not make, within the
Notice Period, a proposal that is determined by the Company Board (after
consultation with the Companys financial advisor and outside counsel), to
cause the Intervening Event to no longer form the basis for the Company Board
to effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation or cause the offer
previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal, as applicable.

 



45 (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i)
taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after
consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_ shall not affect
the obligations of the Company and the Company Board and the rights of
Purchaser and Parent under _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_ and _Section_ __ _
5.3(d)_, to the extent applicable to such disclosure (it being understood that
neither any "stop, look and listen" letter or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, nor any accurate
disclosure of factual information (other than the Company or the
Company Board taking any action set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_) to the Companys stockholders that is required to be
made to such stockholders under applicable Law or in satisfaction of the
Company Boards fiduciary duties or applicable Law, shall be deemed to be a
Change in Company Board Recommendation).

Merger, subject to advice of such partys counsel; and (D) request early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act and take all other actions
reasonably necessary consistent with this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ to avoid the
entry of a Restraint and to cause, as soon as reasonably possible (and in any
event, not later than the Outside Date), the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law
relating to the Offer and the Merger and the occurrence of the Effective
Time. In connection with the foregoing, each party hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts: (w) to give the other party reasonable prior notice
of any communication with, and any proposed understanding or agreement with,
any Governmental Body regarding any investigations, proceedings, filings,
forms, declarations, notifications, registrations or notices, and permit the
other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views
of the other in connection with, any proposed communication, understanding or
agreement with any Governmental Body, in each case under any Antitrust Law
relating to the Offer and the Merger, subject to an appropriate
confidentiality agreement and the advice of such partys antitrust counsel;

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all action necessary to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter and Fee Letter,
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Commitment Letter and Fee Letter in accordance with their terms until the
funding of the Debt Financing at or prior to the Offer Closing, (ii)
negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the "
_Definitive Agreements_ ") on terms and conditions not less favorable, in the
aggregate, than those contained in the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter
(including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter)
and (iii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, obtain the waiver of) on
a timely basis (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing
Period) all conditions in the Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter and the
Definitive Agreements applicable to and within the control of Purchaser
(excluding any condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a result of
the Companys breach of this Agreement) and comply with its obligations
thereunder. In the event that all conditions contained in the Commitment
Letter, the Fee Letter and the Definitive Agreements have been satisfied and
Parent is required to consummate the Offer Closing, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause each Lender to fund its respective committed
portion of the Debt Financing required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses. Parent
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), permit any amendment or
modification to, or any waiver of any provision (including any remedy) under,
or voluntarily replace (it being understood that any Alternative Debt
Financing shall not be deemed a voluntary replacement for purposes of this
sentence), the Commitment Letter or Fee Letter if such amendment,
modification, or waiver or voluntary replacement (w) reduces the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing intended to be funded in connection with the
Offer Closing and/or Merger Closing, (x) adds new (or adversely modifies
any existing) conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing as
compared to those in the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter as in effect on
the date of this Agreement, (y) adversely affects the ability of Parent to
enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letter and the Fee
Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative
to the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against such other parties to
the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter as in effect on the date hereof, or
(z) would otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially
delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or (ii) result in the termination of the Debt Financing or
Commitment Letter unless such Commitment Letter is replaced with an
Alternative Debt Financing; provided, that for the avoidance of doubt no
consent from the Company shall be required for: (A) any
amendment, replacement, supplement or modification of the Commitment Letter
and the Fee Letter that is limited to adding lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter as of the date of this Agreement
(including in replacement of a Lender), (B) implementation or exercise of any
"flex" provisions provided in the Fee Letter as in effect as of the date
hereof or (C) any amendment, replacement, supplement or modification to the
Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter so long as such action would not be
prohibited by the foregoing clauses (w)-(z).

 



52 (b) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable,
regardless of the reason therefor (other than a breach by the Company of this
Agreement), which prevents the consummation of all or any portion of the Debt
Financing, Parent will (1) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain on a
timely basis alternative debt financing (the " _Alternative Debt Financing_
") (in an amount sufficient, assuming the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions
and when taken together with available cash on hand of Parent, Purchaser and
the Company and Company Subsidiaries and/or equity financing and any then-
available Debt Financing pursuant to any then-existing Commitment Letter, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related
fees and expenses earned, due and payable as of the Offer Closing) from the
same or other sources and which do not include any incremental conditions to
the consummation of such alternative debt financing that are materially more
onerous to Parent or the Company (in the aggregate) than the conditions set
forth in the Commitment Letter in effect as of the date of this Agreement
(provided that Parent shall not be obligated to obtain financing on terms or
conditions materially less favorable (taking into account any flex provisions)
to Parent than those contained in the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter
that the Alternative Debt Financing would replace) and (2) promptly notify the
Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor.

 

(c) For purposes of the foregoing _Section_ __ _ 5.15(a)_ and _Section_ __ _
5.15(b)_, (i) the term " _Commitment Letter_ " shall be deemed to include any
commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any alternative debt
financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any commitment letters
remaining in effect at the time in question), (ii) the term " _Fee Letter_ "
shall be deemed to include any fee letter (or similar agreement) with respect
to any alternative debt financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any fee
letters remaining in effect at the time in question), and (iii) the term "
_Lenders_ " shall be deemed to include any lenders providing the alternative
debt financing arranged in compliance herewith. Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its
efforts to consummate the Debt Financing. Parent shall provide the Company
with prompt written notice of (A) any breach or default by any party to any
Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements of which Parent gains
knowledge and (B) the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Lender, guarantor, or other financing source with
respect to any actual or potential breach or default or, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letters or the Definitive
Agreements or any provision thereof and any material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to any of the Commitment Letters or the
Definitive Agreements with respect to the obligation to fund the Debt
Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at Closing, in each
case that would reasonably be expected to result in any portion of the Debt
Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby not
being available at the Acceptance Time if such portion is reasonably required
to fund the transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent shall, directly or indirectly, make all proceeds of the Debt Financing
received by Parent available to Purchaser as are required for Purchaser to
perform its obligations hereunder (including with respect to the consummation
of the Offer and the payment for shares tendered thereby).

prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger; and

(c) _Offer_. Purchaser (or Parent on Purchasers behalf) shall have accepted
for payment and paid for all of the Shares validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither

Section 6.2 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_ _._ None of the Company,
Purchaser or Parent may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in

covenants, obligations or agreements under this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII

Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer and
the Merger may be abandoned (other than in the case of  _Section_ __ _
7.1(a)_) by written notice of the terminating party to the other parties:

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company at any time prior to
the Acceptance Time;

 



56 (b) by either Parent or the Company if the Acceptance Time shall have not been

2017 (the " _Outside Date_ "), including as a result of any extensions of the
Expiration Date pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.1(d)_; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that: (A) a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ if the failure of the Acceptance Time
to occur prior to the Outside Date was proximately attributable to a material
breach or inaccuracy of any of such partys representations, warranties,
covenants, obligations or agreements hereunder such that the other party has
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(g)_, as applicable; and (B) the Company shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)_ unless
the Company shall have made any payment required to be made to Parent
pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ ;

(c) by either Parent or the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time
if any final, non-appealable Restraint shall be in effect enjoining,
restraining, preventing, prohibiting or making illegal the making of the
Offer, the acceptance for payment of, and payment for, the Shares pursuant to
the Offer or consummation of the Merger;

(d) by Parent at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if a Triggering Event

accepted shares of Company Common Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer;
_provided_ , _however_ , that: (A) a party shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)_ if: (1) the
failure of Purchaser to accept shares of Company Common Stock for payment
pursuant to the Offer is attributable to the failure of an Offer Condition to
be satisfied; and (2) the failure of such Offer Condition to be satisfied is
proximately attributable to a material breach or inaccuracy of any of
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or agreements hereunder
of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement such that the other party has
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(g)_, as applicable; and (B) the Company shall not be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(e)_ unless
the Company shall have made any payment required to be made to
Parent pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ ;

(f) by Parent at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if (i) there shall have
been a material breach of any covenant, obligation or agreement on the part
of the Company set forth in this Agreement; or (ii) any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth in _Article_ __ _ III_ of this Agreement
shall have been inaccurate when made or, if not made as of a specific date,
shall have become inaccurate, that would, in the case of both clauses (i) and
(ii), (A) result in the Offer Conditions set forth in _Section (c)(ii)_ or 
_Section (c)(iii)_ of _Annex A_ not being satisfied, and (B) such breach is
not curable by the Outside Date, or, if curable through the exercise of
commercially reasonable efforts, is not cured within 15 Business Days of the
date Parent gives the Company notice of such breach or inaccuracy; _provided_
, _however_ , that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)_ if Purchaser 

 



57  or Parent is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants, obligations or agreements hereunder such that the
Company has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1(g)_;

(g) by the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if (i)
there shall have been a material breach of any covenant, obligation or
agreement on the part of Purchaser or Parent set forth in this Agreement; or
(ii) any representation or warranty of Purchaser and Parent set forth in 
_Article_ __ _ IV_ of this Agreement shall have been inaccurate when made or,
if not made as of a specific date, shall have become inaccurate, that would,
in the case of both clauses (i) and (ii), (A) have a material adverse effect
on the ability of Purchaser or Parent to consummate the Offer, and (B) such
breach is not curable by the Outside Date, or, if curable through the exercise
of commercially reasonable efforts, is not cured within 15 Business Days of
the date the Company gives Parent notice of such breach or inaccuracy;
_provided_ , _however_ , __ that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(g)_ if the
Company is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants, obligations or agreements hereunder such that Parent has the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_;

 

(h) by the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Time to enter into a
definitive acquisition agreement authorized by the Company Board providing
for a Superior Proposal and, concurrently with such termination, the Company

Company shall have complied with _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and prior to or

Termination Fee;

(i) by the Company (A) at any time prior to the commencement of the Offer if
Purchaser shall have failed to commence the Offer in violation of _Section_ __
_ 1.1_, provided that the Company is not then in violation of _Section
1.1(f)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 1.2_ or (B) at any time prior to the Acceptance
Time if all the Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied or waived as of the
expiration of the Offer on the Expiration Date and (B) Parent shall have
failed to consummate the Offer thereafter in accordance with _Section_ __ _
1.1(b)_; or

(j) by the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if Parent shall
have delivered one or more Financing Extensions Notice to the Company pursuant
to _Section 1.1(d)_.

 

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given to the other party or parties specifying the provision
hereof pursuant to which such termination is made (other than pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_), and this Agreement shall be of no further force or
effect, and there shall be no damages or liability on the part of Parent,
Purchaser or the Company or their respective directors, officers,
employees, stockholders, Representatives, agents or advisors or any arranger,
Lender or other provider of Debt Financing to Parent or its Affiliates, other
than, with respect to Parent, Purchaser and the Company, the obligations
pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ and _Article_ __ _ VIII_ (and
the Confidentiality Agreement) shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect and (ii) subject to
_Section 8.6(b)_ and _Section_

 



58   __ _7.3(f)_ nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability as
a result of fraud or the willful breach by such party of its representations,
warranties, covenants, obligations or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "willful breach" shall mean a
material breach that is a consequence of an act, or failure to act, undertaken
by the breaching party with the knowledge that the taking of such act, or
failure to act, would, or would be reasonably expected to, result in a breach
of this Agreement.

 

Section 7.3 _Expense Reimbursement; Termination Fees_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost
or expense. In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(e)_ or by Parent pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_ and provided that, solely with respect to _Section
7.1(b)_ and _Section 7.1(e)_ , as of such termination the Minimum Condition
has not been satisfied but all other conditions set forth in _Annex A_ and
_Article VI_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Offer Closing or the
Merger Closing, provided that such conditions are reasonably capable of being
satisfied), then the Company shall reimburse Parent $5,500,000 in respect of
expenses incurred by Parent, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Expense Reimbursement_ "), without need for supporting documentation. Any
Expense Reimbursement payment shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds
to an account designated by Parent within two Business Days of such
termination; it being understood that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Expense Reimbursement on more than one occasion.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 7.1(d)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.1(h)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent
the Company Termination Fee. The Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ shall be paid no later than the second Business
Day following termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)_ and concurrently
with any termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(h)_.

 

(c) If (i) after the Agreement Date, an Acquisition Proposal shall have become
publicly known or delivered to the Company Board and not withdrawn, (ii)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ where the failure of Purchaser to accept shares of
Company Common Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer is attributable to the
failure of the Minimum Condition to be satisfied, (B) by Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)_ where the failure of Purchaser to accept
shares of Company Common Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer is
attributable to the failure of the Minimum Condition to be satisfied or (C) by
Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_, and (iii) within twelve months
after such termination (x) the Company shall have entered into a definitive
agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or (y) any Acquisition
Transaction shall have been consummated, then the Company shall pay to Parent
the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds on the earliest
date of when such definitive agreement is executed or such transaction is
consummated; _provided_ that solely for the purposes of this Section 7.3(c),
all references to "25%" in clause (b) of the definition of "Acquisition
Transaction" shall be deemed to be references to "35%".

 



59 (d) If (i) Parent has delivered one or more Financing Extension Notices to the
Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.1(d)_ and (ii) this Agreement is
terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)_ or by the Company pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
7.1(g)_ or _Section 7.1(j)_ and immediately prior to such termination (A) all
of the Offer Conditions and the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.1(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_ have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at
the Offer Closing or the Merger Closing, provided that such conditions are
reasonably capable of being satisfied) and the Company has given notice in
writing representing that it is ready, willing and able to complete the Offer
Closing and the Merger Closing and (B) Parent and Purchaser have failed to
complete the Offer Closing or the Merger Closing by the respective date the
Offer Closing or the Merger Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to
this Agreement as a result of the full amount of the Debt Financing failing to
be funded or prospectively funded at the Offer Closing or the Merger Closing,
then Parent shall pay to the Company a fee payable in cash equal to the Parent
Termination Fee, and neither Parent nor any other Person shall (subject to the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.2_) have any further liability to the Company
or any other person with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, such payment to be made no later than two Business Days
after the termination of this Agreement; it being understood that in no event
shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

(e) All payments under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
the party to whom payment is owed.

 

(f) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section_ __
_ 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that,
without these agreements, the parties would not have entered into this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company Termination Fee and the
Parent Termination Fee shall be payable only once and not in duplication even
though such fees may be payable under one or more provisions hereof and any
payment by the Company of the Expense Reimbursement shall be credited against
the Company Termination Fee, if any, that may become payable by the Company
hereunder, and following receipt by Parent of the Company Termination Fee,
Parent shall not thereafter be entitled to receive any Expense Reimbursement.
In the event Parent shall receive the Company Termination Fee, or the Company
shall receive the Parent Termination Fee, in each case, pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_, the receipt thereof shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent,
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable,
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(and the termination thereof or any matter forming the basis for such
termination), and none of Parent, Purchaser, the Company nor any of their
respective Affiliates, as applicable shall be entitled to bring or maintain
any other Legal Proceeding or seek any other remedy against the other parties
or any of their respective direct or indirect Affiliates, equityholders,
officers, directors, advisors or other representatives, or, in the case of
Parent and Purchaser, any arranger, Lender or other provider of the Debt
Financing, arising out of this Agreement, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination. If
Parent or the Company fails promptly to pay an amount due and payable pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other
party commences an action or other proceeding that results in an award against
the Company or Parent, as the case

 



60  may be, for such amount, the non-prevailing party shall pay the prevailing
partys costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such action or proceeding, together with
interest on the amount of the applicable fee from the date such payment was
required to be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.

this Agreement or, except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, waive any of
such partys conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay

operate as a waiver of rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
such rights preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or the
exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 8.3 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Letter or in any certificate or schedule or other document

express or implied, at law or in equity, with respect to this Agreement or the

completion thereof, and Parent and Purchaser are solely relying on the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Article_ __ _
III_ in determining whether to acquire the Company and consummate the
Transactions. This Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to
create any agreement of employment with any person, to confer any rights or
remedies upon any person other than the

 



61  parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns or to
otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto, except (i) with respect
to the directors and officers of the Company covered by _Section_ __ _ 5.6_
and (ii) as to any arranger, Lender or provider of Debt Financing, the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, _Section 7.3(d)_ ,  _Section_ __ _
7.3(f)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.4_, _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ and _Section 8.6(b)_
(which shall expressly inure to the benefit of such arranger, Lender or
provider of Debt Financing and such arranger, Lender or provider shall be
entitled to rely on and enforce the provisions of such Sections).

Section 8.5  _Applicable Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement and all actions
(whether at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement,
the Offer or the Merger shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws. All actions
and proceedings (whether at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise) arising
out of or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation, validity or performance
of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger shall be heard and determined in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and the parties irrevocably
submit to the jurisdiction of such court (and, in the case of appeals, the
appropriate appellate court therefrom), in any such action or proceeding and
irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
any such action or proceeding. The parties agree that service of any court
paper may be made in any manner as may be provided under the applicable Laws
or court rules governing service of process in such court. The parties hereto
agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, each party hereto further agrees that New York State
or United States federal courts sitting in the borough of Manhattan, City of
New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any action (whether at law or
at equity and whether brought by any party hereto or any other person)
brought against any arranger, Lender or other provider of Debt Financing in
connection with the Debt Financing or this Agreement, and that no party hereto
will bring, or permit any of their affiliates to bring, any such action in any
other court. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER AT LAW, IN CONTRACT, IN TORT
OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR IN ANY ACTION
RELATING TO THE DEBT FINANCING OR INVOLVING ANY ARRANGER, LENDER OR OTHER
PROVIDER THEREOF.

Section 8.6 _Specific Enforcement_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein (including in _Section 7.3(f)_ and
_Section 8.6(b)_ ), any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a
party hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise
by a party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by
any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. The
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that, subject to _Section 7.3(f)_ and _Section 8.6(b)_, the parties hereto
shall be 

 



62  entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to (i) prevent breaches of
this Agreement and (ii) enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity, and the parties hereto hereby waive the requirement of any
posting of a bond in connection with the remedies described herein. Subject to
_Section 8.6(b)_ , the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on
the other hand, hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one
hand, or Parent or Purchaser, on the other hand, and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
Parent and Purchaser under this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 8.6(a)_ or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company shall not be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce
specifically Parents and Purchasers obligations to consummate the Offer or
the Merger unless (i) all of the Offer Conditions and the conditions set forth
in  _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_ have been satisfied
or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied or waived at the Offer Closing or the Merger Closing, provided that
such conditions are reasonably capable of being satisfied), (ii) the Company
has given notice in writing to Parent representing that it is ready, willing
and able complete the Offer Closing and the Merger Closing, (iii) the full
amount of the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Offer
Closing or the Merger Closing and (iv) Parent and Purchaser have failed to
complete the Offer Closing or the Merger Closing by the respective date the
Offer Closing or the Merger Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance and payment of the Parent Termination Fee. Furthermore, for the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section 8.6(b)_ shall not limit the Companys
ability to seek specific performance of Parents obligations pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.15_, or to seek specific performance of Parents and
Purchasers obligations to consummate the Offer and the Merger if the full
amount of the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Offer
Closing or the Merger Closing.

 

Section 8.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise),
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to
make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except
that Purchaser may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any one or more direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent without the consent of the
Company; _provided_ that no assignment shall relieve Purchaser of any of its
obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is

provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto
agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit
such term or provision, to delete

 



64  specific words or phrases or to replace such term or provision with a term

expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,

such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence,

provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to
the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid
