all purposes hereunder, unless such item or amount is by its nature adjusted

that Parent does not deliver a Notice of Objection to Buyer within such forty-
five (45) day period, Parent shall be deemed to have accepted Buyer's
calculation of the Final Cash Purchase Price set forth in the Final Closing
Statement. In connection with the preparation of the Final Closing Statement
and the Notice of Objection, each

   

party shall permit the other party and its respective Representatives to have
reasonable access to the books, records and other documents (including work
papers, schedules, financial statements and memoranda) pertaining to or used
in connection with the preparation of the Final Closing Statement, the Notice
of Objection and the calculation of the Net Working Capital, Closing Date Cash
and Closing Date Indebtedness (and provide the Representatives of each party
reasonable access to employees and accountants) to the extent reasonably
necessary to verify the accuracy of the Final Closing Statement and the Notice
of Objection. In the event that a Notice of Objection is timely delivered,
Buyer and Parent shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
for a period of thirty (30) days after a party's receipt of the Notice of
Objection, or such longer period as the Parties may agree in writing, to
resolve any disagreements set forth in the Notice of Objection.

 

(d)If Buyer and Parent are unable to resolve such disagreements within such
thirty (30) day period (or such longer period as the Parties shall have agreed
in writing), then Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited (or such other independent
accounting firm of recognized international standing as may be mutually
selected by Buyer and Parent) (the "Independent Firm") shall be appointed, as
an expert and not an arbitrator, to resolve any items that remain in dispute
at the end of such period (the "Unresolved Items"), but in no case shall the
Independent Firm review or propose any resolution for any matters that have
not been raised in the Notice of Objection. If Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu
Limited is unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity and the Parties are
not able to mutually select an alternative accounting firm that is willing and
able to serve in such capacity, then Parent shall within ten (10) days deliver
to Buyer a listing of three (3) other accounting firms of internationally
recognized standing (and none of which have worked in the past three (3) years
for Parent or Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates) and Buyer shall
within ten (10) days after receipt of such list, select one of such three (3)
accounting firms to act as the Independent Firm.

 

(e)Buyer and Parent shall instruct the Independent Firm to determine as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within ninety (90) days after the
date on which such dispute is referred to the Independent Firm, based solely
on the provisions of this Agreement, and the written presentations by Parent
and Buyer, and not on an independent review, whether and to what extent (if
any) the calculations set forth in the Final Closing Statement require
adjustment. In resolving any Unresolved Item, the Independent Firm may not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either Party. Parent and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with, and provide
information and documentation, including any accountants' work papers, to
assist the Independent Firm. Any such information and documentation provided
by Parent or Buyer to the Independent Firm shall concurrently be provided to
the other party to the extent not already so provided. None of the Parties
shall disclose to the Independent Firm, and the Independent Firm shall not
consider for any purpose, any settlement discussions or settlement offer made
by any of the Parties with respect to any objection under this Section 2.06,
unless otherwise agreed by Parent and Buyer within thirty (30) days of the
referral to the Independent Firm. Parent and Buyer shall give to the
Independent Firm and each other copies of any written submissions, exhibits
and affidavits in support of their positions within fifteen (15) days after
referral to the Independent Firm; thereafter, Parent and Buyer may submit
written replies to the Independent Firm and each other within fifteen (15)
days. Buyer shall bear and pay a percentage of the fees and expenses of the
Independent Firm that is equal to the percentage of the total dollar amount of

   

changes to the Final Cash Purchase Price proposed by Parent that are
successful, and Parent shall bear and pay a percentage of the fees and
expenses of the Independent Firm that is equal to the percentage of the total
dollar amount of changes to the Final Cash Purchase Price proposed by Parent
that are not successful, in each case, as determined by the Independent Firm.
The determination of the Independent Firm shall be set forth in a written
statement delivered to the Parties and shall be final, conclusive and binding
on the Parties, absent fraud or manifest error.

 

(f)If the Final Closing Statement (as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.06) shows that an amount is due to Buyer (because the Preliminary
Cash Purchase Price is greater than the Final Cash Purchase Price shown on the
Final Closing Statement), the Sellers shall cause to be paid the amount of
such difference to Buyer, in cash. If the Final Closing Statement (as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.06) shows that an amount is due to the
Sellers (because the Preliminary Cash Purchase Price is less than the Final
Cash Purchase Price shown on the Final Closing Statement), Buyer shall
promptly pay such excess to the Sellers, in cash. Any payment pursuant to this
Section 2.06(f) shall be made by Buyer or the Sellers, as the case may be, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days
after the date on which the amount of such payment is finally determined
pursuant to this Section 2.06 to such account or accounts of such other Party
as may be designated by such other Party in writing. In the event of a failure
to timely make such payment, interest shall accrue on such amount for the
period commencing on the payment due date through the date on which such
payment is made calculated at the Prime Rate. Such interest shall be payable
at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated
daily on the basis of a year of three hundred and sixty-five (365) days and
the actual number of days elapsed.

 

(g)The parties agree that any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.06 or
Section 2.07 shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

Section 2.07. Escrow Account.

 

(a)On the Closing Date, Buyer shall deposit Thirty Thousand (30,000) shares of
the Transaction Preferred Stock to be issued to Parent pursuant to Section
2.02(b) into an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") with JP Morgan Chase
Bank N.A. (the "Escrow Agent"), to be held and disbursed pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement; provided that if the Subscription Rights Offering generates
net proceeds greater or equal to the product of (i) One Hundred Twenty Five
Million Dollars ($125,000,000) less the net proceeds received by Holdings
pursuant to the Common Stock Offering, multiplied by (ii) ninety percent
(90%), then on the Closing Date Buyer shall deposit Twenty Five Thousand
(25,000) shares of the Transaction Preferred Stock to be issued to Parent
pursuant to Section 2.02(b) and an amount in cash equal to Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000) into the Escrow Account (the aggregate amount of
Transaction Preferred Stock and/or cash, as applicable, deposited into the
Escrow Account pursuant to this Section 2.07(a), the "Escrow Amount"). The
Escrow Amount shall be used to satisfy indemnification obligations of Parent
and the Sellers as set forth in Section 6.01 and Article IX.

 

(b)Buyer shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Amount, and all interest
and earnings earned from the investment and reinvestment of the Escrow Amount,
or any portion

   

thereof, shall be allocable to Buyer pursuant to Section 468B(g) of the Code.
If and to the extent any amount of the Escrow Amount is actually distributed
to Parent, interest may be imputed on such amount, as required by Section 483
or 1274 of the Code.

 

Section 2.08. Allocation of Purchase Price. (a) Schedule 2.08 sets forth an
allocation of the Purchase Price (together with liabilities treated as assumed
by Buyer for federal income tax purposes and other capitalized costs) among
the Equity Interests and the covenant set forth in Section 5.13, and has been
mutually agreed by Parent and Buyer (the "Allocation Statement"). 

 

(a)Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date or thirty (30) days
following the determination of the Final Net Working Capital (whichever is
later), Buyer shall deliver to Parent (i) an allocation of the amount
allocated in the Allocation Statement to the capital stock of Aleris
Recycling, Inc. among the assets of the Section 338(h)(10) Companies for which
Section 338(h)(10) Elections will be made pursuant to Section 6.04, in
accordance with Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, and, (ii) to the extent the sale of the equity
interests of any other Business Entity is treated for Tax purposes as a sale
of assets, an allocation of the amount allocated in the Allocation Statement
to the equity interests of such Business Entity among the assets of such
Business Entity, in accordance with applicable Law (the "Proposed Asset
Allocation"). Parent will have the right to object to any item in the
Proposed Asset Allocation within thirty (30) days of the delivery of the
Proposed Asset Allocation. If Parent does not object to the Proposed Asset
Allocation, then the Proposed Asset Allocation will become the final
allocation for purposes of Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code (the "Final Asset
Allocation"). If Parent objects to any item in the Proposed Asset Allocation,
Parent and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to resolve the dispute within
thirty (30) days. If, at the end of such 30-day period, Parent and Buyer are
unable to resolve the dispute, then the dispute shall be referred to the
Independent Firm for resolution. Buyer shall bear and pay a percentage of the
fees and expenses of the Independent Firm that is equal to the percentage of
the total dollar amount of changes to the Proposed Asset Allocation proposed
by Parent that are successful, and Parent shall bear and pay a percentage of
the fees and expenses of the Independent Firm that is equal to the percentage
of the total dollar amount of changes to the Proposed Asset Allocation
proposed by Parent that are not successful, in each case, as determined by the
Independent Firm. The determination of the Independent Firm shall be set
forth in a written statement delivered to the Parties and shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties, absent fraud or manifest error.

 

(c)The Allocation Statement and the Final Asset Allocation (in each case, as
amended) will be binding on Parent and Buyer for all Tax purposes. Parent
and Buyer shall not and shall cause their Affiliates not to take any position
on any Tax Return, in connection with any Action relating to Taxes, or
otherwise, that is inconsistent with the Allocation Statement or the Final
Asset Allocation, unless otherwise required by a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. The parties shall cooperate in good
faith to amend the Allocation Statement and/or the Final Asset Allocation to
account for any subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price.

(b)Each of Parent, each Seller and each Business Entity is duly qualified to
do business and is in good standing (where such concept is applicable) in each
jurisdiction where the nature of their respective business or the ownership of
their respective assets makes such qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified (i) in the case of Parent and the Sellers, would
not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to interfere
with, prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent and the Sellers to
enter into and perform their obligations under this Agreement or consummate
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, and (ii) otherwise
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made available to Buyer true and complete

each of Parent and each Seller has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by Parent and such Seller, and no additional corporate or equivalent
proceedings on the part of Parent, Seller or their respective shareholders and
Affiliates are necessary or appropriate to approve or authorize, as

that this Agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed and
delivered by each of Buyer, German Buyer and Holdings, constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of Parent and such Seller, enforceable against Parent and
such Seller in accordance with its terms, except as limited by Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, by general equitable
principles or by the discretion of

   

any Governmental Authority before which any Action seeking enforcement may be
brought (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or
in equity).

 

Section 3.03. Non-contravention. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.03, the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to be executed by Parent or the applicable Seller, the

respect of, or consent from or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other
than (a) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and any
other Competition Laws, (b) compliance with the regulatory requirements set
forth in Schedule 3.04, and (c) any such action or filing the failure of which
to be made or obtained (i) would not reasonably be expected, individually or
in the aggregate, to interfere with, prevent or materially delay the ability
of Parent and the Sellers to enter into and perform their obligations under
this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents, and (ii) otherwise would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. 

 

Section 3.05. Capitalization.

 

(a)All of the Equity Interests are owned beneficially and of record by the
Sellers, free and clear of any Liens other than transfer restrictions imposed
thereon by Law. The Sellers have the full and unrestricted power to sell,

subject to the conditions of this Agreement, free and clear of all Liens other
than transfer restrictions imposed thereon by Law. All of the Equity

for or acquire, capital stock or any other security of that Business Entity,
and no such securities or obligations evidencing such rights are outstanding.
None of the Equity Interests have been issued in violation of, or are subject

subscribe for or purchase any capital stock, limited liability company
interest or partnership interest of any Business Entity, (ii) shares of

may vote.

 

(b)Schedule 3.05(b) sets forth an accurate and complete list of (i) each
Business Entity, (ii) the authorized shares of capital stock of, partnership
interests that represent the corporate capital of, or other equity interests
of each such Business Entity, (iii) the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of, partnership interests that represent the corporate capital
of, or other equity interests of each such Business Entity, and (iv) the legal
ownership of each such Business Entity. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.05(b), all of the Transferred Subsidiaries are owned beneficially, directly
or indirectly, and of record by the Transferred Entities, free and clear of
any Liens other than Permitted Liens and transfer restrictions imposed thereon
by Law. The Sellers have the full and unrestricted power to sell, assign,
transfer and deliver the Transferred Entities to Buyer upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, free and clear of all Liens other
than transfer restrictions imposed thereon by Law, and no Person has a right
of first offer, right of first refusal or similar right with respect to the
Transferred Entities or Transferred Subsidiaries that would be triggered by
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except for the Transferred
Subsidiaries, the Transferred Entities and the Transferred Subsidiaries do not
own or hold any equity interest in any other Person. There is no (A) existing
option, warrant, call, right or agreement to which any of the Transferred
Entities or Transferred Subsidiaries is a party requiring, and there are no
securities of any of the Transferred Subsidiaries outstanding that upon
conversion or exchange would require, an increase to the value of any capital
stock, limited liability company interest or partnership interest of any
Transferred Subsidiary, as applicable, or other securities convertible into,
exchange for or evidencing the right to subscribe for or purchase any capital
stock, limited liability company interest or partnership interest of any

Section 3.06. Financial Statements. Parent has made available to Buyer
complete and correct copies of the (i) audited combined and consolidated
balance sheets of the Business as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the
related combined and consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive
income, cash flows and changes in equity for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2013 (the "Audited Financial Statements"), and (ii)
the unaudited combined statements of financial position of the Business for
the six-month period ended as of June 30, 2014, and the related unaudited
combined statements of income, comprehensive income, group equity, and cash
flows for the six-month period ended as of June 30, 2014 (the "Unaudited
Financial Statements"; and together with the Audited Financial

   

Statements, the "Financial Statements"), true and complete copies of which are
set forth in Schedule 3.06. The Financial Statements (A) have been prepared
from, are in accordance with, and accurately reflect the books and records of
Parent in all material respects (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto), (B) fairly present in all material respects the combined financial
position and combined results of operations and cash flows of the Business as

and (C) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of the
Unaudited Financial Statements, for normal and recurring year-end
adjustments). This Section 3.06 is qualified by the fact that the Business has
not operated as a separate "stand alone" entity within Parent. As a result,
the Business has been allocated certain charges and credits for purposes of
the preparation of the Financial Statements, as described in Schedule 3.06.
Such allocations of charges and credits do not necessarily reflect the amounts
that would have resulted from arms-length transactions or the actual costs
that would be incurred if the Business operated as an independent enterprise. 

 

Section 3.07. Absence of Certain Developments. (a) Since December 31, 2013
through the date of this Agreement, there has not been any Effect which has

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as reflected on the Unaudited
Financial Statements, from the Balance Sheet Date through the date of this
Agreement, the Business has been conducted in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice in all material respects, and (c) from the Balance Sheet
Date through the date of this Agreement, no Business Entity has taken any
action that would, if taken by such Business Entity from the date hereof
through the Closing Date, require the consent of Buyer under clauses (b), (c),
(e), (f), (m) or (r) of Section 5.01.

effect, and there are no Actions pending or, to the Sellers' knowledge,
threatened by any Governmental Authority that seek the revocation,
cancellation, suspension or adverse modification thereof. None of the
Business Entities are in default, and, to the knowledge of the Sellers, no
condition exists that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a
default, under the Permits.

 

(c)Each of the Business Entities and, to the knowledge of the Sellers, each of
their respective current agents and representatives (in their capacity as such

Business Entities has been in the last two years, and is not now, under any

(a)Except as set forth on Schedule 3.09(a), there are no material Actions
pending by or before any Governmental Authority or, to the knowledge of the
Sellers, threatened against Parent, the Sellers or the Business Entities, nor,
to the knowledge of the Sellers, is there any material investigation pending,
against Parent, the Sellers of the Business Entities, other than in the case

Parent and the Sellers of the transactions contemplated hereby or that would
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in
material Liability to the Business Entities, taken as a whole, or otherwise

indemnification or advancement of expenses by any Person (including any
employee), whether or not covered by insurance or reserved for on the

threatened against any Seller, Parent or their respective Affiliates (to the
extent related to the Business) or any of the Business Entities.

 

Section 3.10. No Undisclosed Liabilities. The Business Entities do not have
any Liabilities that would have been required to be reflected in, reserved
against or otherwise described in the Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP,

which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so
qualified and has been so qualified from its adoption to date, and each trust

Code. Each such Transferred Entity Plan and Parent Plan has received a
favorable determination letter, or has pending or is within the remedial
amendment period in which to file, an application for such determination from
the IRS. Sellers have furnished to the Buyer copies of the most recent
Internal Revenue Service determination or opinion letters with respect to each
such plan, and no action or event has occurred since the date of the most
recent determination or opinion letter relating to any such Transferred Entity
Plan or Parent Plan that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
tax-qualified status of any such plan or related trust.

   

(f)Each Transferred Entity Plan has been maintained in material compliance
with its terms and with any applicable Law. None of the Transferred Entity
Plans are, to the knowledge of Sellers, presently under audit or examination

Governmental Authorities) have been timely submitted.

 

(g)With respect to each Transferred Entity Plan that covers Non-U.S. Business
Employees, to the knowledge of Sellers: (i) no Taxes, penalties or fees are
owing or assessable under or against any such Transferred Entity Plan, (ii) no
event has occurred with respect to any such Transferred Entity Plan which is
tax-qualified or registered under Law which would result in the revocation or
loss of such tax-qualified status or registration of such Transferred Entity
Plan, or which would entitle any Person (without the consent of the sponsor of
such Transferred Entity Plan) to wind up or terminate any such Transferred
Entity Plan, in whole or in part, and (iii) each Business Entity has met all
minimum funding obligations required by applicable Law.

 

(h)Any Transferred Entity Plan or Parent Plan that is a "non-qualified
deferred compensation plan," as such term is defined under Code Section

and has met the requirements of Code Sections 409A(a)(2), (3) and (4), (ii) is
and has been operated in all material respects in accordance with the
transitional relief and all guidance and regulations provided by the IRS under

(i)Any Transferred Entity Plan may be amended or terminated at any time
without Liability to any Business Entity and subject to applicable Law and to
the Business Entities' statutory and contractual obligations to pay any earned
and vested benefits thereunder. Any investment vehicles used to fund any
Transferred Entity Plan may be changed at any time upon reasonable advance
notice without incurring a material sales charge, surrender fee or other
similar expense that would be payable in whole or in part by any Business
Entity.

 

(j)Subject to Schedule 3.13(j), all contributions required to be made with
respect to any Transferred Entity Plan by applicable Law or any Transferred
Entity Plan document, and all premiums due or payable with respect to any

full, or to the extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date
hereof under applicable Law or the Transferred Entity Plan document, have been
accrued in accordance with normal accounting practices and are fully reflected
on the Financial Statements. Except as disclosed in writing to the Buyers
prior to the date hereof, there has been no amendment to, written
interpretation of or announcement relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, any Transferred Entity Plan that would
increase materially the expense of maintaining such Transferred Entity Plan
above the level of expense incurred in respect thereof for the fiscal year
ended prior to the date hereof.

   

(k)No tax under Section 4980B or 4980D of the Code has been incurred in

employee post-retirement medical or health plans in effect, except as required
by Section 4980B of the Code, or any other post-retirement welfare benefit
programs.

 

(m)Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event, such as a termination of employment) (i) except as set
forth on Schedule 3.13(m)(i), result in any payment (including, without
limitation, severance, parachute or otherwise) becoming due to any Business
Employee under any Transferred Entity Plan or otherwise, (ii) materially
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Transferred Entity Plan, or
(iii) except as set forth on Schedule 3.13(m)(iii), result in the acceleration
of the time of payment or vesting of any material benefits. The transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not cause a "change in ownership" of
Parent within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. No event has occurred,
and there exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with the
Business, that could subject any Transferred Entity Plan to any Liability
under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law.

the Business Entities, including the Transaction Services Agreement,
constitute all of the assets, properties, rights, titles and interests
necessary to operate the Business immediately following the Closing in all
material respects in substantially the manner conducted immediately prior to
the Closing; provided, however, the foregoing is subject to the limitation
that certain transfers, assignments, licenses, sublicenses, leases and
subleases, as the case may be, of Contracts and Permits, all of which are set
forth on the Schedules hereto, and any claim or right or benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom, may require consent of a Person or
Governmental Authority, which has not been obtained, and that such matters are
addressed elsewhere in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. As

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents,
each of the Business Entities will own, possess, license, lease or otherwise
have control of all assets (including pursuant to Contracts) necessary for the

of creditors' rights generally, by general equitable principles or by the
discretion of any Governmental Authority before which any Action seeking
enforcement may be brought (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding at law or in equity). No event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of
Parent under the Parent Backstop.

standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each of Buyer, German Buyer
and Holdings is duly qualified to do business (where such concept is
applicable) in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the
ownership of its assets makes such qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to interfere with, prevent or materially
delay the ability of Buyer, German Buyer or Holdings to enter into and perform
its obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of Buyer, German Buyer and Holdings has the company
power and authority necessary to own or lease its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as presently conducted in all material respects.

all requisite corporate or equivalent organizational powers and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and each other Transaction Document to be
executed by it and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated on its part hereby and thereby. This
Agreement and each Transaction Document to be executed by Buyer, German Buyer
and Holdings has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Buyer, German
Buyer and Holdings, respectively, and, assuming that this Agreement has been
duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Sellers and Parent,
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of each of Buyer, German Buyer and
Holdings enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as
limited by Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, by
general equitable principles or by the discretion of any Governmental
Authority before which any Action seeking enforcement may be brought
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in
equity).

 

Section 4.03. Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
each of Buyer, German Buyer and Holdings of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to be executed by it, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and the fulfillment of and the
performance by it of its obligations hereunder and thereunder do not and will
not (a) violate any provision of its Organizational Documents, (b) violate or
result in a breach of, or constitute a default or require a consent under or
give rise to any right of termination or other action by any Person under, any
provision of any Contract to which it is party, (c) assuming compliance with

Law of any Governmental Authority applicable to it, or (d) result in the
creation or imposition of any material Lien on any of its asset.

 

Section 4.04. Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by each of Buyer, German Buyer and Holdings of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby require no action by or in
respect of, or consent from or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other
than (a) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and other
Competition Laws, and (b) any such action or filing the failure of which to be
made or obtained would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to interfere

   

with, prevent or materially delay the ability of it to enter into and perform
its obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

 

Section 4.05. Litigation. As of the date hereof, there are no Actions
pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened against Buyer, German Buyer
or Holdings by or before any Governmental Authority, nor, to the knowledge of
Buyer, is there any material investigation pending against Buyer, German Buyer
or Holdings, except for such Actions as would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to interfere with, prevent or materially
delay the ability of Buyer, German Buyer or Holdings to enter into and perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
There is no order, writ, judgment, award, ruling injunction, decree or consent
decree entered by or with any Governmental Authority purporting to enjoin or
restrain the execution, delivery and performance by Buyer, German Buyer or
Holdings of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or that would reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to interfere with, prevent or materially
delay the ability of Buyer, German Buyer or Holdings to enter into and perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

Section 4.06. Financing. Buyer has delivered to Parent a true and complete
copy of the executed Debt Commitment Letters. None of the Debt Commitment
Letters has been amended or modified in any manner prior to the date of this
Agreement. Neither Buyer nor any of Affiliates has entered into any
agreement, side letter or other arrangement relating to the financing of the
Closing Date Payments or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters. The proceeds of the
Debt Financing (both before and after giving effect to the exercise of any or
all "market flex" provisions related thereto), along with cash of the Buyer,
will be sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the making of all Closing Date Payments on the Closing Date and the
making of any payments pursuant to Section 2.06. As of the date hereof, the
respective commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letters have not been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, the Debt
Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and represent a valid, binding
and enforceable obligation of Buyer and, to the knowledge of Buyer, each other
party thereto, to provide the financing contemplated thereby subject only to
the satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions and except as limited
by Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, by general
equitable principles or by the discretion of any Governmental Authority before
which any Action seeking enforcement may be brought (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). Buyer has fully
paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other amounts that
are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection
with the Debt Financing. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or
default on the part of Buyer or, to the knowledge of Buyer, any other party
thereto, under any of the Debt Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof,
Buyer has no reason to believe that it or any other party thereto will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term of the Debt Commitment Letters.
There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than the Financing
Conditions. Buyer understands and acknowledges that under the terms of this
Agreement, Buyer's obligation to consummate the acquisition is not in any way
contingent upon

   

or otherwise subject to Buyer's consummation of any financing arrangements,
Buyer's obtaining of any financing or the availability, grant, provision or
extension of any financing to Buyer.

 

Section 4.07. Solvency. Neither Buyer nor German Buyer is entering into this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby with the actual intent to
hinder, delay or defraud present or future creditors of Buyer, German Buyer or
any of their respective Affiliates. After giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, at and immediately after the Closing, Buyer,
German Buyer and each of their respective Subsidiaries (including each of the
Business Entities) (a) will be solvent (in that both the fair value of its
assets will not be less than the sum of its indebtedness (including a
reasonable estimate of any contingent Liabilities) and that the present fair

its probable Liability on its recourse indebtedness as such indebtedness
matures or becomes due), (b) will have adequate capital and liquidity with
which to engage in its business, and (c) will not have incurred and does not
plan to incur indebtedness beyond its ability to pay as such indebtedness

adviser's or similar fee from Buyer, German Buyer, Holdings or any Person
acting on its behalf in connection with this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.09. Purchase for Investment. Each of Buyer and German Buyer is
purchasing the Equity Interests for investment for its own account and not
with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof.
Each of Buyer and German Buyer (either alone or together with its advisors)
has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so
as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the
Equity Interests and is capable of bearing the economic risks of such
investment. Each of Buyer and German Buyer acknowledges that the Equity
Interests have not been registered under any federal, state or foreign
securities Laws and that the Equity Interests may not be sold, transferred,
offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of unless such
transfer, sale, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition is
registered under any federal, state or foreign securities Laws or is effected
pursuant to an exemption from registration under any federal, state or foreign
securities Laws.

express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information
regarding the Business or the Business Entities, in each case except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 4.11. No Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter. Neither Buyer, German
Buyer nor Holdings has any plan or intention to take any action with respect
to the Business Entities subsequent to the Closing that would cause the

Shelter" described in Internal Revenue Service Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.

not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Parent, the
Sellers and the Business Entities.

 

(b)Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Buyer shall not have access to (A)
personnel records of the Business Employees including records relating to
individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories, individual
employee benefit information or other information which in Parent's opinion is
sensitive or the disclosure of which is not consistent with applicable data
protection laws, (B) any properties of Parent, the Sellers, the Business
Entities or any of their respective Affiliates for purposes of conducting any
intrusive environmental sampling or testing, or (C) any information to the
extent relating to the Retained Businesses, (ii) Parent, the Sellers and the
Business Entities and their respective Affiliates may withhold (A) any
information relating to the sale process, bids received from other Persons in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
information and analysis (including financial analysis) relating to such bids,
and (B) any document or information, the disclosure of which could reasonably
be expected to violate any Contract or any Law, result in the loss of
protectable interests in trade secrets, or result in the waiver of any legal
privilege or work-product privilege (provided, that, in the case of this
clause (B), Parent shall give notice to Buyer of the fact that such documents
or information are being withheld and thereafter Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such documents or information, as
applicable, to be made available in a manner that would not reasonably be
expected to cause such a violation, disclosure or waiver) and (iii) Buyer's
access to the Tax information, books and records of Parent and its Affiliates
(including the Business Entities) shall be governed exclusively by Article VI.

 

(c)Parent, the Sellers and the Business Entities shall have the right to have
one or more Representatives present at all times during any such inspections,
interviews and examinations. Buyer shall hold in confidence all such
information disclosed, whether before or after the date hereof, pursuant to
the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and such information shall not be used by any Person, other than in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or as otherwise expressly
permitted by the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, prior to the Closing, without the prior written
consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, Buyer shall not contact any Business Employees or any vendors to,
or customers of, Parent, the Sellers, the Business Entities or any of their
respective Affiliates regarding the Business, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. In no event shall Buyer contact any vendors
to, or customers of, Parent and the Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates about the Retained Businesses.

 

Section 5.03. Regulatory Filings.

 

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable under applicable
Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
(i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any Governmental
Authority all documentation necessary to effect all filings, notices,
petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications
and other documents and (ii) obtaining and maintaining all approvals,
consents, registrations, permits, authorizations, waivers

   

and other confirmations, in each case, required to be made with or obtained
from any Governmental Authority that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the
"Regulatory Approvals"); provided that neither Parent, the Sellers nor their
respective Affiliates shall have any obligation to make payments to any third
party in connection with obtaining any Regulatory Approvals. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party and their respective
Affiliates shall not extend any waiting period or comparable period under the
HSR Act or any other Competition Law or enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Authority not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
except with the prior written consent of the other Party hereto (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(b)In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, (i) make or cause to be made
all filings required of such Party or any of its Affiliates under the HSR Act
and the other Competition Laws of the jurisdictions set forth in Schedule
5.03(b) with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable and, in any event, within ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof, (ii) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request under
the HSR Act and any other Competition Law for additional information,
documents or other materials received by any such Party or any of its
Affiliates from any Governmental Authority in respect of such filings or such
transactions (each, a "Second Request") and (iii) cooperate with the other
Parties in connection with any such filing and in connection with resolving
any investigation or other inquiry of any Governmental Authority under the HSR
Act or any other Competition Laws with respect to any such filing or any such
transaction. Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to
the other Parties all information required for any application or other filing
to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including, to the extent permitted by Law,
responding to any reasonable requests for copies of documents filed with the
non-filing Party's prior filings). Any Party may, as it deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other Parties under this Section 5.03 as "outside counsel only." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside legal counsel of the recipient, and the recipient shall cause such
outside counsel not to disclose such materials or information to any
Representatives of the recipient or their Affiliates, unless express written
permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials. Each
Party shall promptly inform the other Parties of any oral communication with,
and provide copies of written communications with, any Governmental Authority
regarding any such filings or any such transaction and shall discuss with and
permit the other Parties to review in advance any proposed written
communications to any such Governmental Authority. No Party shall
independently participate in any formal meeting with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other inquiry
without giving the other Party prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or
participate. Subject to applicable Law, the Parties will consult and
cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any Party relating to proceedings under the HSR
Act or any other Competition Laws. Parent and Buyer shall each pay 50% of all
filing fees in connection with all filings under the HSR Act and other
applicable Competition Laws.

   

(c)In furtherance and not in limitation of the actions and obligations
described in Section 5.03(b), Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under the HSR Act and other applicable Competition Laws. In connection
therewith, if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as in violation of
the HSR Act or any other Competition Law, Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such Action, and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, limits or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including by pursuing all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal, unless, by mutual agreement, the Parties
decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests. Buyer shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to
cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act and other
applicable Competition Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as
possible after the execution of this Agreement. 

 

(d)Buyer further agrees that it shall, to the extent necessary to obtain the
Regulatory Approvals required to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section
8.01(a) or Section 8.01(b), as applicable, or to avoid the entry of or have
lifted, vacated or terminated any Closing Legal Impediment, take the following
actions: (i) propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer
is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, and in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, the sale,
divestiture or disposition (including by licensing any Intellectual Property)
of any assets of the Business and/or any other assets or businesses of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (or equity interests held by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates in entities with assets or businesses); (ii) terminate any existing
relationships and contractual rights and obligations; (iii) otherwise offer to
take or offer to commit to take any action which it is capable of taking and,
if the offer is accepted, take or commit to take such action, that limits its
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the assets
of the Business and/or any other assets or businesses of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (or equity interests held by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in
entities with assets or businesses); and (iv) take promptly, in the event that
any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any Action that would make
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents unlawful or that would prevent or materially delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, any and all steps (including the appeal thereof, the
posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii) of this Section 5.03(d)) necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such
injunction or order. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer's obligations under
this Section 5.03 shall be absolute and not qualified by "reasonable best
efforts." For the further avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that Parent's
and Sellers' obligations under this Section 5.03 shall not include any
obligation on the part of Parent, the Sellers or their respective Affiliates
to commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust or
otherwise the sale or disposition of such of its assets or businesses
(including the Business) as may be required to be divested in order to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any decree, order, judgment,
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
preceding, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing,

   

materially delaying or limiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.04. Post-Closing Financial Statements. Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Parent pursuant to Parent's
established closing cycle and reporting deadlines, the normal quarter and
month-end financial information of the type that the Business provided to
Parent via its financial reporting system for past reporting periods, covering
the period ending as of the Closing Date.

 

Section 5.05. Shared Contracts; Affiliate Transactions.

 

(a)The Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
cooperate and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Shared Contracts set forth in Schedule 5.05(a) (the "Buyer Designated Shared
Contracts") to be replaced with separate contracts (the "Buyer Replacement
Contracts") intended to provide Buyer or any Business Entity with contract
rights and obligations that are substantially similar in the aggregate (taking
into account changes in volume and similar pricing metrics, as well as the
needs of Buyer and the Business Entities) to those contract rights and
obligations utilized by Parent or its Subsidiaries under the Buyer Designated
Shared Contracts in the conduct of the Business prior to the Closing. The
Parties shall cooperate and provide each other with reasonable assistance in
effecting such separation of the Buyer Designated Shared Contracts prior to
the Closing and for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days following the
Closing. If the Parties are not able to effect the separation of a Buyer
Designated Shared Contract prior to the Closing, then, until the date that is
one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing or the earlier date on
which such Buyer Designated Shared Contract is separated, to the extent
permissible under Law and under the terms of such Buyer Designated Shared
Contract, (i) at the sole cost and expense of Buyer, Parent or the applicable
Non-Business Subsidiary shall continue to perform the obligations under such
Buyer Designated Shared Contract relating to the Business, (ii) Parent or the
applicable Non-Business Subsidiary shall hold in trust for the benefit of
Buyer, and shall promptly forward to Buyer, any monies or other benefits
received pursuant to such Buyer Designated Shared Contract relating to the
Business and (iii) the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
institute alternative arrangements intended to put the Parties in a
substantially similar economic position as if such Buyer Designated Shared
Contract was separated. Subject to the second sentence of this Section
5.05(a), Buyer shall be solely responsible for replacing any Buyer Designated
Shared Contracts to the extent such Shared Contracts are not separated or
transitioned hereunder. With respect to Liabilities pursuant to, under or
relating to a given Buyer Designated Shared Contract, such Liabilities shall,
unless otherwise allocated pursuant to this Agreement or a Buyer Replacement
Contract, be allocated from time to time between Parent and the Non-Business
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Buyer and the Business Entities, on the
other hand, as the case may be, based on the relative proportions of total
benefits received (to the extent the Liabilities relate to a specific period,
over such period, and otherwise over the term of the applicable Buyer
Designated Shared Contract, measured up to the date of the allocation, without
duplication) by Parent and the Non-Business Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or
Buyer and the Business Entities, on the other hand, under the relevant Buyer
Designated Shared Contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party shall
be solely responsible for any and all Liabilities to the extent arising out of
or relating to such Party's (or its Subsidiaries') breach of any such Buyer
Designated Share Contract.

   

(b)Except (i) as contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, including the Transition Services Agreement, (ii) for Trade
Intercompany Arrangements (each of which shall continue in effect in
accordance with its terms listed on Schedule 5.05(b)), (iii) for this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or (iv) as otherwise set forth
in Schedule 5.05(b), Buyer acknowledges and agrees that all Affiliate
Transactions, and all rights and obligations of the Business or the Business
Entities under Contracts with respect thereto, will be terminated at or prior
to the Closing, with no further Liability of Parent or the Non-Business
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Buyer or the Business Entities, on the other
hand, with respect thereto.

 

(c)Except as set forth in Schedule 5.05(c), Parent shall cause all
Intercompany Balances with respect to the Business to be eliminated by
discharge or otherwise in their entirety effective on or prior to the Closing.

 

(d)The Parties agree that the PLPA shall continue in effect between Aleris
Deutschland and Aleris Germany until and including the last financial year of
Aleris Germany ending prior to the Closing Date so that the German Tax Group
remains fully effective until the end of the last financial year of Aleris
Germany prior to the Closing Date. Therefore, the Parties agree to the
following:

 

(i)Aleris Deutschland shall cause all claims for profit transfer and/or loss
assumption that are outstanding under the PLPA on the basis of audited annual
financial statements of Aleris Germany to be paid or otherwise settled prior
to the Closing Date.

 

(ii)Prior to the Closing Date, Aleris Deutschland and Aleris Germany shall
agree upon an estimation of the annual profit or annual loss of Aleris Germany
before the operation of the PLPA for all financial years in relation to which
audited financial statements are not available by the Closing Date, and shall
pay an advance profit transfer or advance loss assumption (as applicable).

 

(iii)Buyer shall provide copies of audited financial statements of Aleris
Germany that are finalized or changed after the Closing Date to Aleris
Deutschland without undue delay after receipt thereof. Within 20 Business
Days following receipt by Aleris Germany of such audited financial statements
from the relevant auditing firm, Buyer shall execute, or cause to be executed,
a shareholder resolution of Aleris Germany adopting such audited financial
statements.

 

(iv)If Aleris Germany is required under the terms of the PLPA at any time on
or after the Closing Date to pay to Aleris Deutschland any amounts of profit
transfer (Gewinnabfuhrung) in relation to any financial years ending before
the Closing Date, (i) Aleris Germany shall duly pay such amounts to a bank
account designated by Aleris Deutschland and (ii) Parent shall pay an amount
equal to such sum to Buyer. Such payment by Parent pursuant to clause (ii)
shall be treated to the extent legally permissible as an adjustment to the
Final Cash Purchase Price allocated to Aleris Germany.

 

(v)If Aleris Deutschland is obliged under the terms of the PLPA at any time on
or after the Closing Date to pay to Aleris Germany any amounts of loss
assumption

   

(Verlustubernahme) in relation to any financial years ending before the
Closing Date, (i) Aleris Deutschland shall duly pay such amounts to a bank
account designated by Aleris Germany and (ii) Buyer shall pay an amount equal
to such sum to Parent. Such payment by Buyer pursuant to clause (ii) shall be
treated to the extent legally permissible as an adjustment to the Final Cash
Purchase Price allocated to Aleris Germany.

 

Section 5.06. Third Party Approvals and Permits.

 

(a)Except with respect to Regulatory Approvals which are addressed in Section
5.03, and the Shared Contracts which are addressed in Section 5.05, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, prior to the Closing, each Party
shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) obtain the consents, waivers, approvals, orders and
authorizations (the "Third Party Approvals") necessary to transfer and assign
the rights under Contracts that require any such consent, waiver, approval,
order or authorization (each, a "Non-Assignable Contract"), and (ii) provide
all notices and otherwise take all actions (the "Permit Actions") necessary to
transfer, reissue or obtain any Permits required to be transferred, reissued
or obtained as a result of or in furtherance of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (each, a "Transferred Permit"). In connection with the
foregoing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold Parent, the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates (other than the Business Entities) harmless from and
against any and all Liabilities based upon, arising out of or relating to the
performance of, or failure to perform, in each case, following the Closing,
any obligations under the Non-Assignable Contracts or Transferred Permits. To
the extent that any Third Party Approval or Permit Action has not been
obtained or taken, as applicable, prior to Closing, for up to one hundred
eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, each Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, at the other Party's request, to endeavor to
obtain such Third Party Approval or take such Permit Action. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither Party shall be required to incur any Liabilities to the
third parties that are party to the Non-Assignable Contracts or provide any
financial accommodation, in order to obtain any such Third Party Approval or
take such Permit Action with respect to the transfer or assignment of any such
Non-Assignable Contract or the issuance of any such Transferred Permit.

 

(b)To the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of such Non-
Assignable Contract or Transferred Permit, in the event any Third Party
Approval or Permit Action has not been obtained or taken, as applicable, by
Closing, at the request of the Party to whom such Non-Assignable Contract is
contemplated to be transferred or by whom such Transferred Permit is
contemplated to be obtained (the "Receiving Party"), the Party contemplated to
be transferring such Non-Assignable Contract or Transferred Permit under this
Agreement (the "Transferring Party") shall hold in trust for the Receiving
Party, as applicable, the relevant Non-Assignable Contract or Transferred
Permit until such time as the Third Party Approval or Permit Action is
obtained or taken, as applicable, but in no event longer than one hundred
eighty (180) days after the Closing Date. During such time period, the
Transferring Party shall comply with all applicable covenants and obligations
under the Non-Assignable Contract or Transferred Permit, including the payment
of any costs or expenses in connection therewith, which shall be performed by
the Transferring Party for the Receiving Party's account and the Receiving
Party shall promptly (but in no event later than thirty (30) days following
receipt of an invoice from the Transferring Party) reimburse the Transferring
Party for any reasonably documented out-of-pocket costs, expenses or payments
made by the Transferring Party in respect of such Non-

   

Assignable Contract or Transferred Permit. For the period not to exceed one
hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and the terms of the Non-Assignable Contract or Transferred
Permit, the Receiving Party shall be entitled to receive all of the benefits
of the Transferring Party under the Non-Assignable Contract or Transferred
Permit. The Receiving Party agrees to indemnify and hold the Transferring
Party and its Subsidiaries, agents, successors and assigns harmless from and
against any and all Liabilities based upon, arising out of or relating to the
performance of, or failure to perform, any obligations under the Non-
Assignable Contract or Transferred Permit that are for the benefit of the
Receiving Party, other than actions taken in bad faith by the Transferring
Party or its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the
Closing Date, a Transferring Party shall have no obligation to renew any Non-
Assignable Contract or Transferred Permit upon the expiration or termination
thereof. In addition, to the extent that any Non-Assignable Contract contains
an "evergreen" provision that automatically renews such Non-Assignable
Contract unless terminated or cancelled by either party thereto, a
Transferring Party shall not be prohibited from terminating or canceling such
Non-Assignable Contract as permitted pursuant to the terms thereof.

 

Section 5.07. Business Guarantees. 

 

(a)Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the
respective beneficiary, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, on or before the Closing, valid and binding written releases of Parent
and its Non-Business Subsidiaries, as applicable, from any Liability, whether
arising before, on or after the Closing Date, under any Business Guarantees in
effect as of the Closing, which shall be effective as of the Closing,
including by providing substitute guarantees with terms that are at least as
favorable to the counterparty as the terms of the applicable Business
Guarantees and by furnishing letters of credit, instituting escrow
arrangements, posting surety or performance bonds or making other arrangements
as the counterparty may request. Subject to Section 5.07(b), if any Business
Guarantee has not been released as of the Closing Date, then Buyer shall, for
one hundred eighty (180) days following the closing, use its commercially
reasonable efforts after the Closing to cause each such unreleased Business
Guarantee to be released promptly. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein but subject to Section 5.07(b), the Parties acknowledge and agree that
at any time on or after the Closing Date, Parent and its Subsidiaries may, in
such Person's sole discretion, take any action to terminate, obtain release of
or otherwise limit their Liability under any and all outstanding Business
Guarantees. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its
Subsidiaries from and after the Closing for any Liabilities arising out of or
relating to any Business Guarantees which relate to periods following the
Closing, and such indemnification obligations shall not be subject to any
limitations on liability set forth in Section 9.04.

 

(b)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, including Section 5.07(a),
to the extent any Business Guarantees are required to be provided as a
condition to, pursuant to, or otherwise in connection with a Permit issued to
a Business Entity or otherwise in respect of the Business, Parent shall
maintain all such Business Guarantees until such time as such Permit has been
reissued in the name of Buyer or renewed by a Business Entity following
Closing.

   

Section 5.08. Use of Aleris Marks.

 

(a)Buyer agrees that, except as set forth in this Section 5.08, Buyer has, and
after the Closing, the Business Entities will have, no right, title, interest,
license or any other right whatsoever in the Aleris Marks, and that none of
Parent, the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates have assigned such
right, title, interest, license or other right to Buyer or the Business
Entities.

 

(b)For a period of six (6) months following the Closing Date, Buyer and the
Business Entities shall have the right to continue to use the marketing and
promotional materials, invoices, business cards, schedules, displays, signs,
stationery, technical guidelines, product manuals, packing materials and other
supplies and similar materials, that were previously created and included in
the inventory of the Business and that incorporate the Aleris Marks, solely in
the manner such supplies and materials were used in the Business prior to
Closing; provided, however, that as promptly as practicable after Closing, but
in no event after the conclusion of such six (6) month period, Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Business Entities to, cease and discontinue any use of the
Aleris Marks and, at Buyer's sole cost and expense, remove all Aleris Marks
from all such supplies and materials, in each case, whether such supplies or
materials are held by Buyer or the Business Entities or under the control of
Buyer or the Business Entities.

 

(c)Before the Closing, Parent, the Sellers and their respective Subsidiaries
(including the Business Entities) may execute and file all documents as shall
be necessary or desirable to change the name of the Business Entities to
remove the words "Aleris" or any derivation or translation thereof, from such
names. To the extent not already changed by Parent, the Sellers or their
respective Subsidiaries (including the Business Entities), as promptly as
practicable after the Closing but in no event later than ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Business Entities to,
at Buyer's sole cost and expense, change the names of the Business Entities to
remove the words "Aleris" or any derivation or translation thereof, including
making filings with the applicable Governmental Authority of each jurisdiction
in which the ownership or the operation of the Business Entities' assets or
the character of its activities is such as to require it to be licensed or
qualified in such jurisdiction, and providing notice to all customers, vendors
and other suppliers of such name change.

 

Section 5.09. Insurance. 

 

(a)Buyer acknowledges that all insurance coverage for the Business Entities
and the Business under policies of Parent, the Sellers and their Affiliates
shall terminate as of the Closing and following the Closing no claims may be
brought against any such policy; provided, that with respect to acts,
omissions, events or circumstances relating to the Business Entities or the
Business that occurred or existed prior to the Closing and that are covered by
third party occurrence-based insurance policies under which the Business
Entities or the Business are insured on or prior to Closing, the Business
Entities may make claims under such occurrence-based policies subject to the
terms and conditions of such occurrence-based policies and this Agreement;
provided, further that Buyer and the Business Entities (i) shall notify Parent
in writing of all such covered claims and (ii) except as otherwise provided by
this Agreement, shall exclusively bear, and neither Parent, the Sellers nor
any of their respective Affiliates shall have any obligation to repay or
reimburse Buyer or any Business Entity for, the amount of any

   

deductibles, self-insured retentions or other out of pocket expenses incurred
in connection therewith associated with claims under such occurrence based
policies, and shall be liable for all uninsured or uncollectible amounts of
such claims.

 

(b)Parent and the Sellers shall, and shall cause the directors, officers,
employees and other advisors of Parent, Sellers and the Business Entities to
reasonably cooperate with Buyer to facilitate Buyer's efforts to obtain
insurance coverage for the Business Entities following Closing.

 

Section 5.10. Legal Proceedings; Production of Witnesses; Privileged Matters.

 

(a)Subject to Article IX, following the Closing Date, (i) Buyer shall have
exclusive authority and control over the investigation, prosecution, defense
and appeal of all Actions with respect to all Liabilities of the Business
Entities, and may settle or compromise, or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to any such Action, without the consent of Parent, (ii)
Parent shall have exclusive authority and control over the investigation,
prosecution, defense and appeal of all Actions with respect to all Liabilities
relating to the Retained Businesses, and may settle or compromise, or consent
to the entry of any judgment with respect to any such Action without the
consent of Buyer, and (iii) Parent and Buyer shall jointly share authority and
control and cooperate in good faith with respect to the investigation,
prosecution, defense and appeal of all Actions that relate to both (A)
Liabilities relating to the Retained Business, and (B) Liabilities of the
Business Entities; provided, that if any Party seeks to assert a claim for
indemnification with respect to any Action, the Parties shall comply with the
provisions of Section 9.03 instead of this Section 5.10(a) with respect to
such Action.

 

(b)From and after the Closing, Parent and the Sellers, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other hand, shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to each other, upon
reasonable written request, their (and their Affiliates') respective
Representatives for fact finding, consultation and interviews and as witnesses
to the extent that any such Person may reasonably be required in connection
with any Actions in which the requesting Party may from time to time be
involved relating to the conduct of the Business or the Retained Businesses,
prior to or after the Closing. Access to such Persons shall be granted during
normal business hours at a location and in a manner reasonably calculated to
minimize disruption to such Persons, the Business and the Retained Businesses,
as applicable. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.10 to the contrary,
if any Party seeks to assert a claim for indemnification in connection with
any Action, the Parties shall comply with the provisions of Section 9.03
instead of this Section 5.10(b) with respect to such Action.

 

(c)Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Article VI shall govern
with respect to Tax-related matters to the extent any provision in Article VI
is in conflict with Sections 5.10(a) or 5.10(b). For the avoidance of doubt,
neither Party shall have an obligation to cooperate, make available personnel
or disclose any documents or other information pursuant to Sections 5.10(a) or
5.10(b) or Article VI, if Parent, the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are
adverse parties in any Action and such assistance, testimony, documents or
other information is reasonably pertinent thereto; provided, further, that
this shall not limit in any respect any rights a Party may have with respect

   

to discovery or the production of documents or other information in connection
with any such Action.

 

(d)The Parties agree that their respective rights and obligations to maintain,
preserve, assert or waive any attorney-client and work product privileges
belonging to either Party with respect to the Business and the Retained
Businesses (collectively, "Privileges"), shall be governed by the provisions
of this Section 5.10(d). With respect to matters relating to the Retained
Businesses, and with respect to all Business Records, documents,
communications or other information (collectively, "Information") of Parent,
the Sellers or any of their Affiliates prepared in connection with this
Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, Parent shall have sole authority to determine whether to assert or
waive any Privileges, including the right to assert any Privilege against
Buyer and its Affiliates. Buyer and its Affiliates shall take no action
without the prior written consent of Parent that would reasonably be expected
to result in any waiver of any such Privileges of Parent, the Sellers or any
of their Affiliates. After the Closing, Buyer shall have sole authority to
determine whether to assert or waive any Privileges with respect to matters
relating to the Business (except for Information prepared in connection with
this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby). However, Buyer may not assert any such Privileges of
Buyer related to pre-Closing advice or communications relating to the Business
against Parent, the Sellers and their Affiliates. Parent, the Sellers and
their Affiliates shall take no action after the Closing without the prior
written consent of Buyer that would reasonably be expected to result in any
waiver of any such Privileges of Buyer. The rights and obligations created by
this Section 5.10(d) shall apply to all Information as to which Parent, the
Sellers, their Affiliates or the Business Entities would be entitled to assert
or has asserted a Privilege without regard to the effect, if any, of the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Privileged Information"). Upon receipt
by Parent, the Sellers or their Affiliates, or Buyer and its Affiliates, as
the case may be, of any subpoena, discovery or other request from any Person
that actually or arguably calls for the production or disclosure of Privileged
Information of the other Party or if Parent, the Sellers or their Affiliates
or Buyer or its Affiliates, as the case may be, obtains knowledge that any
current or former employee of Parent, the Sellers or their Affiliates or Buyer
or its Affiliates, has received any subpoena, discovery or other request from
any Person that actually or arguably calls for the production or disclosure of
Privileged Information of one or more of the other Parties, Parent or Buyer
shall promptly notify the other Parties of the existence of the request and
shall provide such other Party a reasonable opportunity to review the
Privileged Information and to assert any rights it may have under this Section
5.10(d) or otherwise to prevent the production or disclosure of Privileged
Information. Parent's and the Sellers' transfer of any Business Records or
other Information to Buyer in accordance with this Agreement and Parent's and
the Sellers' agreement to permit Buyer to obtain Information existing prior to
the Closing are made in reliance on the Parties' respective agreements, as set
forth in this Section 5.10(d), to maintain the confidentiality of such
Information and to take the steps provided herein for the preservation of all
Privileges that may belong to or be asserted by Parent, the Sellers or Buyer,
as the case may be. The access to Business Records and other Information
being granted pursuant to Sections 5.02, 5.10, 5.11, 9.03, 9.04 and Article
VI, the agreement to provide witnesses and individuals pursuant to this
Section 5.10 and the disclosure to Buyer, Parent and the Sellers of Privileged
Information relating to the Business or the Retained Businesses pursuant to
this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall
not be asserted by Parent, the Sellers or Buyer to

   

constitute, or otherwise be deemed, a waiver of any Privilege that has been or
may be asserted under this Section 5.10(d) or otherwise.

 

(e)The Parties agree that it would be impracticable to remove (i) all
Privileged Information relating to the Business from the books and records
(including electronic mails and other electronic files) of the Retained
Business and (ii) all Privileged Information relating to the Retained
Businesses from the books and records (including electronic emails and other
electronic files) of the Business. Accordingly, the Parties each agree that
no Privileges are waived or intended to be waived by allowing such material to
remain in the respective files of the Business or the Retained Businesses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
Law, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the review by Buyer of any
Privileged Information shall not constitute a waiver of any Privilege.

 

Section 5.11. Retention of Business Records and Post-Closing Access.

 

(a)Prior to the Closing Date, the Parties shall develop and implement a plan
that will result in the delivery or transfer, subject to compliance with
applicable Law, of the Business Records to Buyer (or a Person designated by
Buyer) at the Closing in the manner (and in the case of physical Business
Records, at the location(s)) reasonably requested by Buyer to the extent not
located at an office of the Business Entities.

 

(b)After the Closing, Buyer agrees to, or shall cause the Business Entities
to, hold at least one copy of all Business Records relating to the conduct of
the Business or the Business Entities on or before the Closing Date and not to
destroy or dispose of such copy for a period of seven (7) years from the
Closing Date or such longer time as may be required by applicable Law.

 

(c)From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries,
including the Business Entities, to (i) give Parent, the Sellers and their
Representatives reasonable access to the offices, properties and Business
Records of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, including the Business Entities,
relating to the conduct of the Business and the Business Entities on or before
the Closing Date during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice, (ii) furnish to Parent, the Sellers and their Representatives such
financial and operating data and other information relating to the conduct of
the Business and the Business Entities on or before the Closing Date, and
(iii) cause the Representatives of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, including the
Business Entities, to cooperate with Parent, the Sellers and their
Representatives, in each case, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent or
the Sellers in connection with accounting, Tax, legal defense and other
similar needs. From and after the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Non-Business Subsidiaries to, (A) give Buyer and its Representatives
reasonable access to the offices, properties and Business Records of Parent
and the Non-Business Subsidiaries relating to the conduct of the Business on
or before the Closing Date during normal business hours and upon reasonable
prior notice, (B) furnish to Buyer and its Representatives such financial and
operating data and other information relating to the conduct of the Business
on or before the Closing Date, and (C) cause the Representatives of Parent and
the Non-Business Subsidiaries to cooperate with Buyer and its Representatives,
in each case, to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with
accounting, Tax, legal defense and other similar needs. Any such access shall
be granted in a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
the business of the Party granting such access. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, either Party may

   

withhold such access, as and to the extent necessary to avoid contravention or
waiver, as to any document or information the disclosure of which could
reasonably be expected to violate any Contract or any Law or result in the
waiver of any legal privilege or work-product privilege; provided, that to the
extent practicable and in accordance with such Contract or Law, and in a
manner that does not result of the waiver of any such privilege, such Party
shall make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which these restrictions apply; provided, further, that
nothing in this Section 5.11(c) shall limit in any respect any rights any
Party may have with respect to discovery or the production of documents or
other information in connection with any litigation.

 

(d)Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Article VI shall govern
with respect to Tax-related matters to the extent any provision in Article VI
is in conflict with Sections 5.11(a), 5.11(b) or 5.11(c).

 

Section 5.12. Confidentiality.

 

(a)Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect until the Closing and that any books and
records, data and other information provided to Buyer between the date hereof
and the Closing shall be considered Evaluation Material (as such term is
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) and afforded all protections
provided therein. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate.

 

(b)Parent and the Sellers shall not, and shall cause their Representatives and
Subsidiaries and other Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, for a period
of five (5) years after the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of
Buyer, disclose to any third party (other than each other and their respective
Representatives who need to know such information) any confidential or
proprietary information related to the Business; provided, that the foregoing
restriction shall not (i) apply to any information (A) generally available to,
or known by, the public (other than as a result of disclosure in violation of
this Section 5.12(b)) or (B) independently developed by Parent, the Sellers or
any of their Subsidiaries (other than by the Business prior to the Closing)
without reference to or use of the applicable confidential or proprietary
information, or (ii) prohibit any disclosure (A) required by Law so long as,
to the extent legally permissible and feasible, Parent or such Seller, as
applicable, provides Buyer with reasonable prior notice of such disclosure and
a reasonable opportunity to contest such disclosure or (B) made in connection
with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this Agreement or any
of the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section
5.12(b), Parent, the Sellers and their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates and
Representatives shall be deemed to have satisfied their obligations hereunder
with respect to confidential or proprietary information related to the
Business if they exercise the same degree of care (but no less than a
reasonable degree of care) as they take to preserve confidentiality for their
own similar information.

 

(c)Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Representatives, Subsidiaries
(including the Business Entities) and other Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, for a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date, without the
prior written consent of Parent, disclose to any third party (other than each
other and their respective Representatives who need to know such information)

   

any confidential or proprietary information related to the Retained
Businesses; provided, that the foregoing restriction shall not (i) apply to
any information (A) generally available to, or known by, the public (other
than as a result of disclosure in violation of this Section 5.12(c)) or (B)
independently developed by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (other than by the
Retained Businesses prior to the Closing) without reference to or use of the
applicable confidential or proprietary information, or (ii) prohibit any
disclosure (A) required by Law so long as, to the extent legally permissible
and feasible, Buyer provides Parent and the Sellers with reasonable prior
notice of such disclosure and a reasonable opportunity to contest such
disclosure or (B) made in connection with the enforcement of any right or
remedy relating to this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Section 5.12(c), Buyer and its Subsidiaries,
Affiliates and Representatives shall be deemed to have satisfied their
obligations hereunder with respect to confidential or proprietary information
related to the Retained Businesses if they exercise the same degree of care
(but no less than a reasonable degree of care) as they take to preserve
confidentiality for their own similar information.

 

Section 5.13. Noncompetition; Non-Solicitation.

 

(a)During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the five (5)
year anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Restricted Period"), Parent and the
Sellers shall not, and shall cause the Non-Business Subsidiaries not to,
directly or indirectly, engage in any business or activities, or establish any
new businesses, in competition with the Restricted Business as conducted
immediately prior to Closing in the geographic areas in which the Restricted
Business sells products and services immediately prior to Closing including
Europe, North America, China and Turkey (each, a "Competing Activity") or
assist others from engaging in Competing Activity; provided, that the
foregoing shall not prohibit Parent, the Sellers or any of the Non-Business
Subsidiaries from:

 

(i)the acquisition of all or any portion of the equity interests of any Person
engaged in a Competing Activity but only where such Competing Activity
represents less than twenty percent (20%) of the revenues of such person
(based on its latest annual financial statements); provided, that if the
Competing Activity accounts for more than five percent (5%) of the revenues of
such Person (based on its latest annual financial statements), Parent, the
Sellers or any Non-Business Subsidiary, as applicable, shall be required to
use commercially reasonable efforts to cease such Competing Activity or divest
such Person of that portion of the business that constitutes a Competing
Activity within twelve (12) months after the consummation of the acquisition
to the extent required to be in compliance with this Section 5.13(a)(i);

 

(ii)the acquisition, holding of investments or direct or indirect ownership of
any voting stock, capital stock or other equity interest of any Person engaged
in a Competing Activity, so long as such ownership interest represents not
more than five percent (5%) of the aggregate voting power or outstanding
capital stock or other equity interests of such Person; or

 

(iii)owning, engaging in, conducting or operating any of the Retained
Businesses.

   

(b)Each investment or acquisition made by Parent, the Sellers or any Non-
Business Subsidiary that is subject to the provisions of this Section 5.13
must be permissible hereunder at the time of such investment; provided,
however, that any such investment which was permissible when made cannot
thereafter be the basis of a claim of violation of this Section 5.13.

 

(c)For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, Parent and
the Sellers shall not, and shall cause the Non-Business Subsidiaries not to,
directly or indirectly (unless previously authorized in an advance writing
from Buyer):

 

(i)request, induce or attempt to influence any Business Employee to terminate
his or her employment with or service to Buyer or any Business Entity; or

 

(ii)hire or employ, or solicit the employment of, or make or extend any offer
of employment to, any management-level Business Employee who is then employed
by Buyer or the Business Entities. The restrictions of this clause (ii) of
this Section 5.13(c) shall cease to apply to a management-level Business
Employee nine (9) months after the later of (A) the date of termination of his
or her employment with Buyer or any Business Entity and (B) the last date on
which such Business Employee receives severance or other termination payments
from Buyer or any Business Entity. Nothing in clause (ii) of this Section
5.13(c) shall restrict or prevent Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from
making generalized searches for employees by the use of advertisements in the
media of any form (including trade media) or by engaging search firms that are
not instructed to solicit the Business Employees or, in either case, hiring
any Business Employee who responds to such generalized searches or search firm
solicitations.

 

(d)For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
not, and shall cause the Business Entities not to, directly or indirectly
(unless previously authorized in an advance writing from the Parent or the
Sellers, as the case may be):

 

(i)request, induce or attempt to influence any employee of Parent, the Sellers
or any Non-Business Subsidiary to terminate his or her employment with or
service to Parent, the Sellers or any Non-Business Subsidiary; or

 

(ii)hire or employ, or solicit the employment of, or make or extend any offer
of employment to, any management-level employee of Parent, the Sellers or any
Non-Business Subsidiary, or any other employee of Parent, the Sellers or any
Non-Business Subsidiary to whom Buyer is introduced, of whom Buyer has become
aware, or with whom Buyer has otherwise contacted, as a result of the
preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. The restrictions of clause (ii) of this
Section 5.13(d) shall cease to apply to a management-level employee of Parent,
the Sellers or any Non-Business Subsidiary nine (9) months after the later of
(A) the date of termination of his or her employment with the Parent, the
Sellers or any Non-Business Subsidiary and (B) the last date on which such
individual receives severance or other termination payments from Parent, the
Sellers or any Non-Business Subsidiary. Nothing in clause (ii) of this
Section 5.13(d) shall restrict or prevent Buyer or any of the Business
Entities from making generalized searches for employees by the use of
advertisements in the media of any form (including trade media)

   

or by engaging search firms that are not instructed to solicit any employee of
Parent, the Sellers or any Non-Business Subsidiary or, in either case, hiring
any such employee who responds to such generalized searches or search firm
solicitations.

 

(e)The Parties mutually agree this Section 5.13 is reasonable and necessary to
protect and preserve Buyer's and Parent's legitimate business interests and
the value of the Business, the Business Entities and the Retained Businesses,
and to prevent any unfair advantage conferred on any Party and their
respective successors.

 

(f)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, it is understood and
agreed that the remedy of indemnity payments pursuant to Article IX and other
remedies at law would be inadequate in the case of any breach of the covenants
contained in Section 5.13. It is accordingly agreed that Buyer and the
Business Entities, on one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to equitable relief, including an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of Section 5.13 and to enforce specifically the performance
of the terms and provisions of Section 5.13), without proof of actual damages
(and the Parties hereby waive any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which the Parties are entitled at law or in equity. The Parties
further agree not to assert that such a remedy, including a remedy of specific
performance, is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy for any such breach.

 

(g)If (i) a Regulatory Approval in a particular jurisdiction is conditional
upon or otherwise subject to the modification of any provision of this Section
5.13 as provided in the decision of the Governmental Authority in question,
then such provision shall be automatically considered as modified as provided
or required in such decision without the need for any intervention by the
Parties or formal modification of the Agreement by the Parties or (ii) any
Governmental Authority declares that any term or provision of this Section
5.13 is invalid or unenforceable, then, in either case: (a) the Governmental
Authority making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall
have the power to reduce the scope, duration or area of the term or provision,
to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as
so modified after the expiration of the time within which the decision of the
Governmental Authority may be appealed. Any modification under subparagraphs
(i) or (ii) of this Section 5.13(g) shall apply only with respect to the
operation of such provision in the particular jurisdiction in which such
determination is made and shall not be deemed to modify such provision or any
other provision or the enforcement of this Agreement in any other
jurisdiction.

 

Section 5.14. Public Announcements. Prior to the Closing, the timing and
content of all press releases or public announcements regarding any aspect of
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby to the financial community, government agencies
or the general public shall be mutually agreed upon in advance by the Parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may make any such announcement which
it in good faith believes, based on advice of counsel, is required by Law or
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange to which such
Party is subject; provided, that,

   

prior to the Closing, such Party shall consult with and agree on the language
of any such announcement with the other Party prior to any such announcement
to the extent practicable, and shall in any event promptly provide the other
Party with copies of any such announcement.

 

Section 5.15. Financing.

 

(a)Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable to
arrange the Debt Financing as promptly as practicable following the date of
this Agreement and to consummate the Debt Financing on the Closing Date,
including the following:

 

(i)Buyer shall have the right from time to time to amend, replace, supplement
or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Debt Commitment
Letter, and/or substitute other debt (but not equity financing) for all or any
portion of the Debt Financing from the same financing sources or alternative
financing sources (with Parent's consent), if any such amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision of the
Commitment Letter that amends the Debt Financing and/or substitution of all or
any portion of the Debt Financing shall not (i) impose new or additional or
expand upon or modify the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing as set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) prevent or impede or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii)
adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter or (iv) provide for terms and conditions (including any
"flex" provisions) that are, in the aggregate, less favorable to Buyer and the
Sellers than those in the Debt Commitment Letter. Buyer shall not be permitted
to reduce the amount of Debt Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter unless
it provides an equity commitment letter of a corresponding amount.

 

(ii)participation by senior management of Buyer in, and assistance with, the
preparation of rating agency presentations and meetings with rating agencies;

 

(iii)satisfying on a timely basis (or obtain a waiver of) all Financing
Conditions that are within its control;

 

(iv)negotiating, executing and delivering Debt Financing Documents that
reflect the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any
"market flex" provisions related thereto) and providing copies of drafts
thereof exchanged with the Financing Sources to Parent, subject to any
customary redaction;

 

(v)in the event that the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 and
the Financing Conditions have been satisfied or, upon funding would be
satisfied, causing the Financing Sources to fund the full amount of the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing (and, for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that (A) in the event that on the final day of the
Marketing Period (x) all or a portion of the Debt Financing structured as high
yield debt or contemplated to be sold pursuant to a Rule 144A transaction has
not been issued or sold, (y) all conditions precedent to Buyer's obligations
hereunder shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
which by their

   

nature will not be satisfied until the Closing) and (z) the bridge financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter is available, then on such date
Buyer shall borrow under and use the proceeds of the bridge financing to
finance, in part, the Closing Date Payments and (B) Buyer shall comply with
any "securities demand" or similar provisions included in the Debt Commitment
Letter or any related fee letter and use any proceeds from the sale of
securities issued thereunder to finance, in part, the Closing Date Payments);
and

 

(vi)enforcing its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters.

 

(b)Buyer shall keep Parent informed in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. Buyer shall give Parent prompt notice
(a) of any breach or repudiation, or any anticipated or threatened breach or
repudiation (including any event or circumstance that, without or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any breach or repudiation), by any Party to the Debt Commitment Letters of
which Buyer or its Affiliates becomes aware or (b) if, for any reason, Buyer
no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters on
the terms described therein. Without limiting Buyer's other obligations under
this Section 5.15, if a Financing Failure Event occurs, Buyer shall (i)
promptly notify Parent of such Financing Failure Event and the reasons
therefor, (ii) in consultation with the Parent and the Sellers, use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain (on terms as favorable to Buyer in the
aggregate as are reasonably available for financings of the type contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter in the debt markets at such time) alternative
financing from alternative financing sources, in an amount sufficient to make
the Closing Date Payments and any payments pursuant to Section 2.06 and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, and (iii) use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain, and when obtained, provide Parent and the
Sellers with a copy of, a replacement financing commitment in accordance with
Section 5.15(a)(i) that provides for such alternative financing.

 

(c)As promptly as practicable following the receipt of the financial
information required by clause (A) of the definition of Financing Information,
Holdings shall prepare and file with the SEC a prospectus supplement to its
currently effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 with respect to, and
commence an offering of, the common stock of Holdings (the "Common Stock
Offering"), which Buyer will use to pay a portion of the Purchase Price for
the Equity Interests on the Closing Date.

 

(d)As promptly as practicable following the consummation of the Common Stock
Offering (and in any event following the receipt of the financial information
required by clause (A) of the definition of Financing Information), Holdings
shall prepare and file with the SEC and deliver to holders of its common stock
a prospectus supplement for a rights offering on the terms and conditions
described in the Parent Backstop generating gross proceeds to Holdings of no
less than $125 million less the net proceeds received by Holdings pursuant to
the Common Stock Offering (the "Subscription Rights Offering").

 

(e)Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall promptly notify Parent upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC
or its staff with respect to

   

the Common Stock Offering or the Subscription Rights Offering, and Buyer and
Holdings shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between it and
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other
hand, relating to the Common Stock Offering or the Subscription Rights
Offering or the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer and Holdings shall use
their reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Common Stock Offering or the
Subscription Rights Offering or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.16. Debt Financing Cooperation.

 

(a)Parent and the Sellers shall, and shall cause the Business Entities to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to have its and their Representatives to
provide such cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing, pre-Closing capital raises, or to facilitate Buyer's post-
acquisition planning as is reasonably requested by Buyer; provided, that
Parent, the Sellers and the Business Entities shall in no event be required to
provide such assistance that shall unreasonably interfere with its business
operations. Such assistance shall include the following:

 

(i)participation by the senior management team of Parent, Sellers and the
Business Entities in the marketing activities undertaken in connection with
the marketing of the Debt Financing, including (A) preparation of the
Marketing Material and due diligence sessions related thereto, (B) a
reasonable number of road shows and meetings with prospective lenders and debt
investors and (C) delivery of customary authorization letters, confirmations
and undertakings in connection with the Marketing Material (including with
respect to the presence or absence of material non-public information and
accuracy of the information contained therein); provided, that such letters
and confirmations expressly state that the Business Entities shall not have
any liability of any kind or nature resulting from the use of information
contained in the Marketing Material or otherwise in connection with their
cooperation with arranging the Debt Financing, unless and until Closing Date
occurs;

 

(ii)participation by senior management of the Business Entities in, and
assistance with, the preparation of rating agency presentations and meetings
with rating agencies;

 

(iii)delivery to Buyer and its Financing Sources (including, for the purposes
of this Section 5.16(a)(iii), the agents, arrangers, lenders and other
entities that have committed to provide or arrange or otherwise entered into
agreements in connection with all or any part of a financing other than the
Debt Financing or an equity financing) of the Financing Information and
Financing Deliverables;

 

(iv)participation by senior management of the Business Entities in the
drafting and negotiation of the Debt Financing Documents;

 

(v)taking such actions as are reasonably requested by Buyer or its Financing
Sources to facilitate the satisfaction on a timely basis of all Financing
Conditions that require their cooperation or are within their control,
including (A) cooperating in

   

connection with applications to obtain such consents, approvals or
authorizations which may be necessary or desirable in connection with the Debt
Financing, (B) forming new direct or indirect Subsidiaries and transferring
assets to such Subsidiaries, provided that Parent, its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates (other than the Business Entities) would not suffer adverse
financial or tax consequences, and the Business Entities would not suffer
adverse financial or tax consequences prior to or in the absence of the
Closing;

 

(vi)having officers execute, without personal liability, and deliver
reasonably necessary officers' certificates or management representation
letters to the independent auditors (for the avoidance of doubt, persons who
are directors of the Business Entities prior to the Closing in their capacity
as such shall not be required to pass resolutions to approve or authorize the
execution of the Debt Financing;

 

(vii)requesting that its independent auditors as of the Closing cooperate with
the Debt Financing, including by providing customary comfort letters
(including "negative assurance" comfort); and

 

(viii)using reasonable best efforts to permit Buyer to be able to provide
lenders with the collateral package required by them in connection with any
financing, in a form satisfactory to the Financing Sources.

 

(b)Parent and the Sellers shall have the right to review and comment on
Marketing Material prior to the dissemination of such materials to potential
lenders or other counterparties to any proposed financing transaction (or
filing with any Governmental Authority); provided, that Parent and the Sellers
shall communicate in writing their comments, if any, to Buyer and its counsel
within a reasonable period of time under the circumstances and consistent with
the time accorded to other participants who were asked to review and comment
on such Marketing Material. No Transferred Entity or Transferred Subsidiary
shall be required to agree to any contractual obligation relating to the Debt
Financing that is not conditioned upon the Closing and that does not terminate
without Liability to each Transferred Entity and Transferred Subsidiary and
their Affiliates (including Parent and the Sellers) upon the termination of
this Agreement.

 

(c)Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent, the Sellers and their
Subsidiaries (other than, following the Closing, the Business Entities), and
each of their respective Representatives from and against any and all
Liabilities suffered or incurred in connection with the Debt Financing or any
assistance or activities provided in connection therewith; provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not apply in Parent's, the Sellers' or their
respective Subsidiaries' or other Representatives' willful misconduct or gross
negligence. Buyer shall promptly reimburse Parent, the Sellers or the Business
Entities for all documented out-of-pocket third party costs incurred by
Parent, the Sellers or the Business Entities in connection with such
cooperation.

 

(d)Buyer acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the Debt Financing is not a
condition to Closing. None of Parent, the Sellers or any Non-Business
Subsidiary shall have any obligations under this Section 5.16 following the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

   

Section 5.17. Indemnification and Exculpation.

 

(a)From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause each Business
Entity to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted under Law, the Organizational Documents of the applicable Business
Entity and indemnification agreements, in each case, in effect as of the date
of this Agreement, the individuals who on or prior to the Closing Date were
directors or officers of such Business Entity (collectively, the "DandO
Indemnitees"), as applicable, with respect to all acts or omissions by them in
their capacities as such or taken at the request of such Business Entity at
any time prior to the Closing Date. Buyer agrees that all rights of the DandO
Indemnitees to indemnification and exculpation from Liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date pursuant to any
Organizational Documents, indemnification agreements or other arrangements of
each Business Entity shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms, and otherwise to the fullest
extent permitted by Law. Such rights shall not be amended, or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the DandO
Indemnitees, unless such modification is required by applicable Law.

 

(b)If any Action is asserted or made with respect to which a DandO Indemnitee
may seek or obtain indemnification hereunder, any determination required to be
made with respect to whether a DandO Indemnitee's conduct complies with the
standards set forth under Law, any Organizational Documents or any
indemnification agreements or arrangements of the Business Entities shall be
made by independent legal counsel selected by such DandO Indemnitee and
reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

 

(c)Buyer and each DandO Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate, and cause their
respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense of any such Action and
shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and
furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 

(d)If Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Buyer shall assume all of the obligations thereof
set forth in this Section 5.17.

 

(e)Buyer understands and agrees that, prior to the Closing, the Business
Entities intend to obtain a prepaid six-year "tail" insurance policy that
provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Closing Date, on terms no
less favorable to the insured than the coverage provided under the Business
Entities' current directors' and officers' insurance policy, for the Persons
who are covered by such policy on the date of this Agreement; provided,
however, that the Business Entities' shall not pay an aggregate premium in
excess of 200% of the aggregate amount per annum paid for such coverage in the
last full fiscal year prior to the date hereof, which amount Parent has
disclosed to Buyer prior to the date hereof, but may purchase such coverage as
may be obtained for such 200% amount. Parent agrees that, prior to the
Business Entities purchasing any such policy, the Business Entities shall
afford Buyer the opportunity to

   

purchase a substitute policy which (i) has an effective term of six years from
the Closing Date, (ii) covers those Persons who are currently covered by the
Business Entities' current directors' and officers' insurance policy for
actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, and (iii)
contains terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the insured than
those of the Business Entities' current directors' and officers' insurance
policy; provided, however, that in satisfying its obligation under this
Section 5.1(e) Buyer shall not be obligated to pay an aggregate premium per
annum in excess of 200% of the aggregate amount paid for such coverage in the
last full fiscal year prior to the date hereof, but shall be obligated to
purchase such coverage as may be obtained for such 200% amount.

 

(f)The obligations of Buyer under this Section 5.17 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnitee to whom
this Section 5.17 applies without the consent of the affected DandO Indemnitee.
The provisions of this Section 5.17 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnitee and such DandO Indemnitee's
heirs and Representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by Contract, at Law or otherwise.

 

Section 5.18. Notice of Certain Events. Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer
shall give Parent, and Parent shall give Buyer, prompt written notice if such
Party becomes aware of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event
or the existence of any condition that has caused or would reasonably be
likely to cause any of its representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement to be inaccurate or breached in any material respect at any time
from and after the date of this Agreement, up to and including the Closing
Date (except to the extent such representations and warranties are given as of
a specific date or period and relate solely to such specific date or period
and then as to such earlier date), (b) any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Authority or third party in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and under the Transaction
Documents, (c) any written communication from any Person to such Party
alleging that a Third Party Approval of or by such Person (or another Person)
is required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (d) any Action commenced or threatened against such Party that
arises out of the transactions completed by this Agreement, and (e) any
development that would reasonably be expected to result in a failure of a
condition set forth in Article VIII. The delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 5.18 shall not cure any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect
the remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice.

 

Section 5.19. Acquisition Proposals.

 

(a)From the date hereof through the earlier of the Closing Date and the date
of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article X, as applicable, Parent
shall not, and shall cause each Seller and their respective Affiliates not to,

Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (except with respect to Buyer,
this Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby):

   

(i)solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate any inquiries, proposals, offers
or other indications of interest by or from any Person with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal;

 

(ii)participate in any discussions, conversations, negotiations or other
communications with any Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other

Agreement);

 

(iii)furnish or confirm any information to any Person in connection with
inquiries by such Person regarding an Acquisition Proposal;

 

(iv)otherwise assist, facilitate or encourage the making of, or cooperate in
any way regarding, any inquiry, proposal, offer or other indication of
interest by or from any Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; or

 

(v)enter into any term sheet, letter of intent, agreement or other non-binding
or binding understanding or arrangement with, or accept or agree to any terms
of any offer or proposal by or from, any Person other than Buyer with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b)From the date hereof through the earlier of the Closing Date and the date
of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article X, as applicable, Parent
shall, and shall cause each Seller and each of their respective Affiliates to,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to, cease and terminate immediately any existing discussions
or negotiations with respect to or in furtherance of any Acquisition Proposal
with any Person other than Buyer; and

 

(c)For purposes of this Section 5.19, "Acquisition Proposal" means the making
or receiving of an offer or proposal regarding any of the following
transactions (but excluding, in each case, this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby):

 

(i)the acquisition, purchase or other transfer by way of (A) share sale, spin-
off, split-off or any other transaction, directly or indirectly, of an equity
interest or interests of any Business Entity or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of
Parent owning, directly or indirectly, assets, liabilities or equity interests
constituting all or any material part of, the business of any Business Entity
or (B) sale of assets constituting all or any material part of the business of
any Business Entity (other than pursuant to a sale of products or services in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice); or

 

(ii)a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or other business
combination transaction involving Parent or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of
Parent constituting all or any material part of, or owning, directly or
indirectly, assets or equity interests constituting all or any material part
of, the business of any Business Entity.

 

(d)In the event that Parent, Sellers, the Business Entities or any Affiliate
of any of them receives an Acquisition Proposal, the Person receiving such
Acquisition Proposal shall

   

promptly, but in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours thereafter, notify
Buyer in writing of such proposal and provide a copy thereof (if in written or
electronic form) or, if in oral form, a general summary of the terms and
conditions thereof (e.g., the type of consideration and any material
conditions) which may exclude the names of the interested parties.

 

(e)During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing,
Parent shall not, and shall cause the Sellers and each of their respective
Subsidiaries to not, without the prior written consent of Buyer, terminate,
amend, modify or waive any provision which prohibits a third party from
acquiring assets or securities of the Sellers (including transactions similar
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, other than the Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to
its terms or by written agreement of the parties thereto. During such period,
the Company shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, any such provision, including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any
material breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the material
terms and provisions thereof in any court of the United States of America or
of any state having jurisdiction.

 

Section 5.20. Other Covenants. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Business Entities to sell, transfer and convey the Owned Real
Property described on Schedule 5.20, including the Improvements thereon and
any Liabilities related thereto, to one or more Non-Business Subsidiary (such
Real Property, the "Discontinued Locations").

 

Section 5.21. Software Reimbursements. Parent shall reimburse Buyer for any
out-of-pocket costs and expenses that any Business Entity is required to pay
in order to obtain the transfer, assignment or acquisition of that number of
perpetual user licenses under the Hyperion, Oracle EBS and SAP agreements as
is set forth on Schedule 5.21.

 

Section 5.22. Further Assurances. In furtherance and not in limitation of
Sections 5.03, 5.05, 5.06 and 5.15, each of the Parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to (a) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) cause the satisfaction at
the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to their respective
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, that the foregoing shall in no event be interpreted to require any
Party to waive any condition precedent to its obligations to close the
transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at any time after the Closing, Parent and Buyer shall promptly
execute, acknowledge and deliver any documents reasonably requested by Parent
or Buyer, as the case may be, and necessary for Parent or Buyer, as the case
may be, to satisfy their respective obligations hereunder.

 

Article VI 
Tax Matters

 

Section 6.01. Responsibility for Taxes. The following provisions shall
govern the allocation of responsibility between Parent and Buyer for certain
Tax matters following the Closing Date.

 

(a)From and after the Closing, Parent agrees to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnitees against, and agrees to hold each of them harmless from, any and
all:

   

(i)Taxes imposed on any Business Entity with respect to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods;

 

(ii)Taxes imposed on any Person other than a Business Entity with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period for which such Business Entity is liable under Section
1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (or any similar provision of state, local
or non-U.S. Law), or as a transferee or successor;

 

(iii)Taxes resulting from or arising out of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections;

 

(iv)Taxes to the extent arising out of or resulting from any breach by Parent
or the Sellers of any covenant contained in Section 2.08 (Allocation of
Purchase Price) or this Article VI; and

 

(v)Transfer Taxes for which Parent is responsible pursuant to Section 6.01(c).

 

provided, however, that Parent shall have no obligation to indemnify any Buyer
Indemnitee for any (x) De Minimis Tax, (y) Taxes (including Taxes treated as
Transaction Expenses) taken into account as liabilities in the calculation of
Net Working Capital, or (z) Taxes described in Section 6.01(b).

 

(b)From and after the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify the Seller
Indemnitees against, and agrees to hold each of them harmless from, any and
all:

 

(i)Taxes imposed on Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer (including any Business
Entity) with respect to Post-Closing Tax Periods;

 

(ii)Taxes to the extent arising out of or resulting from any breach by Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (including the Business Entities after the Closing)
of any covenant contained in Section 2.08 (Allocation of Purchase Price),
Section 5.05(d) or this Article VI;

 

(iii)Buyer Taxes (including Taxes imposed on Aleris Deutschland with respect
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent these are imposed in relation to
income realized by Aleris Germany and allocated to Aleris Deutschland by
operation of the German Tax Group as a consequence of any action by Buyer or
Aleris Germany, unless and to the extent Aleris Germany has paid or pays an
amount equal to the relevant additional income that is the basis of the
additional Tax pursuant to Section 5.05(d));

 

(iv)Any Taxes imposed on, and any disadvantages from the denial of any losses
and loss carry forwards (Verluste und Verlustvortrage) (calculated on a
discounted cash basis) suffered by Aleris Deutschland in relation to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods as a consequence of a stand-alone taxation due to the
German Tax Authorities not accepting the operation of the German Tax Group
which is caused by a failure of Buyer or Aleris Germany to comply with their
obligations pursuant to Section 5.05(d); and

 

(v)Transfer Taxes for which German Buyer is responsible pursuant to Section
6.01(c).

   

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and
German Buyer shall each be responsible for one-half of any Transfer Taxes.

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
indemnification obligations contained in this Section 6.01 shall survive the
Closing Date until thirty (30) days after expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be
required to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees for any Taxes more than once (even if
Buyer Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification for such Taxes pursuant to
more than one provision contained in this Agreement).

 

Section 6.02. Apportionment of Taxes.

 

(a)To the extent necessary for purposes of this Agreement, with respect to
Taxes of any Business Entity for any Straddle Period, (i) any Tax based on or
measured by income, receipts, services or transactions (including Income Taxes
and sales, use, withholding, payroll and other employment taxes, but not
including real and personal property taxes) shall be apportioned between the
Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period
based on an interim closing of the books as of 12:00 A.M., Eastern Time, on
the Closing Date, and (ii) any Tax not described in clause (i) of this Section
6.02 shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-
Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period by multiplying the total amount of
such Tax by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period up to and including the Closing Date (in the case of the Pre-
Closing Tax Period), or following the Closing Date (in the case of the Post-
Closing Tax Period), and the denominator of which is the total number of days
in such Straddle Period.

 

(b)To the extent permitted or required by Law, all transactions that are
properly allocable to the portion of the Closing Date after the Closing
(including transactions occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing that
are not in the ordinary course of business), shall be treated as having
occurred at the beginning of the day immediately following the Closing Date
and shall be reported on Income Tax Returns of Buyer or its Affiliates rather
than on any Seller Group Tax Return to the extent permitted or required by
Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) of the Treasury Regulations (or any similar
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law).

 

Section 6.03. Tax Returns.

 

(a)Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
when due all Tax Returns required to be filed for taxable periods of each
Business Entity other than Aleris Germany ending on or before the Closing
Date, and shall pay or cause to be paid any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns. To the extent such Taxes (including Taxes treated as Transaction
Expenses) are taken into account as liabilities in the calculation of Net
Working Capital, Parent shall provide Buyer with written notice of such
payment, and within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such written notice
of payment, Buyer shall reimburse Parent for such Taxes. No later than ninety
(90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause each Business Entity to
furnish to Parent Tax information relating to such Business Entity, consistent
with the past practice and custom of Sellers and such Business Entity.

   

(b)Buyer shall procure that Aleris Germany (i) shall instruct a German tax
adviser selected by Parent to prepare (observing comments and instructions of
the Parent) all annual Tax Returns required to be filed for taxable periods of
Aleris Germany ending on or before the Closing Date, (ii) shall review and
sign off on the draft Tax Returns and (iii) instruct the tax adviser to file
such Tax Returns when due. Parent shall pay or cause to be paid any Taxes due
and payable by Aleris Germany in respect of such Tax Returns (except to the
extent such Taxes (including Taxes treated as Transaction Expenses) are taken
into account as liabilities in the calculation of Net Working Capital). No
later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause Aleris
Germany to furnish to Parent and the tax adviser Tax information relating to
it, consistent with the past practice and custom of the Sellers and Aleris
Germany.

 

(c)Except as provided in Section 6.03(a), Section 6.03(b) and Section 6.03(e),
Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed when
due all Tax Returns required to be filed by any Business Entity, and shall pay
or cause to be paid any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.

 

(d)Any Tax Return required to be filed with respect to a Straddle Period of
any Business Entity shall be prepared in accordance with the past practice and
custom of Sellers and such Business Entity and shall be submitted (with copies
of any relevant schedules, work papers and other documentation then available)
to Parent for Parent's written approval not less than thirty (30) days prior
to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return, which written approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Parent shall have
the option of providing to Buyer, at any time at least fifteen (15) days prior
to the due date, written instructions as to the manner in which any, or all,
of the items for which it may be liable hereunder shall be reflected on such
Tax Return. Buyer shall, in preparing such Tax Return, cause the items for
which Parent may be liable hereunder to be reflected in accordance with
Parent's instructions, to the extent permitted by Law.

 

(e)The Person required by applicable Law to file any Tax Returns or other
documentation with respect to any Transfer Taxes shall prepare and file such
Tax Returns or other documentation and pay the Taxes due with respect thereto.
Parent and Buyer shall each, and shall each cause their Affiliates to,
cooperate in the timely preparation and filing of, and join in the execution
of, any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

 

(f)To the extent a party pays Taxes pursuant to this Section 6.03 for which
such party is not responsible under Section 6.01, the paying party shall, in
good faith, provide the other party's representative (Parent or Buyer, as the
case may be), with written notice of such payment, and within ten (10)
Business Days of receipt of such written notice of payment, the non-paying
party's representative shall reimburse the paying party for the non-paying
party's share of the paid Taxes.

 

Section 6.04. Tax Elections.

 

(a)Parent shall join and cooperate with Buyer in making elections under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and under any comparable provisions of state
or local Law) with respect to the purchase of those Section 338(h)(10)
Companies designated by Buyer (the "Section 338(h)(10) Elections"). Buyer
shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of IRS Forms

   

8023 and 8883 and any other forms necessary to effectuate any Section
338(h)(10) Elections, in each case in accordance with applicable Law, and
shall provide Parent with completed copies of all such forms. At the request
of Buyer, Parent shall execute any such forms.

 

(b)Buyer shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to make an election
under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the purchase or deemed
purchase of any Business Entity.

 

Section 6.05. Cooperation On Tax Matters.

 

(a)Subject to Section 6.05(b), Buyer and Parent shall and shall cause their
Affiliates to cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
any party, in connection with any Tax Claim and the filing of any Tax Returns.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's
request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Claim and making employees available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. Buyer and Parent shall and shall cause
their Affiliates to (x) retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period of any
Business Entity until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to
the extent notified by a Business Entity or Parent, any extensions thereof) of
the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (y) give the other
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records and, if the other so requests, Buyer or Parent, as the
case may be, shall allow the other to take possession of such books and
records.

 

(b)No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require Parent or any
Seller to provide to any Person, before, on or after the Closing Date, any
right to access or to review any Tax Return or Tax work papers of Parent, any
Seller, any Seller Group, or any Affiliate of any Seller (including any
consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary Tax Return that includes any
Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller, and any pro forma Tax Return used to
create any such consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary Tax Return).

 

(c)Parent shall, and shall cause Aleris Deutschland to and Buyer shall, and
shall cause Aleris Germany to, cooperate in good faith as set out in Section
5.05(d), in order to safeguard the operation of the German Tax Group, and
provide without undue delay any relevant information requested by the other
party.

 

Section 6.06. Tax Claims.

 

(a)If a claim for Taxes, including notice of a pending audit, shall be made by
any Taxing Authority, that, if successful, might result in a claim for
indemnity under Section 6.01 or might in the absence of the German Tax Group
result in such claim (any such claim for Taxes, a "Tax Claim"), the party
which receives such Tax Claim shall notify the other party in writing within
fifteen (15) days of receipt of such Tax Claim; provided, that the failure to
give such notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder
except to the extent that a party has actually been prejudiced by such
failure.

 

(b)Parent shall control any Tax Claim with respect to any Seller Group Tax
Return, and Buyer may not participate in or control, any such Tax Claim.
Where the cooperation of

   

Buyer or a Business Entity is required under applicable administrative law,
Buyer shall, and shall cause that the relevant Business Entity to, co-operate
and act, to the extent permissible and to the extent such action will not
result in an increase of Tax Liability for the Buyer (provided that Parent
does not agree to hold harmless Buyer or the relevant Person against such
increase of Tax Liability), according to the instructions of Parent.

 

(c)With respect to any other Tax Claim relating to a taxable period of a
Business Entity ending on or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall have the
right to control the conduct of such Tax Claim unless Parent fails to provide
Buyer with written notice of its election to control such Tax Claim within ten
(10) days of Parent's receipt of notice of such Tax Claim in accordance with
Section 6.06(a); provided, however, that (i) Parent shall keep Buyer
reasonably informed as to the status of such Tax Claim and (ii) if the
resolution of such Tax Claim would reasonably be expected to result in any
additional Tax Liability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Business Entities) for any Post-Closing Tax Period, then Buyer shall be
entitled to participate in any such Tax Claim and Parent shall not settle or
otherwise compromise such Tax Claim without Buyer's written consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If Parent does
not elect to control a Tax Claim pursuant to this Section 6.06(c) within the
time period set forth above, then Buyer shall control such Tax Claim;
provided, however, that (A) Buyer shall keep Parent reasonably informed as to
the status of such Tax Claim and (B) Buyer shall not settle or otherwise
compromise such Tax Claim without Parent's written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(d)With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Straddle Period of a Business
Entity, to the extent possible the Tax Items that are the subject of such Tax
Claim shall be distinguished and each party shall control the defense and
settlement of those Tax Items that relate primarily to Taxes for which such
party is responsible under Section 6.01 and Section 6.02. If any Tax Item
cannot be identified as relating primarily to Taxes that are the
responsibility of one party or cannot be separated from a Tax Item that
relates to Taxes for which the other party is responsible, the party that
stands to gain the most (or lose the least) from a successful defense or
settlement of those Tax Items that cannot be so attributed or separated (or
both) shall control the defense and settlement of the Tax Claim. The
controlling party shall keep the other reasonably informed as to the status of
such Tax Claim and if the resolution of such Tax Claim would reasonably be
expected to result in a material Tax Liability of the non-controlling party or
any of its Affiliates, then the non-controlling party shall be entitled to
participate in the Tax Claim and the controlling party shall not settle or
otherwise compromise such Tax Claim without the non-controlling party's
written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 

Section 6.07. Pre-Closing Actions Relating to Taxes. Any and all existing
Tax Sharing Agreements between any Business Entity, on the one hand, and
Parent and any of its Affiliates (other than any Business Entity), on the
other hand, shall be terminated as of the Closing Date. After such date none
of the Business Entities shall have any rights or obligations under any such
terminated Tax Sharing Agreement.

 

Section 6.08. Post-Closing Actions Relating to Taxes.

   

(a)Buyer shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to amend, refile or
otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period of any Business Entity without Parent's prior written
consent, which consent may be withheld in Parent's sole discretion.

 

(b)Buyer shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to carry back to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period any operating losses, net operating losses, capital
losses, tax credits or similar items arising in, resulting from, or generated
in connection with a Post-Closing Tax Period.

 

(c)Parent shall be entitled to any Tax refunds (including any interest
included therein by the applicable Taxing Authority) of or relating to any
Business Entity for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, including any Tax refunds for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period that take the form of a credit against the Tax
liability of any Business Entity. In the case of a refund of Taxes relating
to a Straddle Period, such refund shall be equitably apportioned between the
Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle
Period. If Buyer or any of its Affiliates receives any refund to which (or to
a portion of which) Parent is entitled, Buyer shall, within five (5) days of
receipt, pay, or cause to be paid, the amount (or portion thereof) of such
refund (including any interest included therein by the Taxing Authority) to
Parent.

 

(d)Buyer shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to take any action with
respect to any Business Entity subsequent to the Closing that could cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to constitute part of a
transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, the
"Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described in IRS Notices 2001-16 and
2008-111.

 

(e)Buyer shall be entitled to any Tax refunds (including any interest included
therein by the applicable Taxing Authority) of or relating to any Business
Entity for any Post-Closing Tax Period. In the case of a refund of Taxes
relating to a Straddle Period, such refund shall be equitably apportioned
between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period of such
Straddle Period. If Parent receives any refund to which (or to a portion of
which) Buyer is entitled, Parent shall, within five (5) days of receipt, pay,
or cause to be paid, the amount (or portion thereof) of such refund (including
any interest included therein by the Taxing Authority) to Buyer.

 

Article VII 
Employee Matters

 

Section 7.01. Employees.

 

(a)Subject in each case to all applicable Laws and the provisions of any
Bargaining Agreement, effective no later than immediately prior to the
Closing, (i) Parent shall cause all Business Employees to be employed by a
Business Entity and (ii) Buyer or a Business Entity as designated by Buyer
shall assume all obligations of Parent under each individual retention and
severance agreement listed in Schedule 1.01(d) on the Closing.

 

(b)For the one-year period following the Closing Date or such longer period as
may be required by applicable Law or Contract, the Business Entities shall
provide the Business Employees with (i) compensation, including base salary,
that is at least equal to the compensation, including base salary, that is in
effect for Business Employees immediately prior

   

to the Closing and (ii) benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the compensation and benefits provided to such Business Employees
immediately prior to Closing; provided, that for purposes of determining
comparability, any retention bonuses and de minimis fringe benefits shall be
disregarded, and provided further that comparable compensation and benefits
for these purposes shall not include any equity compensation plans, programs
or opportunities.

 

(c)Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall (i) give each Business Employee credit for
such Business Employee's service with Parent and its Subsidiaries under each
employee benefit plan and personnel policy of Buyer or its Subsidiaries that
covers such Business Employee after the Closing Date (including any vacation,
sick leave and severance policies) for purposes of eligibility and vesting,
(ii) use commercially reasonable best efforts to allow such Business Employee
to participate in each plan of Buyer providing welfare benefits (including
medical, dental, vision, life insurance, short-term and long-term disability
insurance) without regard to preexisting-condition limitations, waiting
periods, evidence of insurability or other exclusions or limitations not
imposed on such Business Employee by the corresponding Employee Plans which
such Business Employees participated in immediately prior to Closing
(collectively, the "Applicable Plans"), and (iii) use commercially reasonable
best efforts to credit such Business Employee with any expenses that were
covered by the Applicable Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date for
purposes of determining deductibles, co-pays and other applicable limits under
any similar replacement plans, except in each case of clauses (i) through
(iii) above, where such crediting would result in duplicate benefits with
respect to the same period of service and only to the same extent such service
was credited under the Applicable Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

(d)Notwithstanding Section 7.01(b), the Business Entities shall (i) following
the Closing Date, for the avoidance of doubt, be solely responsible for any
retention, bonus, commission and severance-type benefits owed to any Business
Employee or former Business Entity employee and (ii) until December 31, 2015
continue to provide or make available to eligible U.S. Business Employees not
covered under a Bargaining Agreement, the Severance Arrangements (or the
equivalent thereof). All payments owed to any Business Employee or former
Business Entity employee related to a change in control event, severance and
bonuses related to the consummation of the transaction contemplated under this
Agreement or arising prior to the Closing Date shall be listed on Schedule
7.01(d). 

 

(e)Parent and the Non-Business Subsidiaries shall remain responsible for all,
and shall pay and perform when due, all obligations and liabilities under each
Employee Plan that is not (i) a Transferred Entity Plan or (ii) an Employee
Plan matured by Buyer or its Subsidiary after the Closing Date (an "Excluded
Plan"), whether arising prior to, on or after the Closing Date, including any
such liabilities arising out of the status of the Business Entities as an
ERISA Affiliate of Parent or any of the Non-Business Subsidiaries prior to
Closing, except in each case to the extent such obligations or liabilities are
expressly assumed by the Business Entities under this Agreement or any
transition services agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and the
Non-Business Subsidiaries shall remain responsible for any and all claims
(including incurred but not reported claims) relating to any Parent Plan that
is a welfare benefit plan to the extent that such claims are incurred prior to
the Closing Date.

   

(f)This Section 7.01 shall survive the Closing and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Sellers, Buyer and the Business
Entities. Nothing set forth in this Section 7.01 shall confer any rights or
remedies upon any employee or former employee of the Business Entities, any
Business Employee or upon any other Person other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns or shall constitute an amendment to
any Transferred Entity Plan or any other plan or arrangement covering the
Business Employees. Nothing in this Section 7.01 shall obligate Buyer or the
Business Entities to continue the employment of any Business Employee for any
specific period.

been primarily caused by, or is primarily the result of, such Party's failure

Article IX 
Indemnification

 

Section 9.01. Survival. The representations and warranties of the Parties
contained in this Agreement and all covenants and agreements of the Parties
that are to be performed prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing for a
period of eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date; provided, that (i) the
Fundamental Representations and the representations and warranties contained
in Sections 4.01 (Organization and Qualification), 4.02 (Authorization), 4.07
(Solvency), 4.08 (Brokers) and 4.09 (Purchase for Investment) shall survive
the Closing indefinitely, (ii) the representations and warranties contained in
Sections 3.13(c) (Title IV of ERISA) and 3.14 (Taxes) shall survive the
Closing until sixty (60) days following the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations taking into account an extensions or waivers thereof
and shall terminate and expire, and shall cease to be of any force or effect,
as of such date and (iii) the representations and warranties contained in
Section 3.11 (Environmental Matters) shall survive for a period of forty-eight
(48) months after the Closing Date and shall terminate and expire, and shall
cease to be of any force or effect, as of such date. All of the covenants
contained in this Agreement that by their nature are required to be performed
after the Closing shall survive the Closing until fully performed or
fulfilled, unless and only to the extent that non-compliance with such
covenants or agreements is waived in writing by the Party entitled to such
performance. Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, in the event that a
valid claim for indemnification has been asserted in good faith in accordance
with Section 9.03 and such claim remains unresolved as of the expiration of
the applicable survival period as set forth in this Section 9.01, then the
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty (as applicable) that is the
subject of such claim shall survive solely with respect to such claim until it
is finally resolved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent
have any indemnification obligations for any Damages incurred by Buyer for any
of the Reserved Environmental Matters (as defined below in Section
9.02(a)(i)(B)) after eighty-four (84) months after the Closing Date (such
period, the "Reserved Environmental Matters Period"), regardless of whether a
claim for indemnification with respect to any such Reserved Environmental
Matter remains unresolved; provided that if, on the date that is eighty-four
(84) months after the Closing Date, Buyer has incurred Damages for the
Reserved Environmental Matters in an aggregate amount equal to or greater than
$19,107,200, then the Reserved Environmental Matters Period shall be extended
for an additional twenty-four (24) months. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that with respect to any claim that any Party may have against any other Party
that is permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the survival
periods set forth and agreed to in this Section 9.01 shall govern when any
such claim may be brought and shall replace and supersede any statute of
limitations that may otherwise be applicable.

 

Section 9.02. Indemnification. Except with respect to indemnification for
Taxes, which is governed exclusively by Article VI:

   

(a)Subject to the provisions of this Article IX, including the limitations set
forth in Section 9.04, effective at and after the Closing, Parent agrees to
indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
successors, permitted assigns, agents and representatives and the Transferred
Entities (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") against and agrees to hold
each of them harmless from, against and in respect of any and all Damages
imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by any Buyer Indemnitee to the
extent arising out of or relating to:

 

(i)any breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or the Sellers in
Article III of this Agreement; provided, however, for purposes of this Article
IX and for purposes of determining whether a Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.02(a)(i), (A) any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent or the Sellers
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto
(other than the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.06,
3.07 and 3.10) shall be determined without regard to any materiality
qualifications set forth in such representation or warranty or in any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto, and all references to the terms
"material", "materially", "materiality" "Material Adverse Effect" or any
similar terms shall be ignored for purposes of determining whether such
representation or warranty was true and correct when made and (B) any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent or
the Sellers in Section 3.11 (Environmental Matters) of this Agreement with
respect to the matters set forth in Schedule 9.02(a)(i)(B) (the "Reserved
Environmental Matters") shall be determined without regard to any disclosure
in Schedule 3.11 for purposes of determining whether such representation or
warranty was true and correct when made;

 

(ii)any breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Parent
or the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement;

 

(iii)without duplication, any Liability arising in connection with or relating
to any Retained Business;

 

(iv)the Discontinued Locations, including relating to any business activities
carried out thereon at any time, any claims related to Environmental Laws
applicable to the ownership or operation of such Discontinued Locations or any
claims related to employees, independent contractors or others who performed
services at such Discontinued Locations;

 

(v)the litigation set forth on Schedule 9.02(a)(v);

 

(vi)any Transaction Expenses not taken into account in calculating the
Preliminary Cash Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.04(d);

 

(vii)any Liability arising from all properties owned or leased by the Parent
and the Sellers but not transferred under this Agreement; or

 

(viii)with respect to the Goodyear, Arizona facility, (1) in the event within
four years of the Closing (a) the facility is ordered to be closed by a
Governmental Authority

   

or (b) a Governmental Authority imposes conditions on the facility that Buyer
determines in good faith from the perspective of a reasonable person acting
without regard to indemnification cannot be reasonably achieved as a result of
the cost of (x) water treatment in order to conduct wet milling or (y)
landfill options to replace wet milling, in each case, as required by
applicable Environmental Law, and, therefore, Buyer decides to close the
facility, Buyer shall have an indemnification claim under this Agreement as
follows: (i) $8,800,000, if the facility is closed within two years following
the Closing; or (ii) $6,000,000, if the facility is closed after two years
(but prior to four years) following the Closing; or, in the alternative, (2)
in the event that the facility remains open, and a Governmental Authority
requires Buyer within four years of the Closing to incur Damages in order to
implement (x) water treatment in order to conduct wet milling or (y) landfill
options to replace wet milling, in each case, as required by applicable
Environmental Law, Buyer and Parent shall reasonably cooperate and Parent
shall indemnify Buyer for 50% of such Damages incurred by Buyer, with Parent's
share of such Damages not to exceed a total of $6,000,000. For the avoidance
of doubt, item 4 on Schedule 9.02(a)(i)(B) is not subject to indemnification
under this Section 9.02(a)(viii).

 

(b)Subject to the provisions of this Article IX, including the limitations set
forth in Section 9.04, effective at and after the Closing, Buyer agrees to
indemnify Parent, the Sellers and their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, successors, permitted assigns, agents and representatives
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") against and agrees to hold each of
them harmless from, against and in respect of any and all Damages imposed on,
sustained, incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnitee to the extent arising
out of or relating to:

 

(i)any breach of any representation or warranty of Holdings or Buyer in this
Agreement;

 

(ii)any breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Holdings or
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement; or

 

(iii)any Liability arising in connection with or relating to the Business or
any Business Entity to the extent solely arising out of the ownership or
operation of the Business by Buyer after the Closing and to the extent the
Buyer Indemnitees are not entitled to indemnification for Damages arising out
of or relating to such Liability pursuant to this Article IX.

 

Section 9.03. Procedures. Except with respect to Tax Claims, which are
governed exclusively by Article VI, claims for indemnification under this
Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 

(a)Any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee seeking indemnification under
this Agreement (an "Indemnified Party") with respect to any claim asserted
against the Indemnified Party by a third party ("Third Party Claim") in
respect of any matter that is subject to indemnification under Section 9.02
shall (i) promptly notify the other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") of the
Third Party Claim (and in any event within thirty (30) Business Days of the
date on which the Indemnified Party knows or reasonably should have known of
the Third Party Claim); provided, that the failure to so promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not limit the

   

indemnification obligations under this Agreement (so long as such notification
is given prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth
in Section 9.1) except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually
and materially prejudiced by such delay, and (ii) as promptly as practicable
transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (a "Claim Notice")
describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Third Party Claim, a copy of
all papers served with respect to such claim (if any), the basis of the
Indemnified Party's request for indemnification under this Agreement and, to
the extent practicable, a reasonable estimate of any Damages suffered with
respect thereto.

 

(b)The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party
against such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party will promptly notify
the Indemnified Party (and in any event within thirty (30) Business Days after
having received any Claim Notice) with respect to whether or not it is
exercising its right to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party
Claim. Prior to the time the Indemnified Party is notified by the
Indemnifying Party as to whether the Indemnifying Party will assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall take all
actions reasonably necessary to timely preserve the collective rights of the
parties with respect to such Third Party Claim, including responding timely to
legal process. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that
the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim
(such election to be without prejudice to the right of the Indemnifying Party
to dispute whether such claim is an indemnifiable Damage under this Article
IX), then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third
Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party, in all
appropriate proceedings, to a final conclusion or settlement at the discretion
of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Section 9.03(b). The
Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including any compromise or settlement thereof for which the Indemnifying
Party accepts responsibility; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party
shall not enter into any settlement agreement without the written consent of
the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); provided further that if the Indemnified Party does
not consent to any such compromise or settlement, the Indemnifying Party's
indemnification obligation to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third
Party Claim shall in no event exceed the amount of the settlement offer to
which the Indemnified Party withheld its consent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such consent shall not be required if (i) the settlement agreement
contains a complete and unconditional general release by the third party
asserting the Third Party Claim to all Indemnified Parties affected by the
Third Party Claim, (ii) the settlement agreement does not contain any sanction
or restriction upon the conduct or operation of any business conducted by the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, (iii) the Indemnifying Party is funding
the settlement, and (iv) the settlement agreement does not contain any
statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act,
by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party may
participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party
Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 9.03(b),
and the Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect
to such participation; provided, however, that any Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to participate in any such defense with counsel of its own choice at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party (such costs and expenses to be paid as
and when incurred) if representation of both parties by the same counsel is
reasonably likely to create a conflict of interest under applicable standards
of professional conduct for attorneys. If the Indemnifying Party fails to
take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently the action or proceeding
after notifying the Indemnified Party of its assumption

   

of the defense and investigation of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party may assume such defense, and the fees and expenses of its attorneys will
be covered by the indemnity provided for in this Article IX as such costs and
expenses are incurred.

 

(c)If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
9.03(b) within thirty (30) Business Days after receipt of any Claim Notice,
then the Indemnified Party shall defend itself against the applicable Third
Party Claim, and be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only
if the Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in
regard to the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party
and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, in all appropriate
proceedings and in good faith, which proceedings shall be prosecuted
diligently by the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified
Party shall defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith and have full
control of such defense and proceedings; provided, however, that the
Indemnified Party may not enter into any compromise or settlement of such
Third Party Claim if indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the
Indemnifying Party's consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may participate in,
but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Section 9.03(c), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its
own costs and expenses with respect to such participation; provided, however,
if at any time the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing that such Third
Party Claim is an indemnifiable Damage under this Article IX, the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim in
accordance with Section 9.03(b).

 

(d)If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees, at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (but only if the
Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder), to
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third
Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. In addition, the
Indemnified Party will make its personnel reasonably available at no cost to
the Indemnifying Party for conferences, discovery, proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party.

 

(e)A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party
Claim shall be asserted by notice to the Party from whom indemnification is
sought as promptly as practicable (and in any event within thirty (30)
Business Days of the date on which the Indemnified Party knows or reasonably
should have known of the claim for indemnification; provided that the failure
to give prompt notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its indemnification obligations (so long as such notification is given prior
to the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in Section 9.1)
unless the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such
delay), which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of the
claim, the basis of the Indemnified Party's request for indemnification under
this Agreement and, to the extent practicable, a reasonable estimate of any
Damages suffered with respect thereto.

 

(f)The party that has assumed the control or defense of any claim for
indemnification (regardless whether such claim for indemnification involves a
Third Party Claim) shall (i) provide the other party with the right to
participate in any meetings or

   

negotiations with any Governmental Authorities or other third parties and
reasonable advance notice of any such meetings or negotiations, (ii) provide
the other party with the right to review in advance and provide comments on
any draft or final documents proposed to be submitted to Governmental
Authorities or other third parties, (iii) and keep the other party reasonably
informed, and provide reasonable access to documents, records and information,
with respect to matters relating to the claim for indemnification, including,
at the reasonable request of the other party, providing copies of all
documents provided to, or received from, any Governmental Authority or any
other third party in connection with such matters. The Indemnifying Party and
Indemnified Party covenant and agree to maintain the confidence of all drafts
and comments provided by the other party.

 

Section 9.04. Limitations on Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein (excluding Article VI, to which this Section 9.04 shall not
apply):

 

(a)Parent shall not be liable for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of Parent or the Sellers set forth in this Agreement
attributable to a single course of conduct or related set of facts, events or
circumstances unless the amount of Damages actually incurred by the Buyer
Indemnitees for such breach exceeds $60,000 ("De Minimis Amount"); provided,
however, that the De Minimis Amount shall not apply to indemnification for
Damages arising out of or resulting from any breach of any Fundamental
Representation or the representations and warranties set forth in Sections
3.13(c) (Title IV of ERISA) and 3.14 (Taxes);

 

(b)Parent shall not be liable for (i) any breach of any representation or
warranty of Parent or the Sellers set forth in this Agreement or (ii) any
breach of Section 5.01, in either case, unless the aggregate amount of Damages
actually incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees for such breach and all other
breaches otherwise subject to indemnification hereunder exceeds $3,000,000
(the "Deductible"), and then only to the extent such aggregate Damages exceed
such amount; provided, however, that the Deductible shall not apply to
indemnification for Damages arising out of or resulting from any breach of any
Fundamental Representation, the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 3.13(c) (Title IV of ERISA) and 3.14 (Taxes) (and, for the avoidance
of doubt, Damages indemnifiable on account of any breach of any Fundamental
Representation shall not be counted towards the calculation of the Deductible)
or the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.11 (Environmental
Matters) with respect to the Reserved Environmental Matters, or Damages
indemnifiable pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(viii);

 

(c)Parent shall not be liable for any breach of any representation or warranty
of Parent or the Sellers of Section 3.11 with respect to the Reserved
Environmental Matters, unless the aggregate amount of Damages actually
incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees for such breach and all other breaches with
respect to Reserved Environmental Matters that are otherwise subject to
indemnification hereunder exceeds $23,884,000, and then only to the extent
such aggregate Damages exceed such amount;

 

(d)in no event shall Parent's aggregate Liability arising out of or relating
to Section 9.02(a)(i), Section 9.02(a)(ii) (on account of any breach of
Section 5.01) and Section 9.02(a)(viii) exceed $67,000,000 (the "Cap");
provided, however, that the Cap shall not apply to

   

indemnification for Damages arising out of or resulting from any breach of any
Fundamental Representation or the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 3.13(c) (Title IV of ERISA) and 3.14 (Taxes);

 

(e)notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall Parent's aggregate Liability arising out of or relating to Section 9.02
(a)(i), (ii) (but, in the case of 9.02(a)(ii), with respect to covenants to be
performed prior to the Closing) and Section 6.01(a) exceed the Purchase Price;

 

(f)Buyer Indemnitees shall not have a right to indemnification under any
provision of this Agreement for Damages to the extent that such Damages arise
out of actions taken (or omitted to be taken) by Buyer, the Business Entities
or any Buyer Indemnitee after the Closing Date;

 

(g)no Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article
IX to the extent a Liability or reserve relating to the matter giving rise to
such Damages has been included in the calculation of Final Net Working Capital
or to the extent such Buyer Indemnitee has otherwise been compensated with
respect thereto pursuant to the post-Closing adjustment contemplated by
Section 2.06. 

 

(h)For the avoidance of doubt, any indemnification provided hereunder by
Parent shall be so applied as to avoid any double counting and no Buyer
Indemnitee shall be entitled to obtain indemnification more than once for the
same matter or Damages. In addition, no exceptions to Parent's obligations to
provide indemnification hereunder shall be applied to create any double
counting of such exceptions;

 

(i)each Indemnified Party shall have a duty to use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any Damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, including incurring the minimum costs
necessary to remedy any breach that gives rise to such Damages;

 

(j)the amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Party claims
indemnification under this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount of (i) any
insurance proceeds actually received from third party insurers with respect to
such Damages; and (ii) any indemnification, contribution, offset or
reimbursement payments actually received from third parties with respect to
such Damages. If an Indemnified Party (A) actually receives insurance
proceeds from third party insurers with respect to such Damages, or (B)
actually receives indemnification, contribution, offset or reimbursement
payments from third parties with respect to such Damages, in each case, at any
time subsequent to any indemnification payment pursuant to this Article IX,
then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the applicable
Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such
Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification up to
such amount actually received by such Indemnified Party;

 

(k)notwithstanding anything provided under applicable Law, no Party shall have
any Liability (including, without limitation, under Article III or this
Article IX) for, and Damages shall not include, any punitive, incidental,
consequential, special or indirect Damages (including,

   

without limitation, lost profits or any damages that are based on a multiple
of earnings), in each case, except to the extent any such Damages are awarded
and paid with respect to a Third Party Claim as to which a Party is entitled
to indemnification under this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that
Damages based on a multiple of earnings theory shall not be expressly excluded
with respect to Damages resulting from a breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.06 (Financial Statements));

 

(l)in no event shall Parent have any indemnification obligations under this
Article IX to the extent Damages result from any voluntary sampling,
investigation or testing of any soil, sediment, groundwater, surface water or
building material, except to the extent such voluntary sampling, investigation
or testing is (i) required by Environmental Law or ordered by any Governmental
Authority (which requirement or order has not been solicited or instigated by
any Buyer Indemnitee) or (ii) a reasonably necessary response to an emergency
or to an imminent threat to public health or safety;

 

(m)for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent have any
indemnification obligations under this Article IX for any costs of operation,
closure or post-closure of the active landfills located in Wabash, Indiana and
Morgantown, Kentucky, except to the extent any such costs result from a
violation of Environmental Law existing on or before the Closing Date; and

 

(n)THE RIGHTS OF INDEMNIFICATION SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE IX SHALL BE
ENFORCEABLE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY PERSON (INCLUDING ANY INDEMNIFYING
PARTY) ALLEGES OR PROVES THE SOLE, CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE
NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY OR THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY
IMPOSED ON THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

 

Section 9.05. Assignment of Claims. If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
Section 9.02 and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of
such Damages from a third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on the
underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall, to the extent permitted by Law and any pertinent Contract, assign
such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are
necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential
Contributor the amount of such payment.

 

Section 9.06. Exclusivity.

 

(a)After the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims,
Damages or other matters arising under, out of, or related to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be the rights of
indemnification set forth in Section 6.01 and this Article IX only, and no
Person will have any other entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in
contract, tort, strict liability, equitable remedy or otherwise, it being
agreed that all of such other remedies, entitlements and recourse are
expressly waived and released by the Parties to the fullest extent permitted
by Law. This Section 9.06(a) will not operate to interfere with or impede the
operation of the covenants contained in this Agreement that by their nature
are required to be performed after the Closing, with respect to a Party's
right to seek equitable remedies (including specific performance or injunctive
relief). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this

   

Section 9.06(a) will not prevent or limit a cause of action and/or claim of
Damages (a) for, arising from, or relating to fraud or criminal conduct, (b)
to enforce any decision or determination of the Independent Firm, or (c) under
Section 11.09 to obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
any covenants set forth in this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions hereof. The provisions of this Section 9.06(a), together
with the covenants contained in this Agreement that by their nature are
required to be performed after the Closing, were specifically bargained-for
between the Sellers and Parent, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand,
and were taken into account by the Parties in arriving at the Purchase Price.
Each Party, respectively, specifically relied upon the provisions of this
Section 9.06(a) in agreeing to the Purchase Price and in agreeing to provide
the specific representations and warranties set forth in Article III (in the
case of Parent and the Sellers) and Article IV (in the case of Buyer).

 

(b)Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Buyer and its successors and assigns understand and agree that the
indemnification obligations of Parent under this Article IX shall constitute
the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer with respect to any matters or claims
arising under Environmental Laws, and Buyer and its successors and assigns
hereby waive, and unconditionally release Parent and the Sellers from, any
rights and remedies that Buyer and its successors and assigns may otherwise
have against Parent or the Sellers under any Environmental Law, including any
claims for contribution under CERCLA or common law.

 

Section 9.07. Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payment. The Parties agree that any
payments made pursuant to Section 6.01 or this Article IX shall be treated for
all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

 

Section 9.08. Claims Against Preferred Stock. 

 

(a)If Parent shall become obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee with
respect to any Damages pursuant to Section 9.02(a) or Section 6.01, the Buyer
Indemnitee shall recover for such Damages: 

 

(i)First, through a decrease in the number of shares of Preferred Stock issued
to Parent, to be effected as follows:

 

    

1)

 |  

First, any accrued but unpaid dividends on such Preferred Stock (if any) shall
be reduced by the total amount of such Damages; and 

---|--- 

 

    

2)

 |  

Second, Parent shall forfeit such number of shares of such Preferred Stock
having an aggregate remaining liquidation preference equal to the total amount
of such Damages, after taking into account clause (1) above. 

---|--- 

 

(ii)Thereafter, once the number of shares of Preferred Stock issued to Parent
has been reduced to zero pursuant to Section 9.08(a)(i), directly from Parent
in an amount equal to the total amount of such Damages.

   

Pursuant to the foregoing, Holdings, and its officers, directors and agents,
shall be entitled to effect any such reduction of Preferred Stock issued to
Parent on Holdings' books and records only upon (i) Parent's prior written
consent or (ii) a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

 

(b)Subject to the terms of this Section 9.08, on the date which is the
eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Escrow Release
Date"), Buyer and Parent shall promptly issue joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent authorizing the Escrow Agent to disburse to Parent the
remaining amount of the Escrow Funds; provided that in the event that Parent
has received, on or before the Escrow Release Date, an Unresolved Claim
Notice, then the portion of the Escrow Funds subject to such Unresolved Claim
Notice (the "Unresolved Claim Amount") shall continue to be held by the Escrow
Agent (and deducted from amounts to be disbursed on the Escrow Release Date)
until the portion of the Unresolved Claim Amount (if any) payable by Parent to
the Buyer Indemnitee with respect to such Unresolved Claim Notice has been
resolved.

 

(c)As soon as all claims set forth in an Unresolved Claim Notice have been
resolved, Buyer and Parent shall promptly issue joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent authorizing the Escrow Agent to disburse (i) to the
applicable Buyer Indemnitee, the portion of the Unresolved Claim Amount that
is required to be disbursed to such Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to this Article
IX in connection with such Unresolved Claim Notice, and (ii) to Parent, the
portion of the Unresolved Claim Amount with respect to such Unresolved Claim
Notice that is not required to be disbursed to such Buyer Indemnitee pursuant
to clause (i) of this Section 9.08(c).

 

Article X 
Termination

 

Section 10.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing:

 

(a)by mutual written agreement of Parent and Buyer;

 

(b)by Parent or Buyer if any Governmental Authority having competent
jurisdiction has issued a final, non-appealable order, decree, ruling or
injunction or taken any other Action permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, that this right of termination shall not be available to any Party
whose breach or failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement
has been the primary cause of, or has primarily resulted in, such order,
decree, ruling, injunction or other Action;

 

(c)by Parent or Buyer if any of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01,
8.02 and 8.03 of this Agreement, as applicable, have not been satisfied by the
other Party or waived by such first Party on or prior to April 30, 2015 (the
"Initial Outside Date" and, as the same may be extended in accordance with
this Section 10.01(c), the "Outside Date"); provided, that, if on the Initial
Outside Date all of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01, 8.02 and 8.03
have been satisfied or waived, other than the conditions (i) that by their
nature are to be satisfied by actions to be taken at Closing and (ii) set
forth in Section 8.01(a) (but solely with respect to Closing Legal Impediments
arising with respect to Competition Laws) or Section 8.01(b), then Buyer or

   

Parent may elect to extend the Initial Outside Date to May 31, 2015 by
providing written notice thereof to Parent or Buyer, as applicable, on or
prior to the Initial Outside Date; provided, further, that this right of
termination shall not be available to any Party whose breach or failure to
comply with its obligations under this Agreement has been the primary cause
of, or has primarily resulted in, the failure of any such conditions to be
satisfied before such date;

 

(d)by Buyer upon written notice to Parent, in the event of a breach of or
failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the
part of Parent or any Seller, such that the conditions specified in Section
8.02 would not be satisfied at the Closing, and which, (i) with respect to any
such breach or failure to perform that is capable of being cured, is not cured
by Parent or the applicable Seller within thirty (30) days after receipt of
written notice thereof, or (ii) is incapable of being cured prior to the
applicable Outside Date; provided, that Buyer shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(d) if it is then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement;

 

(e)by Parent upon written notice to Buyer, in the event of a breach of or
failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement on the part of Buyer, such that the conditions
specified in Section 8.03 would not be satisfied at the Closing, and which,
(i) with respect to any such breach or failure to perform that is capable of
being cured, is not cured by Buyer within thirty (30) days after receipt of
written notice thereof, or (ii) is incapable of being cured prior to the
applicable Outside Date; provided, that Parent shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(e) if Parent or any
Seller is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement; or

 

(f)by Parent, if (i) all of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.02
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing and those conditions that have not been satisfied
as a result of Buyer's breach of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letters
or the Debt Financing Documents) have been satisfied or waived, (ii) Parent
has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Buyer that (A) all of the conditions
set forth in Section 8.03 (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) have been satisfied or
have been waived by Parent and (B) Parent and the Sellers are prepared to
consummate the Closing, and (iii) Buyer fails to consummate the Closing within
five (5) Business Days of the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant
to Section 2.03 (after giving effect to any delays of the Closing Date
relating to the Marketing Period); provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt,
during such five (5) Business Day period following the date on which the
Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.03, no Party shall be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(c).

 

Section 10.02. Effect of Termination; Termination Fee.

 

(a)In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01,
this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and have no effect,
without any Liability on the part of any Party hereto; provided, however, that
the last sentence of Section 5.03(b) and the provisions of Section 5.14,
Section 5.16(c), this Section 10.02 and Article XI hereof shall survive

   

any termination of this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall not be
affected by a termination of this Agreement.

 

(b)In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to
Section 10.01(e) or Section 10.01(f) or (ii) by Parent or Buyer pursuant to
Section 10.01(c) at a time when this Agreement was terminable by Parent
pursuant to Section 10.01(e) (determined without regard to any applicable cure
period otherwise available thereunder) or Section 10.01(f), then, in either
case, Holdings shall, or shall cause Buyer to, promptly, but in no event later
than five (5) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay or cause
to be paid to Parent or its designees an amount equal to $26,250,000.00 (the
"Termination Fee") by wire transfer of immediately available funds. If
Holdings or Buyer fails to pay the Termination Fee when due, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences an Action that results in a judgment
against Holdings or Buyer for the Termination Fee, Holdings shall, or shall
cause Buyer to, pay to Parent, together with the Termination Fee, (A) interest
on the Termination Fee from the date of termination of this Agreement at a
rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate and (B) Parent's costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with such Action. Without
limiting Parent's right to obtain an award of specific performance permitted
by Section 11.09, solely for purposes of establishing the basis for the amount
thereof, and without in any way increasing the amount of the Termination Fee
or expanding the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is to be paid, it
is agreed that the Termination Fee is a liquidated damage, and not a penalty.
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Holdings or Buyer be required to
pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary, in the event that the Closing does not occur solely as a
result of Parent's breach of the Parent Backstop and this Agreement is
terminated in such a way as would give rise to payment of a Termination Fee,
no such Termination Fee shall be due or owing.

 

(c)In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.01(e)
or Section 10.01(f), or pursuant to Section 10.01(c) at a time when this
Agreement was terminable by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(e) or Section
10.01(f), Parent's receipt of the Termination Fee from Holdings or Buyer
pursuant to Section 10.02(b) and the payment of any other amounts due pursuant
to the last sentence of Section 5.03(b), Section 5.16(c) and Section 10.02(b)
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and the Sellers against
Holdings and Buyer and the former, current and future holders of any equity,
partnership or limited liability company interest, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners, stockholders, assignees of each of
Holdings and Buyer, and any future holders of any equity, partnership or
limited liability company interest, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or
limited partners, stockholders, assignees of any of the foregoing (the Persons
described in this Section 10.02(c)(i), collectively, the "Buyer Group") for
any Damages suffered as a result of any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth herein, or the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated.

 

(d)Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement, the Parent Backstop or any other Transaction Document may only be
brought against Persons that are expressly named as parties hereto or thereto.
No former, current or future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling
Persons, stockholders, directors, officers,

   

employees, members, managers, agents, Affiliates, general or limited partners
or assignees of the Parent, the Sellers, the Business Entities, Buyer,
Holdings, the Financing Sources or any former, current or future direct or
indirect equity holder, controlling Person, stockholder, director, officer,
employee, member, manager, general or limited partner, Affiliate, agent or
assignee of any of the foregoing shall have any Liability or obligation for
any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or
liabilities of the Parent, the Sellers, Holdings or Buyer under this Agreement
or of or for any Action based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Debt Financing) (including the
breach, termination or failure to consummate such transactions), in each case
whether based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any
assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable
Law or otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate
or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of any Party or
other Person or otherwise. Without limiting Section 10.02(e) below in any
respect, Parent and the Sellers hereby agree that they shall have no rights or
claims (whether based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the
enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue
of any applicable Law or otherwise and whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on
behalf of any Party or other Person or otherwise) against the Financing
Sources in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; provided, however, that nothing
in this Section 10.02(d) shall in any way limit or qualify the rights of
Parent and the Sellers against Buyer pursuant to the express provisions of
this Agreement (including their right to seek specific performance of Buyer's
obligations to cause the Financing Sources to fund the full amount of the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing, or otherwise to enforce Buyer's rights
under the Debt Commitment Letters, in the circumstances and on the terms and
conditions set forth in Section 5.15).

 

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Seller
Related Party (which shall not be deemed to include Holdings or Buyer) shall
have any rights or claims against any Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, and no Financing Source shall have any rights or claims against any
Seller Related Party (which shall not be deemed to include Holdings or Buyer)
in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise; provided that, following consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties to
the Debt Financing under any commitment letter related thereto. No Financing
Source shall be subject to any special, consequential, punitive or indirect
damages or damages of a tortuous nature.

 

(f)The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 10.02
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement.

in this Agreement are consummated, except as otherwise provided herein, each
Party shall pay its own expenses incident to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein.

 

Section 11.04. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

 

(a)This Agreement, and all Actions (whether in contract or tort) that may be
based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance hereof (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of
the State of New York, without regard to the choice of law or conflicts of law
principles thereof that could cause the application of the laws of another
state or jurisdiction. The Parties expressly waive any right they may have,
now or in the future, to demand or seek the application of a governing law
other than the law of the State of New York.

 

(b)Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States
District Court sitting in the State of New York located in New York County or,

or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each
of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to
commence any such Action except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in
respect of any such Action may be heard and determined in such state courts
or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such federal court, (iii) waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and

   

effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the

such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in Section 11.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

(c)EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT FINANCING
AND ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM THAT
INVOLVES ANY FINANCING SOURCE). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT

EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
11.04(c).

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and without limiting the
following sentence, each Party agrees (i) that any action of any kind or
nature, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, against a
Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be brought exclusively in
the Supreme Court of the State of New York in the County of New York or, if
under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts,
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts there) in the County of New York, and each Party submits for
itself and its property with respect to any such action to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts, (ii) that service of process, summons, notice or
document by registered mail addressed to it at its address provided in Section
11.01 shall be effective service of process against it for any such action
brought in any such court, (iii) to waive and hereby irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such Action in any such court, (iv) that a
final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by

Section 11.04(c) as such Section is in effect on the date hereof. 

   

Section 11.05. Assignment; Successors and Assigns; No Third Party
Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement may not,
without the prior written consent of the other Parties, be assigned by
operation of Law or otherwise, and any attempted assignment shall be null and
void; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall, at
any time and without the prior written consent of any other Party, have the
right to assign all or a part of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates and, in the case of its rights
under this Agreement, to one or more Financing Sources as collateral security
(provided, that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of
its obligations under this Agreement). Subject to the foregoing, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and
their respective heirs, successors, permitted assigns and legal
representatives. No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any
rights, benefits, remedies or Liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than
the Parties and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however,
that (a) the Financing Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of
and have the right to enforce Sections 10.02, 11.02(c), 11.04(c), 11.04(d) and
this Section 11.05, (b) the Indemnified Parties shall be express third party
beneficiaries of and have the right to enforce Article IX, (c) the DandO
Indemnitees shall be express third party beneficiaries of and have the right
to enforce Section 5.17, and (d) Holdings shall be an express third party
beneficiary of and have the right to enforce Section 10.02(c) and 10.02(d).

 

Section 11.06. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by all of the other Parties. Until and unless each
Party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other Parties, this
Agreement shall have no effect and no Party shall have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF or other equivalent format or by
facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement.

 

Section 11.07. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the Exhibits and
Schedules attached thereto, the Transaction Documents and the Parent Backstop
constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the matters
covered hereby and supersedes all previous written, oral or implied
understandings among them with respect to such matters.

 

Section 11.08. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

Section 11.09. Specific Performance.

   

(a)The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that any breach of this
Agreement would not be adequately compensated by monetary damages. Except as
otherwise set forth in this Section 11.09, including the limitations set forth
herein, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, prior to the valid termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01, Buyer, on the one hand, and
Parent and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall, in the event of any breach
or threatened breach by Parent and the Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on
the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement, be entitled to equitable relief, including an injunction or
injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement, by the other, as applicable, and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and agreements of the other
under this Agreement. The Parties hereto have specifically bargained for the
right to specific performance of the obligations hereunder, in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Section 11.09, notwithstanding the potential
for payment of the Termination Fee in the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 10.02.

 

(b)Each Party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of
the equitable remedy of specific performance when available pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by
such Party, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and agreements of such Party under this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.09. Any Party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such
order or injunction, all in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.09.
Each Party further agrees that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in
this Section 11.09, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek
any other form of relief that may be available to such party under this
Agreement or the Parent Backstop in the event that this Agreement has been
terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this Section
11.09 are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set
forth in this Section 11.09 shall require any Party to institute any Action
for (or limit any Party's right to institute any Action for) specific
performance under this Section 11.09 prior or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under Article X, nor shall the commencement of any Action
pursuant to this Section 11.09 or anything set forth in this Section 11.09
restrict or limit any Party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of Article X or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement
or the Parent Backstop that may be available then or thereafter.

 

Section 11.10. Disclosure Schedules. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
(a) the inclusion of any items or information in the Disclosure Schedules that
are not required by this Agreement to be so included is solely for the
convenience of Buyer, (b) the disclosure by Parent or the Sellers of any
matter in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an
acknowledgement by Parent or the Sellers that the matter is required to be
disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material or
significant, (c) if any section of the Disclosure Schedules lists an item or
information in such a way as to make its relevance to the disclosure required
by or provided in another section of the Disclosure Schedules or the
statements contained in any Section of this Agreement reasonably apparent on
its face, the matter shall be

   

deemed to have been disclosed in or with respect to such other section of the
Disclosure Schedules, notwithstanding the omission of an appropriate cross-
reference to such other section or the omission of a reference in the
particular representation and warranty to such section of the Disclosure
Schedules, (d) headings have been inserted in the Disclosure Schedules for
convenience of reference only and (e) the Disclosure Schedules are qualified
in their entirety by reference to specific provisions of this Agreement.

 

Section 11.11.Retention of Counsel. Each of the parties to this Agreement
acknowledges that Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP ("Fried Frank")
currently serves as counsel to both (a) the Business Entities and (b) Parent
and the Sellers in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. There may
come a time, including after consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, when the interests of
Parent and the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Business Entities, on the
other hand, may no longer be aligned or when, for any reason, Parent, the
Sellers, Fried Frank or any of the Business Entities believes that Fried Frank
can or should no longer represent both Parent and the Sellers and the Business
Entities. The parties understand and specifically agree that Fried Frank may
withdraw from representing the Business Entities and continue to represent
Parent and the Sellers, even if the interests of Parent and the Sellers and
the interests of the Business Entities are or may be adverse, including in
connection with any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, and even though Fried Frank may have represented the Business
Entities in a matter substantially related to such dispute or may be handling
ongoing matters for the Business Entities or any of their Affiliates, and
Buyer hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising
therefrom. Buyer, for itself and the Business Entities, and for Buyer's and
the Business Entities' respective successors and assigns, irrevocably
acknowledges and agrees that all communications between Parent and the
Sellers, on the one hand, and counsel, on the other hand, including, without
limitation, Fried Frank, made in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution, delivery and closing under, or any dispute or Action arising under
or in connection with, this Agreement which, immediately prior to the Closing,
would be deemed to be privileged communications of Parent, the Sellers and/or
any of their respective Subsidiaries (including the Business Entities) and
their counsel and would not be subject to disclosure to Buyer in connection
with any process relating to a dispute arising under or in connection with
this Agreement or otherwise, shall continue after the Closing to be privileged
communications between Parent, the Sellers and such counsel and neither Buyer
nor any Person acting or purporting to act on behalf of or through Buyer shall
seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that the privilege
attaching to such communications belongs to the Business Entities and not
Parent or the Sellers. Buyer and the Business Entities agree that any
attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection, and expectation
of client confidence arising from or as a result of counsel's representation
of an Business Entity, Seller or Parent prior to the Closing, and all
information and documents covered by such privilege or protection, shall
belong to and be controlled by Parent and may be waived only by the Parent,
and not a Business Entity, and shall not pass to or be claimed or used by
Buyer or any Business Entity, except with respect to the assertion of such
privilege or protection against a third party.

 

Section 11.12. Holdings Guaranty. As an inducement to Parent and the Sellers
to enter into this Agreement, Holdings agrees to guarantee, and does hereby
absolutely and

   

unconditionally guarantee, the full and prompt performance of all of the
covenants, agreements and obligations of Buyer under this Agreement.
