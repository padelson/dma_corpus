(as so adjusted, the " _Purchase Price_ ").

(b) The Purchase Price will be:

2.2(a)(ii)_, solely with respect to any breach of _Section_ __ _ 4.4(g)_, in
which event Seller may not waive such condition, and Purchaser shall not be
obligated to consummate the Closing, prior to the Termination Date) of all
conditions to the obligations of the parties set forth in _Article II_ (other
than (x) the Reorganization, which may be consummated in all material
respects, as of the date immediately prior to the Closing Date and (y) such
conditions as may, by their terms, only be satisfied at the Closing or on the
Closing Date); or (ii) at such other place or on such other date as the
parties may mutually agree in writing. The parties hereto agree that the
Closing may be effected remotely by means of the delivery and exchange of this
Agreement and the other documents and instruments and signatures required to
be delivered by each party hereunder by electronic mail (as portable document
format (PDF) files), facsimile transmission, hand delivery, or such other
means as the parties hereto mutually agree, and wire transfer of funds. The
day on which the Closing takes place is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."
Solely for purposes of determining the Effective Time and as reasonably
necessary for purposes of the recording of any document or the giving of any
notice of the Transactions to any Governmental Entity, the Closing will be
deemed to have taken place at

 



3  12:01 a.m. local time on the Closing Date in each applicable jurisdiction
where an Acquired Company is located; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) all
actions to be taken and all documents to be executed and delivered by the
parties at the Closing shall be deemed to have been taken, executed and
delivered simultaneously as of the Closing, and (2) the transfer of ownership
of the Purchased Assets and assignment and assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities hereunder shall be effective for all purposes as of the Closing.

 

(b) Purchaser will acquire and accept the NN International Interests from
Seller through the execution of a Deed of Transfer. Seller shall cause NN
International to acknowledge the transfer of the NN International Interests on
the Closing Date by co-signing the Deed of Transfer and by immediately
entering such transfer in its register of shareholders.

(c) At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller will
prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement setting forth Sellers good
faith estimate of each item set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.2(b)_ based on the
Carve-Out Accounting Principles, including with respect to the Closing Cash,
broken down by the amount of the Closing Cash held by each Acquired Company,
together with supporting documentation and work papers describing in
reasonable detail how such estimates were derived, and Seller
shall reasonably consider revising any estimated item to which Purchaser has
provided comments to Seller (the " _Closing Statement_ "). The consideration
to be paid at the Closing by Purchaser, pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.3(e)_
will be as set forth in the Closing Statement (the " _Estimated Purchase
Price_ ").

 

(d) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing:

 

(i) Seller will, or will cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver to the Notary
the original shareholders register of NN International which reflects Seller
as the owner of the NN International Interests and that the NN International
Interests are free and clear of all Encumbrances;

 

(ii) Seller will deliver to the Notary (with copies to Purchaser) powers of
attorney duly executed on behalf of Seller and NN International,
respectively, and, to the extent required by the Notary, legalized and
apostilled, and Purchaser will deliver to the Notary (with a copy to Seller) a
power of attorney duly executed on behalf of Purchaser and, to the
extent required by the Notary, legalized and apostilled, in each case for the
execution of the Deed of Transfer; and

 

(iii) Seller and Purchaser will deliver to the Notary a confirmation
statement with respect to the authority of the representative signing the
power of attorney as referred to in _Section_ __ _ 1.3(d)(ii)_, on behalf of
Seller and Purchaser, respectively.

 

(e) At the Closing, in consideration for the transfer of the Closing
Acquired Interests, Purchaser (or one or more Purchaser Designees) will pay
in cash by one (1) or more wire transfers of immediately available funds an
aggregate amount equal to the Estimated Purchase Price to an account to be
specified in a written notice delivered by Seller to Purchaser at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing (the " _Seller Account_ ").

 

(f) _Withholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or
cause to be deducted and withheld) from any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, such
amounts as it may be required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any
applicable provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , in the case of any withholding with respect to the Purchase

 



4  Price, the Person intending to withhold from any such consideration shall
notify Seller in writing of its intention to withhold and deduct such amounts
and the basis for such withholding at least five (5) Business Days prior to
the date the applicable payment is to be made. To the extent that any amounts
are so deducted or withheld by Purchaser and paid over to the applicable
Taxing Authority, the deducted or withheld amounts will be treated for all

Purchaser shall give Seller reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Initial Allocation Statement; _provided_ , that Sellers failure to

the Independent Accountant for resolution, and the decision of the
Independent Accountant shall be final and binding on the parties. The costs of

a position on any Tax Return or in any audit or examination before any
Governmental Entity that is inconsistent with the Final Allocation Statement
(as adjusted), except to the extent required by applicable Law or a
Governmental Entity.

 

Section 1.6 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but in any event within

Seller a statement based on the Carve-Out Accounting Principles (the " _Post-
Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail
Purchasers calculation of (i) the Closing Net Working Capital and the NWC
Adjustment, (ii) the Closing Cash, (iii) the Closing Indebtedness, (iv) the
Acquired Companies Transaction Expenses and (v) the proposed Final Purchase
Price. 

 



6 (b) Seller may, within forty-five (45) days after delivery of the Post-
Closing Statement (the " _Seller Notice Period_ "), deliver a notice to
Purchaser disagreeing with specific items in the Post-Closing Statement and
setting forth in reasonable detail Sellers calculation of (i) the Closing
Net Working Capital and the NWC Adjustment, (ii) the Closing Cash, (iii) the
Closing Indebtedness and (iv) the Acquired Companies Transaction Expenses,
together with supporting documentation and work papers describing
in reasonable detail how such specific items were derived (the " _Notice of
Disagreement_ "). If Seller does not deliver the Notice of Disagreement within
the Seller Notice Period, then Seller will be deemed to have agreed to
the Post-Closing Statement and the computation of the Purchase Price set
forth therein will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties for all
purposes hereunder. If Seller delivers the Notice of Disagreement within the
Seller Notice Period, Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with all amounts
and items contained or reflected in the Post-Closing Statement to the extent
such amounts or items are not disputed in the Notice of Disagreement and all
such undisputed amounts will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties
for all purposes hereunder.

(c) If Seller delivers the Notice of Disagreement within the Seller Notice
Period, Purchaser and Seller, during the thirty (30) days following such
delivery, will cooperate and discuss in good faith to reach agreement on the
disputed items or amounts in order to determine the Final Purchase Price. If
the parties so resolve all disputes, the computation of the Purchase Price
agreed upon by the parties, will be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties for all purposes hereunder.

 

(d) If Seller delivers a Notice of Disagreement within the Seller Notice
Period, and Purchaser and Seller are unable to reach an agreement on the
disputed items or amounts within the period described in _Section_ __ _
1.6(c)_, the parties will engage Deloitte or another mutually agreed
independent accountant to be agreed upon by Purchaser and Seller (the "
_Independent Accountant_ "), to review this Agreement and the disputed items
or amounts for the purpose of calculating the Final Purchase Price (it being
understood that, in making such calculation, the Independent Accountant will
function as an expert and not as an arbitrator). In making its calculation of
the Final Purchase Price, the Independent Accountant (i) will apply the
accounting and related standards contemplated in this Agreement including the
definitions of "Closing Net Working Capital," "NWC Adjustment," "Closing
Cash," "Closing Indebtedness" and "Acquired Companies Transaction Expenses" in
this Agreement, (ii) will consider only those items or amounts in the Post-
Closing Statement as to which Seller identifies in the Notice of Disagreement
and (iii) will not assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the
greatest value for such item assigned by Purchaser or Seller or less than the
smallest value for such item assigned by Purchaser or Seller in the Post-
Closing Statement or the Notice of Disagreement, as applicable. The
Independent Accountant will deliver to Purchaser and Seller, as promptly as
practicable (but in any event within thirty (30) days after the date of
engagement of the Independent Accountant), a report setting forth its
calculation of the Final Purchase Price. The Independent Accountants
calculation of the Final Purchase Price will be final, conclusive and binding
on the parties for all purposes hereunder. Subject to the following sentence,
the costs of any dispute resolution pursuant to this subsection, including the
fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant and of any enforcement of the
determination thereof, shall be borne by Purchaser and Seller in inverse
proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the Independent
Accountant, which

 



7  proportionate allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on
the relative Dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be determined
by the Independent Accountant at the time the determination of such firm is
rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the fees and disbursements of the Representatives of each party
incurred in connection with their preparation or review of the Post-Closing
Statement and preparation or review of any Notice of Disagreement, as
applicable, shall be borne by such party.

 

(e) The final, conclusive and binding Purchase Price as determined in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)_, _(c)_ and _(d)_ , will be referred
to as the " _Final Purchase Price_."

 

(f) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase
Price, Purchaser (or one or more Purchaser Designees) will promptly, and in
no event later than five (5) Business Days after determination of the Final
Purchase Price in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, pay to Seller an
aggregate amount equal to the Final Purchase Price less the Estimated
Purchase Price, by one (1) or more wire transfers of immediately available
funds to the Seller Account. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, such payment shall be made directly from Purchaser to
Seller.

(g) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price,
Seller will promptly, and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after
determination of the Final Purchase Price in accordance with this _Section_ __
_ 1.6_, pay to Purchaser (or one or more Purchaser Designees) an aggregate
amount equal to the Estimated Purchase Price less the Final Purchase Price,
by one (1) or more wire transfers of immediately available funds to an account
specified by Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained

promptly as practicable to Purchaser and its Representatives complete and
correct copies of Books and Records, Contracts, financial and operating data
and other information that are in the possession of Seller or its Subsidiary
relating to, or necessary for the operation of, the Acquired Business, and
(iii) instruct the Acquired Company Employees and their respective
Representatives to reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and its Representatives

(b) Each of the parties hereto will hold, and will cause its
Representatives to hold, in confidence all documents and information

Section 5.9 _Notification; Updated Seller Disclosure Schedule_.

 

(a) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, each party will give prompt
notice to the other parties of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, after the date hereof, would
cause a breach of any representation or warranty of such party contained
herein as of the Closing such that the condition set forth in _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_ would not be satisfied and (ii) any failure
of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by such party hereunder such that the
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_
would not be satisfied;  _provided_ , that no information provided pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ shall limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice, or the representations
and warranties of, or the conditions to the obligations of, each party.

(b) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing (as
contemplated to occur in _Section_ __ _ 1.3_), Seller shall, if applicable,
update and supplement in good faith the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Updated Seller Disclosure Schedule_ "), and deliver the Updated Seller
Disclosure Schedule to Purchaser, with respect to any matter not existing or,
to the extent that a representation or warranty is qualified by a reference to
Knowledge of Seller, not Known by Seller as of the date of this
Agreement, which, if existing

 



35  or Known by Seller as of the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to be set forth or described in the Seller Disclosure Schedule. The
Updated Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to have amended and
supplemented the Seller Disclosure Schedule and to have further qualified the
representations and warranties made in this Agreement solely for the purposes
of determining whether the conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)(ii)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(iii)_ have been satisfied as of the
Closing, except where without such additional qualification by the Updated
Seller Disclosure Schedule delivered in accordance with this paragraph, (i)
with respect _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_, the failure of such representation
or warranty to be true and correct, would or would reasonably be likely to,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect, or
(ii) with respect to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(iii)_, such representation or
warranty would not, or would not reasonably likely to, be true and correct in
all material respects. For the avoidance of doubt, the Updated Seller
Disclosure Schedule shall have no effect on whether any other conditions set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ have been satisfied. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, except as expressly set forth in this _Section_ __ _
5.9_, the Updated Seller Disclosure Schedule, if any, shall not limit, qualify
or serve as an exception to, in any way any of the representations and
warranties made by Seller pursuant to  _Article III_ for the purpose of
limiting Purchasers rights to indemnification pursuant to _Article VII_ in
respect thereof.

 

(c) Seller shall provide written notice to Purchaser, together with
reasonable details, promptly after (i) commencing any material Action related
to the Acquired Business or (ii) terminating with or without cause any key
personnel of the Acquired Business as set forth on the "PBC Group Org
Structure" made available to Purchaser. 

(d) Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a CD-ROM or other electronic
media containing all materials posted to the virtual data room managed by

Closing) promptly, and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days,
after the Closing Date.

 

Section 5.10 _Financing_.

 

(a) Purchaser has arranged and obtained fully committed and underwritten

proceeds of the Acquisition Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Acquisition Financing Commitment Letters, including to (i) maintain in
effect the Acquisition Financing and the Acquisition Financing Commitments
Letters, (ii) enter into definitive financing agreements with respect to the
Acquisition Financing on the terms and conditions specified in the Acquisition
Financing Commitment Letters, so that such agreements are in effect
as promptly as practicable but in any event no later than the Closing and
(iii) consummate the Acquisition Financing at or prior to the Closing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Closing, Purchaser
shall give Seller prompt notice (A) of any breach or default by any party to
any Acquisition Financing Commitment Letters or definitive document related to
the Acquisition Financing of which Purchaser becomes aware; (B) of the receipt
of any notice or other communication from any financing source with respect
to any: (x) breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any
Acquisition Financing Commitment Letters or any definitive document related to
the Acquisition Financing of any provisions of the Acquisition Financing
Commitment Letters or any definitive document related to the Acquisition
Financing or (y) formal dispute between or among any parties to, or
disagreement between or among any parties other than disagreements in
connection with ordinary course negotiations regarding the terms and
conditions of, any Acquisition

 



36  Financing Commitment Letters or any definitive documents related to the
Acquisition Financing; and (C) if for any reason Purchaser believes in good
faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Acquisition Financing that Purchaser requests on the terms, in the manner or
from the sources contemplated by the Acquisition Financing Commitment Letters
or the definitive documents relating to the Acquisition Financing. As soon as
reasonably practicable following Sellers written request, Purchaser shall
provide any information reasonably requested by Seller relating to any
circumstances referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the immediately
preceding sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, the Closing is not
conditioned upon Purchasers ability to obtain financing.

 

(b) From the date hereof until the Closing, Seller shall provide to
Purchaser, and shall cause the Acquired Companies and its and their
respective officers, employees and other Representatives to provide to
Purchaser, at Purchasers cost and expense for all out-of-pocket
reasonable costs and expenses incurred, all commercially reasonable
cooperation requested by Purchaser in connection with the Acquisition
Financing, including: (i) assisting with the preparation of any pledge and
security documents, guarantee and other definitive financing documents and
the delivery of other certificates, legal opinions and similar documents as
may be commercially reasonably requested by Purchaser; (ii) facilitating the
pledging of collateral; and (iii) taking all corporate or entity actions
reasonably requested by Purchaser to permit the consummation of the
Acquisition Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available
to Purchaser at the Closing. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates, and each of their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents and other Representatives from and against any and
all Liabilities suffered or incurred in connection with providing any
commercially reasonable cooperation requested by Purchaser pursuant to the
foregoing sentence; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
apply in the event of Sellers or its Affiliates or other Representatives
willful misconduct or gross negligence. For purposes of further clarity,
regarding the immediately preceding sentence, in the event of Sellers willful
misconduct or gross negligence, Purchaser shall be entitled to all available
rights and remedies under this Agreement or at law or in equity.

Section 5.11 _Resignations_. Provided the resignation requests from
Purchaser do not require Seller to breach any contract or violate Law, __
Seller shall have delivered to Purchaser resignations effective as of the
Closing of each manager, director and officer of each Acquired Company to the
extent such resignations are requested by Purchaser five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing, and if any such resignation cannot be obtained by
Seller, Seller shall make commercially reasonable efforts to terminate
or otherwise dismiss such manager, director and officer of such Acquired
Company, including the adoption of shareholder resolutions for NN
International granting one or more directors full and final discharge and
appoint one (1) or more new directors, in each case effective as of the

Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies) to, repay in cash and
otherwise discharge in full: (a) any and all Indebtedness by and between
Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired Companies) and the
Acquired Companies and (b) any and all Accounts Receivable and Accounts
Payable by and between Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired
Companies) and the Acquired Companies. For the avoidance of doubt, any of the

Accounts Payable by and between the Acquired Companies.

date hereof and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement and the Closing, Seller may (i) accelerate the vesting of any
benefits (including equity awards) provided to any Acquired Company Employee
or director, officer or consultant who will transfer to an Acquired Company as
part of the Reorganization, or (ii) grant any retention, severance or
termination pay to any Acquired Company Employee who will transfer to
an Acquired Company as part of the Reorganization, in each case at Sellers
sole cost and expense (and not for the account of the Acquired Business);

(a) Purchaser is not obtaining pursuant to this Agreement or any
Transaction Document any rights with respect to any Seller-Retained
Trademarks, except for the limited license during the Phase-Out Period as
expressly set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_. After the Closing,
Purchaser will cause each Acquired Companys Organizational Documents to be
amended to change such Acquired Companys name such that it does not contain
any Seller-Retained Trademark, and Purchaser will, or will cause the Acquired
Companies to, execute and deliver to the applicable Governmental Entity all
necessary documentation and materials to effectuate such name change.
Purchaser will, during the twelve (12) months following the Closing (such
period, the " _Phase-Out Period_"), (i) cease to apply or use the Seller-
Retained Trademarks for or on any Company Offerings and associated signage,
websites, advertisements, marketing brochures, purchase orders, invoices,
sales orders, labels, letterhead, business cards, employee and customer
communications, packaging, shipping documents and other materials; and (ii)
cease to use, manufacture, market, sell, license, distribute, or otherwise

_Schedule C_ in the operation of the Acquired Companies during the Phase-Out
Period solely to the extent reasonably necessary to sell, market, distribute,
service, and/or otherwise dispose of any Company Offerings transferred at
Closing that bear a Seller-Retained Trademark, and, in connection therewith,
to use existing stocks of packaging, promotional materials, and other
documents and materials that bear a Seller-Retained Trademark. Such use must
materially comply with Sellers applicable trademark usage guidelines (a copy
of which has been made available to Purchaser). Purchaser will not (and will
ensure that its Affiliates, including the Acquired Companies, do not) (w)
register or attempt to register any Seller-Retained Trademark; (x) challenge
the validity, or Sellers or its Affiliates use, of any Seller-Retained
Trademark; (y) modify any Seller-Retained Trademark; or (z) use or display any
Seller-Retained Trademark except as expressly permitted under _Schedule_ __ _
C_ and this  _Section_ __ _ 6.5_. All use of the Seller-Retained Trademarks

benefit of Seller.

or third party confidentiality obligation, including _Section_ __ _ 9.10_
hereof), with copies, or if required by applicable Law, originals, of those
records and documents in Sellers possession related to the Acquired Business
or any Acquired Company (to the extent not included in the Books and Records
of the Acquired Companies or otherwise not transferred to the Acquired
Companies) as may be reasonably necessary for (i) Purchasers operation of the
Acquired Business after the Closing or (ii) litigation, preparation of
financial statements, tax returns and audits or other valid business purpose.

 



42 (b) Purchaser shall provide to Seller and its Representatives, at Sellers
reasonable request (subject to applicable Law and any limitations that are
reasonably required to preserve any applicable privilege or third party
confidentiality obligation), with copies, or, if required by applicable Law,
originals, of those records and documents covering any period prior to the
Closing related to the Acquired Business or the Acquired Companies as may be
reasonably necessary for litigation, preparation of financial statements, tax
returns and audits or other valid business purpose.

If so requested by either Seller or Purchaser, the other party shall enter
into a customary joint defense agreement with Seller or Purchaser with
respect to any information to be provided to such party pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _  6.6_.

Section 6.7 _Non-Solicit; Non-Competition_.

(a) Without obtaining Purchasers prior written consent, for a period of
three (3) years after the Closing, Seller will not directly or indirectly
solicit for employment or hire any employee of the Acquired Business.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude Seller from (i)
engaging in general solicitations of employment by means of general
advertisements or through a professional recruiter who was not instructed to
target any employee of the Acquired Business, or (ii) hiring any former
employee of the Acquired Business that has been (x) terminated by Purchaser
or its Affiliate following the Closing, or (y) that has not been an employee
of the Acquired Business for a period of nine (9) months. Without obtaining
Sellers prior written consent, for a period of three (3) years after the
Closing, Purchaser will not directly or indirectly solicit for employment or
hire any employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries (other than an Acquired
Company) who Purchaser directly or indirectly came into contact with or is
otherwise aware of, in each case by virtue of this Transaction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall preclude Purchaser from
(A) engaging in general solicitations of employment by means of general
advertisements or through a professional recruiter who was not instructed to
target any employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries, or (B) hiring any former
employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries that has been (x) terminated by
Seller or its Subsidiaries following the Closing, or (y) that has not been an
employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries for a period of nine (9) months.

 

(b) During the three (3) year period following the Closing, Seller shall
not and shall cause its Subsidiaries to not, as an agent, consultant,
principal, Representative, equity holder, manager, member, advisor,
independent contractor, general partner, officer, director, stockholder,
investor, lender or guarantor of any corporation, partnership or other
entity, or in any other capacity, directly or indirectly, individually or
otherwise: (i) provide services or sell products that directly compete with
any Company Offering used in the same operational application, which is radial
ball bearings, cv joints, radial cylindrical bearings and tapered roller
bearings (a " _Competitive Product_ "); (ii) own any equity interest in,
manage or operate any Person that manufactures or sells any Competitive
Product, or that has been formed for the purpose of pursuing a business that
manufactures or sells any Competitive Product; or (iii) promote or assist, as
a lender, guarantor or any similar capacity, any Person that manufactures or
sells any Competitive Product. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein
shall restrict Seller (A) from operating the Plastic Cages Business, (B) from
engaging in any business other than the Acquired Business that Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries 

 



43  engages in as of the date of this Agreement; or (C) holding not more than
five percent (5%) of the outstanding voting securities of any publicly listed
company that is primarily engaged in the manufacturing and sale of a
Competitive Product, provided Seller or such Affiliate does not control,
directly or indirectly, or otherwise have the right to designate any person to
the board of directors (or other equivalent body) of such company.

(c) Seller acknowledges that the knowledge and goodwill associated with the
acquisition of the Purchased Assets and the Acquired Business is an integral
component of the value that is being acquired by Purchaser and is reflected in
the consideration payable to Seller in connection with the Transactions.
Seller acknowledges that the promises and the restrictions that Seller is
providing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ are reasonable and necessary to protect
Purchasers legitimate interest in its acquisition of the Purchased Assets and
the Acquired Business pursuant to this Agreement. Seller also acknowledges
that the limitations of time, geography and scope of activity agreed to in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ are reasonable because, among other things: (i)
Purchaser and Seller are engaged in a highly competitive industry; (ii)
Seller and each of its Subsidiaries has had unique access to the Trade
Secrets, confidential information and know-how of the Acquired Business; and
(iii) this  _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ provides no more protection than is
necessary to protect Purchasers interests in its acquisition of the Purchased
Assets and the Acquired Business, including the goodwill, and Trade Secrets
associated therewith.

(d) Purchaser and Seller acknowledge that any violation of this _Section_
__ _ 6.7_ may result in an irreparable injury to the Purchaser or Seller,
respectively, and that damages at law may not be reasonable or adequate
compensation to the Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, for violation of
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ and that, in addition to any other available
remedies, Purchaser and Seller shall be entitled to have the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ specifically enforced by preliminary and permanent
injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a
bond or other security to an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits and
other benefits arising out of any violation of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.7_.

Section 6.8 _Employees_. Purchaser will review and evaluate each Acquired
Company Employee for continued employment opportunities with the Acquired
Companies and/or Purchaser following the Closing whether in connection with
the Acquired Business or otherwise. Purchaser agrees that for a period of
twelve (12) months following the Closing, it shall provide, or shall cause its
Affiliates to provide, each Acquired Company Employee who continues to be
employed by Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Acquired Companies with (i) an
annual base salary or wage rate that is the same as or greater than his or her
annual base salary or wage rate in effect immediately prior to the Closing,
(ii) annual cash incentive compensation opportunities that are substantially
similar in the aggregate as compared to his or her ordinary course target
annual cash incentive compensation opportunities in effect immediately prior
to the Closing, it being understood that such annual incentive compensation
need not be provided by Purchaser to such employees in the form of equity or
equity-based awards and that Purchaser will have discretion to determine the
relevant performance goals, and (iii) health and medical benefits that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by Seller to such
employee immediately prior to the Closing, and such other employee benefits
that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided by Seller to
such employee, immediately prior to the Closing, including, with respect to
any continuing Acquired Company Employee that is a party to a severance
agreement, health and medical benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than, and such other severance benefits that are substantially
similar in the aggregate to, the health and

 



44  medical and/or other severance benefits, as applicable, provided in such
severance agreement. Purchaser, in its sole discretion, may elect to provide
that any continuing employment relationships shall remain or become
terminable by Purchaser or the applicable Acquired Company Employee. Purchaser
will be solely responsible for all termination and severance benefits, costs,
charges and liabilities of any nature incurred with respect to
the termination or the modification of any employment arrangement of an
Acquired Company Employee on or after the Closing, including any claims
arising out of or relating to any plant closing, mass layoff, or similar event
under Law occurring on or after the Closing.

Section 6.9 _Insurance_. Where any occurrence-based insurance policy of
Seller or its Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired Companies) in effect prior
to the Closing (each, a " _Designated Insurance Policy_ ") provides coverage
for any Liabilities of the Acquired Business arising out of claims made after
the Closing with respect to an occurrence prior to the Closing (collectively,
" _Covered Claims_ "), to the extent permitted under such Designated Insurance
Policy, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries may submit a Covered Claim under such
Designated Insurance Policy, control the prosecution and defense of such
Covered Claim, and receive any insurance proceeds with respect thereto,
subject to the other provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_. After the
Closing, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall administer the Designated Insurance
Policies in their sole discretion; provided, that Seller shall not and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, in connection with such administration,
knowingly limit, inhibit or preclude the right of Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries to insurance coverage thereunder in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 6.9_, in each case, with respect to Covered Claims, in a
manner disproportionately adverse to Purchaser and its Subsidiaries relative
to Seller and its Subsidiaries. Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of any
Covered Claims, and Seller agrees to reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries concerning the pursuit by Purchaser and its Subsidiaries for
coverage of any such Covered Claims under any applicable Designated Insurance
Policy, in each case, at the expense of Purchaser (to the extent such expenses
are not covered by the applicable Designated Insurance Policies). Purchaser
shall be responsible for complying with terms of the applicable Designated
Insurance Policies in respect of such Covered Claims, including if the
applicable Designated Insurance Policy requires any payments to be made in
connection therewith (including satisfying any applicable deductible or self-
insured retention under the Designated Insurance Policies in respect of such
Covered Claims), and Purchaser shall make or cause to be made any such
required payments. Any amounts received by Seller or its Subsidiaries under a
Designated Insurance Policy, to the extent that those amounts relate to
Covered Claims submitted by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, shall be paid (net
of any costs of recovery incurred by Seller or its Subsidiaries) promptly to
Purchaser, subject to the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_. In the
event that Covered Claims submitted by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries relate to
the same occurrence for which Seller or its Subsidiaries are seeking coverage
under a Designated Insurance Policy, (a) Seller and Purchaser shall bear any
expenses in connection therewith in proportion to the amounts of their
respective claims (to the extent such expenses are not covered by such
Designated Insurance Policy) and (b) in the event that policy limits under
such Designated Insurance Policy are exhausted by the payment of any amounts
due in respect of such occurrence, such amounts shall be paid to the
respective parties proportionately to the amount due to each such party or
its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 6.10 _NN_ _d.o.o. Kon_ _ji_ _c_. If at Closing, Seller does not
own the Minority Bosnia Interests, Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for up to
 90,000 (Ninety Thousand Euros), in the aggregate, of costs and expenses it
or any of its Subsidiaries reasonably incurred to acquire the Minority Bosnia
Interests, in one or more transactions, as the case may be, in accordance with
applicable Law.

TO AN UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTY WITH RESPECT THERETO.

 



48 Section 7.3 _Notice of Claim; Defense_.

(a) If (i) any third party or Governmental Entity institutes, threatens or
asserts any Action that may reasonably give rise to Losses for which a party
(an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") may be liable for indemnification under this
_Article VII_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") or (ii) any Person entitled
to indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") will
have a claim to be indemnified by an Indemnifying Party that does not involve
a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), then the Indemnified Party will
promptly send to the Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying (to the
extent known) the nature of such claim and the amount of all related Losses
(to the extent known) (a " _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
any failure to give such Claim Notice or to provide any such facts or amounts
will not affect the rights of the Indemnified Party except to the extent that
such failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party. Each Claim Notice
shall (i)(A) specify in reasonable detail all relevant facts, conditions and
events, and (B) identify the specific provisions of this Agreement which give
rise to such indemnification right; and (ii) include a good-faith estimate of
the amount of Losses for which the Indemnified Party is seeking
indemnification from the Indemnifying Party.

(b) In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may elect
to retain counsel of its choice, reasonably acceptable to the relevant
Indemnified Parties, to represent such Indemnified Parties in connection with
such Action and will pay the fees, charges and disbursements of such counsel.
Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Parties may participate, at their own expense and
through legal counsel of their choice, in any such Action;  _provided_ , that
(i) subject to the preceding sentence, the Indemnifying Party may elect to
control the defense of the Indemnified Parties in connection with such Action,
and (ii) the Indemnified Parties and their counsel will cooperate with the
Indemnifying Partys counsel in connection with such Action. The Indemnifying
Party will have the right to settle, compromise or discharge a Third Party
Claim either (A) subject to the prior written consent of the applicable
Indemnified Party, such consent to be given in its sole discretion, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, or (B) without any Indemnified
Partys consent if such settlement, compromise or discharge provides for no
relief other than the payment of monetary damages and such monetary damages
are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and requires no admission of
Liability by any Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall not assume the control of the defense of any Third
Party Claim if (1) such Third Party Claim may reasonably result in injunctions
or other equitable remedies in respect of the Indemnified Party or its
business, (2) both the Indemnifying Party and any Indemnified Party are
parties to or subjects of such Third Party Claim (including any impleaded
parties) and conflicts of interests exist between the Indemnifying Party and
such Indemnified Party, (3) such Third Party Claim may reasonably result in
criminal proceedings in respect of the Indemnified Party or its business, (4)
would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the
business or financial condition of the Indemnified Party after the Closing,
(5) upon petition by the Indemnified Party, if an appropriate court rules that
the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend
such Third Party Claim, in which event the Indemnified Party (at
the Indemnifying Partys cost and expense) shall assume the defense with
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, or (6) such Third
Party Claim is with respect to Taxes related to the Acquired Companies for
periods beginning after the Closing Date or (7) if Purchaser is the
Indemnified Party, such Third Party Claim may reasonably be expected to result
in Losses in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the amount

 



49  Purchaser would be entitled to receive indemnification from Seller pursuant
to this _Article VII_. If the Indemnifying Party (x) elects not to retain
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the relevant Indemnified Parties and
assume control of such defense within twenty (20) days of receiving a Claim
Notice or (y) pursuant to the terms of the foregoing sentence, is otherwise
not allowed to control the defense of such Third Party Claim, then the
Indemnified Parties will retain counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party in connection with such Third Party Claim and assume
control of the defense of the Indemnified Parties in connection with such
Third Party Claim, and the fees, charges and disbursements of such counsel
selected by the Indemnified Parties will be payable by the Indemnifying
Parties. Whether the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party controls the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the parties hereto will cooperate in the
defense thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)_.

 

(c) From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice, at the reasonable
request of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party will, at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, afford the Indemnifying Party and its employees,
counsel, experts and representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to the books, records, personnel and properties of the Indemnified
Party to the extent reasonably necessary to investigate the Claim Notice.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Indemnified Party will have any obligation
to make available to the Indemnifying Party any information if making such
information available would (i) jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, or
(ii) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
(including any confidentiality agreement to which the Indemnified Party is a
party) (it being understood that Indemnified Party will cooperate in any
reasonable efforts and requests for waivers or other mechanisms that would
enable otherwise required disclosure to the Indemnifying Party to occur
without contravening such Law, duty or agreement or jeopardizing any
attorney-client privilege).

(d) In the event of a Direct Claim, within thirty (30) calendar days of
delivery of a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution
of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations within such thirty
(30) day period, such dispute will be resolved in accordance with to _Section_
__ _ 9.4_. In the event of a Direct Claim made by a Purchaser Indemnitee
against Seller, if the Purchaser Indemnitee and Seller reach an agreement to
resolve such dispute, a memorandum setting forth such agreement will be
prepared and signed by all applicable parties. In the event a dispute between
a Purchaser Indemnitee and Seller results in arbitration pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 9.4_, the decision of the arbitrators with respect to such
dispute will be final, binding and conclusive upon the parties thereto.

 

Section 7.4 _Adjustments to Losses_.

 

(a) _Insurance_. The amount of any Losses for which an Indemnified Party
claims indemnification under this Agreement shall be reduced by (i) any
available insurance proceeds actually recovered with respect to such Losses
and (ii) any other amounts recovered from a third party pursuant to
indemnification or otherwise in respect of such Losses, in each case, net of
out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party
in pursuit of such recovery.

 

(b) _Taxes_. In calculating the amount of any Loss, there shall be
deducted an amount equal to any net Tax benefit actually realized by the
Indemnified Party (in the form of a reduction in cash Tax otherwise payable,
calculated on a with-and-without basis) in the taxable year in which the
applicable Loss arises or in any prior taxable year and arising by reason of
such Loss, and there shall be added an amount equal to any Tax imposed on,
with respect to or attributable to the receipt of any indemnity payment.

 



50 Section 7.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as expressly provided otherwise,
or in the cause of fraud or intentional misrepresentation based on the express
representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ or _Article IV_ ,
this _Article VII_ will be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnitees
from and after the Closing for any claims arising under this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document, including claims of breach of any representation
or warranty; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing will not be deemed a
waiver by any party of any right to seek specific performance or injunctive
relief as provided for in this Agreement.

 

Section 7.6 _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any indemnifiable Loss. The
amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this _Article
VII_ will be reduced by any amounts that are actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates from any third party, including
any applicable insurance policy (a " _Collateral Source_ "), less, in each
case, any out-of-pocket amounts incurred in pursuing such recovery. The
Indemnified Party will, and will cause its Affiliates to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue all available remedies and causes of action to
recover the amount of its claim as may be available from any Collateral
Source.

Section 7.7 _No Double Recovery_. Notwithstanding the fact that any
Person may have the right to assert claims for indemnification under or in
respect of more than one provision of this Agreement related to any fact,
event, condition or circumstance, no Person will be entitled to recover the
amount of any Losses suffered by such Person more than once under this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents in respect of such fact, event,
condition or circumstance.

 

Section 7.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The parties hereto
agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _Article VII_ as
an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for all applicable Tax purposes,
except to the extent required by applicable Law.

fails to pay either the Purchaser Termination Fee or the Purchaser Financing
Event Termination Fee (each, a " _Reverse_ _Termination Fee_ "), as the case
may be, required pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, on or prior to the
date such amount is due hereunder, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Seller commences an action or proceeding that results in a final,
nonappealable judgment for the payment of such Reverse Termination Fee,
Purchaser (or one or more Purchaser Designees) shall pay, or cause to
be paid, to Seller (i) reimbursement for all costs and expenses (including
disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of
such overdue amount, including in connection with any related claims, actions
or proceedings commenced, and (ii) interest on such amount at an annual rate
equal to 8% per annum which shall accrue from such date through the date such
payment is actually delivered to Seller.

 

(d) In the event that Purchaser (or one or more Purchaser Designees) is
required to pay a Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.3_, and it pays such Reverse Termination Fee, payment of such fee (together
with any amounts paid or payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(c)_) shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller against Purchaser, except in the case
of fraud or any deliberate and intentional action or omission by or on behalf
of Purchaser (it being understood that, without limiting the foregoing, in the
case of fraud or any deliberate and intentional action or omission by or on
behalf of Purchaser in breach of any provision of this Agreement occurring
prior to termination, any prior payment of the Termination Fee shall be taken
into account when determining any remedies).

 



53 (e) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event
shall Purchaser be required to pay more than one Reverse Termination Fee and
any payment of a Reverse Termination Fee described in this _Section_ __ _
8.3_ is not a penalty but is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Seller in the circumstances in which such fees are payable,
and which do not involve fraud or any deliberate and intentional action or
omission in breach of any provision of this Agreement, for the efforts and
resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

 

ARTICLE IX

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 Section 9.1 _Entire Agreement; Assignment; Successors_. This Agreement,
the NDA, and the other Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement
among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all other prior and contemporaneous agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement may not be assigned by
operation of Law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may
assign any or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without
the consent of Seller (a) to any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Purchaser (each, a " _Purchaser Designee_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that
any such assignment will not relieve Purchaser of its obligations under this
Agreement, or (b) for collateral security purposes. Any purported assignment
of this Agreement in contravention of this _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ will be null
and void and of no force or effect. Subject to the preceding sentences of this
_Section_ __ _ 9.1_, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between
the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any other Transaction Document,
the terms of this Agreement will govern.

Section 9.2 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
will nevertheless remain in full force and effect, so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible, in a mutually acceptable manner, in order that the
Transactions will be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Arbitration; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the Laws of the State of New York, United States of America, without regard
to applicable principles of conflicts of Law. Each of the parties hereby waive
any rights that it might otherwise have to assert any rights or defenses under
the Laws of any other nation, territory or to require that litigation brought
by or against it in connection with this Agreement be conducted in the courts
or other forums of any other nation, territory or jurisdiction.

 



55 (b) Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or
the breach thereof shall be resolved by arbitration by either party filing a
written notice of arbitration in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)_
and the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber
of Commerce applicable at the time of submission of the dispute to
arbitration (the " _ICC Rules_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the ICC Rules, the parties hereto agree as follows. The arbitration shall be
held before a panel of three (3) arbitrators consisting of one (1) arbitrator
selected by each party within fifteen (15) days of the notice of arbitration
and the third then selected by those two (2) arbitrators within thirty (30)
days of the appointment of the party-appointed arbitrators. If any arbitrator
is not appointed within the provided timeframes, the missing arbitrator shall
be appointed by the ICC. All arbitrators shall be knowledgeable regarding
international business transactions. The parties hereto shall equally bear
the costs and fees of the arbitration and each of the parties hereto shall
bear its own legal expenses. The parties hereto agree that a court reporter
will record the arbitration proceedings and that the reporters record will
be the agreed transcript of the proceedings. The parties hereto will share the
expenses of this reporter. The arbitrators shall specify the basis for their
decision, the basis for any damages award and a breakdown of any damages
awarded, and the basis of any other remedy authorized under this Agreement,
including but not limited to specific performance or injunctive relief. The
decision of the arbitrators shall be considered as a final and
binding resolution of the disagreement, shall not be subject to appeal and
may be entered as a judgment and enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The exclusive language to be used for the arbitral proceedings
and documentation shall be English and the arbitration shall be held in New
York City, New York, United States of America. Any arbitration proceeding
hereunder shall be conducted on a confidential basis. The arbitrators shall
apply the substantive laws of the State of New York in interpreting and
resolving disputes. The parties hereto shall agree in good faith upon what, if
any, discovery shall be permitted. If the parties hereto cannot agree on the
form of discovery within thirty (30) days after the appointment of
the arbitrators, then discovery shall be governed by the International Bar
Association Rules for the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration. In
no event, however, shall any such discovery take more than three (3) months.

 

(c) TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW THEN IN EFFECT, EACH PARTY
HERETO WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDINGS OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

institute any proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute any
proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ before
exercising any termination right under _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ (and pursuing
damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any Action
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ or anything contained in this _Section_
__ _ 9.9_ restrict or limit any partys right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ or pursue any other
remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter;
_provided_ , _however_ , that except as otherwise expressly provided in
_clause (iv)_ above, in no event shall any party be entitled to monetary
damages in the event of an Order of specific performance to close the
Transactions, _provided_ , that such closing occurs. If any of the parties
hereto brings any action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms
and provisions hereof by any other party hereto, the Termination Date will

is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days or (y) such other time period
established by the state or federal court presiding over such action.

and/or their counsel, including Bass, Berry and Sims PLC, made in connection
with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or
any dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with, this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Acquisition Engagement_ "), which, immediately prior to the Closing, would
be deemed to be privileged communications of Seller, its Affiliates, and/or
their counsel, and would not be subject to disclosure to Purchaser or its
officers, employees, Affiliates and Purchasers and its Affiliates
respective successors and assigns, in connection with any process relating to
a dispute arising under or in connection with this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby or otherwise, such communications shall continue after
the Closing to be privileged communications with and between such Persons and
such counsel and neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates nor any Person
purporting to act on behalf of or through Purchaser or its Affiliates, shall
seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that the privilege
attaching to such communications belongs to Purchaser or the Acquired
Business. For the avoidance of doubt, attorney client privileged
communications among any Person acting on behalf of the Acquired Business,
including directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, and/or their counsel,
including Bass, Berry and Sims PLC, that do not relate to the Acquisition
Engagement shall transfer to Purchaser at the Closing. The parties hereto

of this Agreement, the obligation of each party to pay its own expenses will
be subject to any rights of such party arising from a breach of this Agreement
by any other party.

 

Section 9.12 _Waivers_. No failure or delay of a party in exercising
any right or remedy hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any
single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of
conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would
otherwise have hereunder. Any agreement on the part of any party to any such
waiver will be valid only if set forth in a written instrument executed and
delivered by such party.

 

Section 9.13 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. The parties agree
that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any
applicable Law or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.
