Company Benefit Plan, other than any Company Benefit Plan that is
maintained outside of the United States or pursuant to Laws outside of the
United States or in which employees or service providers of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries who reside primarily outside of the United States

defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), and any other material, written plan,
policy, program, arrangement or agreement (other than standard employment

as may be required by applicable law) providing compensation or benefits to
any current or former director, officer, employee, independent contractor or
other service provider, in each case that is maintained, sponsored or
contributed to by the Company or its Subsidiaries or under which the Company
or its Subsidiaries has or could reasonably be expected to have any
obligation or liability, including, without limitation, all incentive, bonus,
deferred compensation, vacation, holiday, cafeteria, medical, disability,
stock purchase, stock option, stock appreciation, phantom stock, restricted
stock or other stock-based compensation plans, policies, programs, practices
or arrangements, but not including any plan, policy, program, arrangement or
agreement that covers only former directors, officers, employees,
independent contractors and service providers and with respect to which the
Company and its Subsidiaries have no remaining obligations or liabilities.
For the avoidance of doubt, " _Company Benefit Plan_ " includes plans
maintained outside of the United States.

and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, the Company has delivered or made
available to Acquiror correct and complete copies of, if applicable (i) the
current plan document and any trust agreement, (ii) the most recent summary

Plan has been administered in material compliance with its terms and all
applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code and all contributions required
to be made under the terms of any Company Benefit Plan as of the date this
representation is made have been timely made or, if not yet due, have been
properly reflected in the Company's financial statements.

the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (i) has received a favorable
determination or opinion letter as to its qualification, (ii) has been
established under a standardized master and prototype or volume submitter
plan for which a current favorable Internal Revenue Service advisory letter
or opinion letter has been obtained by the plan sponsor and is valid as to
the adopting employer, or (iii) has time remaining under applicable Laws to
apply for a determination or opinion letter or to make any amendments
necessary to obtain a favorable determination or opinion letter. To the
knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred that would reasonably be
expected to result in the loss of the tax-qualified status of such plans.
Each Company Benefit Plan maintained outside of the United States that is
intended to be qualified or registered under applicable Law has been so
qualified or registered and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has
occurred that would reasonably be expected to result in the loss of such
qualification or registration.

ERISA) (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or other pension plan, in each case, that
is subject to Title IV of ERISA. No circumstance or condition exists that
would reasonably be expected to result in an actual obligation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay money on account of any
Multiemployer Plan or other pension plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA
and that is maintained by an ERISA Affiliate of the Company. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _ERISA Affiliate_ " means any entity (whether or not
incorporated) other than the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company that,

(f) Except as would not be reasonably expected to result in material
liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) no event

its Subsidiaries to any tax, fine, lien, or penalty imposed by ERISA or the
Code with respect to any Company Benefit Plan and (ii) no nonexempt

(g) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, with respect to the
Company Benefit Plans, no administrative investigation, audit or other
administrative proceeding by the Department of Labor, the PBGC, the Internal
Revenue Services or other Governmental Authorities are pending, or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened.

  



  

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (either alone or in combination with another event) will result in
the acceleration, vesting or creation of any rights of any director, officer
or employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries to payments or benefits or
increases in any existing payments or benefits or any loan forgiveness, in
each case, from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(i) No amount or benefit that could be, or has been, received (whether
in cash or property or the vesting of property or the cancellation of
indebtedness) by any current or former employee, officer or director of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company who is a "disqualified individual"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code could reasonably be expected to
be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code) as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 31| 
---|---|---

Benefit Plan or award thereunder provides to any "service provider" (within
the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) of the Company or its Subsidiaries
any compensation or benefits which has subjected or could reasonably be
expected in the future to subject such service provider to gross income
inclusion or additional Tax pursuant to Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.

(a) Acquiror has filed in a timely manner all required registration
statements, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
required to be filed by it with the SEC since October 13, 2015 (collectively,
as they have been amended since the time of their filing and including all
exhibits thereto, the " _SEC Reports_ "). As of the date hereof, Acquiror
meets the issuer requirements for use of Form S-3 (or its equivalent) under
the Securities Act. None of the SEC Reports, as of their respective dates (or
if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement or
the Closing Date, then on the date of such filing), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
audited financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements
(including, in each case, the notes and schedules thereto) included in
the SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto
and except with respect to unaudited statements as permitted by Form 10-Q of
the SEC) and fairly present (subject, in the case of the unaudited interim
financial statements included therein, to normal year-end adjustments and the
absence of complete footnotes) in all material respects the financial
position of Acquiror as of the respective dates thereof and the results of
their operations and cash flows for the respective periods then ended.

  



  

(b) Acquiror has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to Acquiror is made known to Acquiror's principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared. To Acquiror's knowledge, such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting Acquiror's principal executive
officer and principal financial officer to material information required to
be included in Acquiror's periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

  



  

(c) Acquiror has established and maintained a system of internal
controls. To Acquiror's knowledge, such internal controls are sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Acquiror's financial
reporting and the preparation of Acquiror's financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP.

  



  

(d) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made
by Acquiror to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the
Exchange Act) or director of Acquiror. Acquiror has not taken any action
prohibited by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  



  

(e) Neither Acquiror (including any employee thereof) nor Acquiror's
independent auditors has identified or been made aware of (i) any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls
utilized by Acquiror, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
Acquiror's management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of

other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any proposed

cause the Form S-4 to be declared effective as promptly as practicable after
it is filed with the SEC and to keep the Form S-4 effective through the
Closing in order to permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  



  

(c) Acquiror shall file the Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the Exchange Act. Acquiror
agrees to include provisions in the Proxy Statement and to take reasonable
action related thereto, with respect to (i) the adoption and approval of this
Agreement, (ii) the approval of the Merger; (iii) the approval of the issuance
of the Exchange Shares for purposes of complying with regulations of the
Nasdaq, (iv) the election of directors effective as of the Closing and (v)
approval of any other proposals reasonably agreed by Acquiror and the Company
to be necessary or appropriate in connection with the
transaction contemplated hereby (collectively, the " _Proposals_ "). Without
the prior written consent of the Company, the Proposals shall be the only
matters (other than procedural matters) which Acquiror shall propose to be
acted on by Acquiror's stockholders at the Annual Meeting.

  



  

(d) Acquiror and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to, as
promptly as practicable (and in any event, within seven Business Days after

the holders of Acquiror Common Stock to vote in favor of each of the
Proposals. Acquiror shall, through the Acquiror Board, recommend to its
stockholders that they approve the Proposals and shall include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 10.02(d)_ , if on a date for which the
Annual Meeting is scheduled, Acquiror has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to obtain the Acquiror
Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Acquiror shall have
the right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the
Annual Meeting, provided that the Annual Meeting (x) is not postponed or
adjourned to a date that is more than 45 days after the date for which the
Annual Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or
postponements required by applicable Law) and (y) is held no later than three
Business Days prior to the Termination Date.

Representatives to take, whether directly or indirectly any action to
solicit, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
enter into any agreement with, or encourage, or provide information to, any
Person (other than Acquiror, Holdings, Merger Sub and/or any of their
Affiliates) concerning any purchase of any of the Company's equity securities
or the issuance and sale of any securities of, or membership interests in,
the Company or its Subsidiaries (other than any purchases of equity securities
by the Company from employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries) or any
merger or sale of substantial assets involving the Company or its
Subsidiaries, other than immaterial assets or assets sold in the ordinary
course of business (each such acquisition transaction, an " _Acquisition
Transaction_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror, Holdings and Merger
Sub hereby acknowledge that prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company
has provided information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and has
afforded access to, and engaged in discussions with, other Persons in
connection with a proposed Acquisition Transaction and that such information,
access and discussions could reasonably enable another Person to form a basis
for a proposal to engage in an Acquisition Transaction without any breach by
the Company of this _Section 10.03(a)_ ; _provided_ , _further_ , however,
that the foregoing acknowledgement shall not in any way diminish the
obligations of the Company, the Cision Owner, and their respective Affiliates
and Representatives pursuant to this sentence and, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Company shall not enter into any further discussions or negotiations or
provide any further information in respect of, or enter into any agreement or
arrangement with respect to, any such proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company may respond to any unsolicited proposal regarding an Acquisition
Transaction by indicating only that the Company is subject to an exclusivity
agreement and is unable to provide any information related to the Company and
its Subsidiaries or entertain any proposals or offers or engage in any
negotiations or discussions concerning an Acquisition Transaction for as long
as that exclusivity agreement remains in effect and, in such event, the
Company shall notify Acquiror of such facts and circumstances. Each of the
Company and the Cision Owner shall, and each shall cause its respective
Affiliates and Representatives to, immediately cease any and all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted prior to the date
hereof with respect to, or which is reasonably likely to give rise to or
result in, an Acquisition Transaction.

  



  

(b) During the Interim Period, none of Acquiror, Holdings or Merger Sub
shall take, nor shall they permit any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives to take, whether directly or indirectly, any action to
solicit, initiate, continue or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
enter into any agreement with, or encourage, respond, provide information to
or commence due diligence with respect to, any Person (other than the
Company, the Cision Owner and/or any of their Affiliates), concerning,
relating to or which is intended or is reasonably likely to give rise to or
result in, any offer, inquiry, proposal or indication of interest, written or
oral relating to any Business Combination (a " _Business Combination Proposal_
") other than with the Company, the Cision Owner and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives. Each of Acquiror, Holdings and Merger Sub
shall, and each shall cause its respective Affiliates and Representatives to,
immediately cease any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to, or which is
reasonably likely to give rise to or result in, a Business Combination
Proposal.

best efforts to so qualify and shall file all Tax Returns consistent with, and
take no position inconsistent with (whether in audits, Tax Returns or
otherwise) such treatment unless required to do so by applicable Law or as

not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except if such
announcement or other communication is required by applicable Law or legal
process (including pursuant to the Securities Law or the rules of any
national securities exchange), in which case Acquiror or the Company, as
applicable, shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to coordinate
such announcement or communication with the other party, prior to
announcement or issuance;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to this
_Section 10.05_ , each party hereto and its Affiliates may make announcements
regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to their

13.08 _Schedules and Exhibits_. The Schedules and Exhibits referenced
herein are a part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein. All
references herein to Schedules and Exhibits shall be deemed references to such
parts of this Agreement, unless the context shall otherwise require. Any
disclosure made by a party in the Schedules with reference to any section or
schedule of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a disclosure with respect to
all other sections or schedules to which such disclosure may apply solely

face of the disclosure in such Schedule. Certain information set forth in the
Schedules is included solely for informational purposes.

  



  

13.09 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Schedules
and Exhibits to this Agreement) and that certain Confidentiality Agreement,
dated as of November 18, 2016 by and between Acquiror and the Cision Owner
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), constitute the entire agreement among
the parties relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and supersede any
other agreements, whether written or oral, that may have been made or entered
into by or among any of the parties hereto or any of their
respective Subsidiaries relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. No
representations, warranties, covenants, understandings, agreements, oral or
otherwise, relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement exist
between the parties except as expressly set forth or referenced in this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

13.10 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole
or in part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed in
the same manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this
Agreement. The approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of any of the
parties shall not restrict the ability of the board of directors of any of the
parties to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 12.01_ or to
cause such party to enter into an amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 13.10_.

  



  

13.11 _Publicity_. All press releases or other public communications
of any nature whatsoever relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the method of the release for publication thereof, shall prior
to the Closing be subject to the prior mutual approval of Acquiror and the
Company which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld by any party.

  



  

13.12 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held
invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The
parties further agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any
extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing
this Agreement, they shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining
provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise
modify this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is
held invalid or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving
effect to the intent of the parties.

  



  

13.13 _Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. Any Action based upon,
arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may be brought in federal and state courts located in the
State of Delaware, and each of the parties irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such Action, waives any
objection it may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to
convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the Action shall be
heard and determined only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in any other court. Nothing herein contained shall be
deemed to affect the right of any party to serve process in any
manner permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed
against any other party in any other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce
judgments obtained in any Action brought pursuant to this _Section 13.13_.
EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

13.14 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the parties do not perform their obligations
under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The
parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without proof of damages, prior to the valid termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 12.01_ , this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, and (b)
the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none of the parties
would have entered into this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the
basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
equity. The parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
injunction.

  



  

13.15 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought
against, the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then
only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to
such party. Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then
only to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party
in this Agreement), (i) no past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any named party to this
Agreement and (ii) no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
advisor or representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any
liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more
of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations or liabilities of any one or more of the Company, the Cision
Owner, Acquiror, Holdings or Merger Sub under this Agreement of or for any
claim based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

13.16 _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. None
of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or
other agreements in this Agreement or in any certificate, statement or
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising
out of any breach of such representations, warranties, covenants, obligations,
agreements and other provisions, shall survive the Closing and shall
terminate and expire upon the occurrence of the Effective Time (and there
shall be no liability after the Closing in respect thereof), except for (a)
those covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms
expressly apply in whole or in part after the Closing and then only with
respect to any breaches occurring after the Closing and (b) this  _Article
XIII_.

their respective Subsidiaries) for purposes of conducting such investigation;
(ii) the Company Representations constitute the sole and exclusive
representations and warranties of the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) the Cision Owner
Representations constitute the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of the Cision Owner in connection with the transactions

Cision Owner Representations by the Cision Owner, and the Acquiror
Representations by Acquiror, Holdings and Merger Sub, none of the parties
hereto or any other Person makes, or has made, any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to any party hereto (or any party's
Subsidiaries) or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all
other representations and warranties of any kind or nature expressed or
implied (including (x) regarding the completeness or accuracy of, or any
omission to state or to disclose, any information, including in the
estimates, projections or forecasts or any other information, document or
material provided to or made available to any party hereto or their
respective Affiliates or Representatives in certain "data rooms," management
presentations or in any other form in expectation of the Transactions,
including meetings, calls or correspondence with management of any
party hereto (or any party's Subsidiaries), and (y) any relating to the
future or historical business, condition (financial or otherwise), results of
operations, prospects, assets or liabilities of any party hereto (or its
Subsidiaries), or the quality, quantity or condition of any party's or its
Subsidiaries' assets) are specifically disclaimed by all parties hereto and
their respective Subsidiaries and all other Persons (including the
Representatives and Affiliates of any party hereto or its Subsidiaries); and
(vi) each party hereto and its respective Affiliates are not relying on any
representations and warranties in connection with the Transactions except the
Company Representations by the Company, the Cision Owner Representations by
the Cision Owner and the Acquiror Representations by Acquiror, Holdings and
Merger Sub.

  



  

(b) Effective upon Closing, each of the parties hereto waives, on its
own behalf and on behalf of its respective Affiliates and Representatives, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, Claims
and causes of action it may have against any other party hereto or their
respective Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former
Affiliates or Representatives relating to the operation of any party hereto
or its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement, the Schedules, or the Exhibits to this Agreement,
whether arising under or based upon any federal, state, local or foreign
statute, Law, ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise. Each party hereto
acknowledges and agrees that it will not assert, institute or maintain any
Action, suit, Claim, investigation, or proceeding of any kind whatsoever,
including a counterclaim, cross-claim, or defense, regardless of the legal or
equitable theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be
imposed, that makes any claim contrary to the agreements and covenants set
forth in this _Section 13.17_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section 13.17(b)_ shall preclude any party from
seeking any remedy for actual and intentional fraud by a party hereto solely
and exclusively with respect to the making of any representation or
warranty by it in _Article V_ , _Article VI_ or _Article VII_ (as
applicable). Each party hereto shall have the right to enforce this _Section
13.17_ on behalf of any Person that would be benefitted or protected by this
_Section 13.17_ if they were a party hereto. The foregoing agreements,
acknowledgements, disclaimers and waivers are irrevocable. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 13.17_ shall limit, modify,
restrict or operate as a waiver with respect to, any rights any party hereto
may have under any written agreement entered into in connection with the
transactions that are contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Nominating Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and the Sponsor
Agreement.
