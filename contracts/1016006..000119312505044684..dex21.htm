-iii- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of March 3,
2005, among JOHNSON and JOHNSON, a New Jersey corporation ("Parent"), HOLDEN
MERGER SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent ("Sub"), and CLOSURE MEDICAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation
(the "Company").



WHEREAS the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Sub has approved
and declared advisable, and the Board of Directors of Parent has approved,
this Agreement and the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger"),
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $.01 per
share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock"), other than (i) shares of
Company Common Stock directly owned by Parent, Sub or the Company and (ii)
the Appraisal Shares, will be converted into the right to receive $27.00 in
cash;



WHEREAS simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as a condition to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, Parent
and certain stockholders of the Company (the "Principal Stockholders") entered
into an agreement (the "Stockholder Agreement") pursuant to which the
Principal Stockholders agreed to vote to approve and adopt this Agreement and
to take certain other actions in furtherance of the consummation of the Merger
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Stockholder
Agreement; and



WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also
to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 



ARTICLE I



_The Merger_



SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the
separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations
of Sub in accordance with the DGCL.



SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be
no later    than the second business day after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted
by law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by law) waiver of
those conditions), at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, Worldwide
Plaza, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019, unless another time, date
or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if all the conditions set forth in Article VI shall not have
been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by law) waived on such second
business day, then the Closing shall take place on the first business day on
which all such conditions shall have been satisfied or (to the extent
permitted by law) waived. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to
in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".



SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") executed and acknowledged by the parties in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and, as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree
and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes
effective being the "Effective Time").



SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.



SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws._ (a) The Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "Company Certificate") shall
be amended at the Effective Time to be in the form of Exhibit A and, as so
amended, such Company Certificate shall be the Restated Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable law.



(b) The By-laws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable law.



SECTION 1.06. _Directors._ The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.



SECTION 1.07. _Officers._  The officers of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 



 

2 ARTICLE II



_Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the_

_Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_



SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Sub:

 



(a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.



(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ Each share of
Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company, Parent or Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.



(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and the Appraisal
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $27.00 in cash, without
interest (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such shares
of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration. As
provided in Section 2.02(h), the right of any holder of a Certificate to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount
of any withholding that is required under applicable tax law.



(d) _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.01(c), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair
value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to  



 

3  receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders
Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall
be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have
become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to
do any of the foregoing.



SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall appoint JPMorgan Chase or another comparable bank
or trust company to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment
of the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Certificates, cash in an amount sufficient to pay
the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section
2.01(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").



(b) _Exchange Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and which shall be in customary form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Each holder of record of a Certificate shall, upon surrender
to the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the amount of cash which the number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into the
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the  



 

4  reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b),
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration which the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of
such Certificate pursuant to this Article II. No interest shall be paid or
will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II.



(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All cash paid upon
the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer,
it shall be canceled against delivery of cash to the holder thereof as
provided in this Article II.



(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain
liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration.



(e) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to two years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger
Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.



(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. 



(g) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect thereto.



 

5 (h) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent.



ARTICLE III



_Representations and Warranties_



SECTION 3.01. _Representations and Warranties of the Company._ Except as set
forth in the disclosure schedule (with specific reference to the particular
Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information set forth in
such disclosure schedule relates; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any
information set forth in one section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
be deemed to apply to each other Section or subsection thereof or hereof to
which its relevance is readily apparent on its face) delivered by the Company
to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule"), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows:



(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power._ The Company has been duly
organized, and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, as the case may be, and has
all requisite power and authority and possesses all governmental licenses,
permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to use its
corporate or other name and to own, lease or otherwise hold and operate its
properties and other assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted and as currently proposed by its management to be conducted, except
where the failure to have such government licenses, permits, authorizations or
approvals individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The  



 

6  Company has made available to Parent, prior to the execution of this
Agreement, complete and accurate copies of the Company Certificate and its By-
laws (the "Company By-laws"), in each case as amended to the date hereof. The
Company has made available to Parent complete and accurate copies of the
minutes (or, in the case of minutes that have not yet been finalized, drafts
thereof) of all meetings of the stockholders of the Company, the Board of
Directors of the Company and the committees of its Board of Directors, in each
case held since January 1, 2002 and prior to the date hereof.



(b) _Subsidiaries._ The Company does not have, and has never had, any
Subsidiaries. The Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital
stock of, or other voting securities or equity interests in, any corporation,
partnership, joint venture, association or other entity.



(c) _Capital Structure._ The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of 35,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 2,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $.01 per share ("Company Preferred Stock"). At the close of
business on March 2, 2005, (i) 14,445,563 shares of Company Common Stock were
issued and outstanding, (ii) no shares of Company Common Stock were held by
the Company in its treasury, (iii) 7,269,604 shares of Company Common Stock
were reserved for issuance pursuant to the Amended and Restated 1996
Equity Compensation Plan of the Company and the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan of the Company (the "ESPP", and such plans collectively, the "Company
Stock Plans"), of which 4,873,628 shares of Company Common Stock were subject
to outstanding Company Stock Options, (iv) other than as set forth in clause
(v), no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding or were
held by the Company in its treasury and (v) 50,000 shares of Company Preferred
Stock designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares were
reserved for issuance in connection with the rights (the "Rights") to be
issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated as of July 31, 2001, between the
Company and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as rights agent (the
"Rights Agreement"). Except as set forth above in this Section 3.01(c), at the
close of business on March 2, 2005, no shares of capital stock or other voting
securities or equity interests of the Company were issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding. There are no outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock subject to vesting or restrictions on
transfer, stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), "phantom" stock rights,
performance units, rights to receive shares of Company Common Stock on a
deferred basis or other rights (other than Company Stock Options) that are
linked to the value of Company Common Stock (collectively, but exclusive of
rights under the ESPP, "Company Stock-Based Awards"). Section 3.01(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list, as of
March 2, 2005, of all outstanding options to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (collectively, but exclusive of rights under the ESPP,
"Company Stock Options") under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise, the
number of shares of Company Common Stock (or other  



 

7  stock) subject thereto, the grant dates, expiration dates, exercise or base
prices (if applicable) and vesting schedules thereof and the names of the
holders thereof. All (i) outstanding shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which the Company has a right under specified circumstances to
repurchase such shares by the Company at a fixed purchase price and (ii)
Company Stock Options are evidenced by stock option agreements, restricted
stock purchase agreements or other award agreements, in each case in the forms
set forth in Section 3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and no stock
option agreement, restricted stock purchase agreement or other award
agreement contains terms that are inconsistent with such forms. There are no
Company Stock Options intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under
Section 422 of the Code, and the exercise price of each Company Stock Option
is no less than the fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock as
determined on the date of grant of such Company Stock Option. As of the close
of business on March 2, 2005, there were outstanding Company Stock Options to
purchase 3,962,148 shares of Company Common Stock with exercise prices on a
per share basis lower than the Merger Consideration, and the weighted average
exercise price of such Company Stock Options was equal to $19.21. The maximum
number of shares of Company Common Stock that could be purchased with
accumulated payroll deductions under the ESPP at the close of business of July
29, 2005 is 25,000, which number was calculated assuming (A) the fair market
value of a share of Company Common Stock on such date is equal to the Merger
Consideration and payroll deductions continue at the current rate, (B) not
giving effect to any limitation contained in the ESPP as to the number of
shares that a participant may purchase in any given period and (C) excluding
any individuals that are on leave from their employment with the Company as of
the date of this Agreement. Each Company Stock Option may, by its terms, be
canceled in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby for a lump
sum cash payment in accordance with and to the extent required by Section
5.04(a). All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are, and all
shares which may be issued pursuant to the Company Stock Options or rights
under the ESPP will be, when issued in accordance with the terms thereof,
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject
to preemptive rights. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which
stockholders of the Company may vote. Except as set forth above in this
Section 3.01(c), (x) there are not issued, reserved for issuance
or outstanding (A) any shares of capital stock or other voting securities or
equity interests of the Company, (B) any securities of the Company convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of capital stock or other
voting securities or equity interests of the Company or (C) any warrants,
calls, options or other rights to acquire from the Company, and no obligation
of the Company to issue, any capital stock, voting securities, equity
interests or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
capital stock or voting securities of the Company and (y) there are not any
outstanding obligations of the Company to repurchase, redeem or  



 

8  otherwise acquire any such securities or to issue, deliver or sell, or cause
to be issued, delivered or sold, any such securities. The Company is not a
party to any voting agreement with respect to the voting of any such
securities.



(d) _Authority; Noncontravention._ The Company has all requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject to
receipt of the Stockholder Approval, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, subject, in
the case of the consummation of the Merger, to the obtaining of the
Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
each of the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and
the availability of equitable remedies. The Board of Directors of the
Company, at a meeting duly called and held at which all directors of the
Company were present, duly and unanimously adopted resolutions (i) approving
and declaring advisable this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) declaring that it is in the best
interests of the stockholders of the Company that the Company enter into this
Agreement and consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, (iii) directing that the adoption of this Agreement be
submitted as promptly as practicable to a vote at a meeting of the
stockholders of the Company and (iv) recommending that the stockholders of
the Company adopt this Agreement, which resolutions, as of the date of this
Agreement, have not been subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any
way. The execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of,

9  properties or other assets is subject or (z) subject to (i) the Stockholder
Approval and (ii) the governmental filings and the other matters referred to
in the following sentence, any (A) statute, law, ordinance, rule or
regulation applicable to the Company or its properties or other assets or (B)
order, writ, injunction, decree, judgment or stipulation, in each case
applicable to the Company or its properties or other assets, other than, in
the case of clauses (y) and (z), any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults, rights, losses or Liens that individually or in the aggregate have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, action by or in
respect of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Federal, state,
local or foreign government, any court, administrative, regulatory or
other governmental agency, commission or authority or any non-governmental
self-regulatory agency, commission or authority (each, a "Governmental

execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation
of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except
for (1) the filing of a premerger notification and report form by the Company

(e) _Company SEC Documents._ (i) The Company has filed all reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits and other
information incorporated therein) with the SEC required to be filed by the
Company since January 1, 2002 (such documents, together with any documents
filed during such period by the Company with the SEC on a voluntary basis on
Current Reports on Form 8-K, the "Company SEC Documents"). As of their
respective filing dates, the Company SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Securities
 



 

10  Act"), the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (including the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, "SOX") applicable to such
Company SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Except to the extent that information contained in any Company SEC
Document has been revised, amended, supplemented or superseded by a later-
filed Company SEC Document, none of the Company SEC Documents contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, which individually or in the aggregate would require an amendment,
supplement or corrective filing to any such Company SEC Document. Each of the
financial statements (including the related notes) of the Company included in
the Company SEC Documents complied at the time it was filed as to form in all
material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto in effect at
the time of filing, has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") (except, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects
the financial position of the Company as of the dates thereof and the results
of its operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments). Except as
disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed by the Company and publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Filed Company
SEC Documents"), the Company does not have any liabilities or obligations of
any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) which
individually or in the aggregate have had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.



(ii) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer
of the Company and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14
under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the
Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are
true and accurate. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive
officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to
such terms in SOX. The Company does not have any outstanding, or has not
arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive
officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.



(iii) The Company maintains a system of "internal control over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
 



 

11  sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP, consistently applied, (B) that transactions are
executed only in accordance with the authorization of management and (C)
regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of the Companys assets. 



(iv) The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to ensure
that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports. 



(v) The Company is not a party to, or does not have any commitment to become
a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet partnership or any similar
Contract (including any Contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among the Company, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand or any "off balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company in the Companys published financial statements or
other Company SEC Documents.



(vi) Since January 1, 2003, the Company has not received any oral or written
notification of any (x) "significant deficiency" or (y) "material weakness" in
the Companys internal controls over financial reporting. There is no
outstanding "significant deficiency" or "material weakness" which the
Companys independent accountants certify has not been appropriately and
adequately remedied by the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the
terms "significant deficiency" and "material weakness" shall have the
meanings assigned to them in Release 2004-001 of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board, as in effect on the date hereof.



(f) _Information Supplied._ None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of the Company specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is
first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at the time of
the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, except  



 

12  that no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Sub in writing specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. The Proxy
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act.

in connection with this Agreement and except as disclosed in the Filed Company
SEC Documents or as expressly permitted pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(i) through
(xvi), since the date of the most recent audited financial statements

under any Company Benefit Agreement or Company Benefit Plan in effect as of
the date of the most recent audited financial statements included in the Filed
Company SEC Documents, (B) any granting by the Company to any current or

Documents, (v) any damage, destruction or loss to any asset of the Company,
whether or not covered by insurance, that individually or in the aggregate has

any change in accounting methods, principles or practices by the Company
materially affecting its assets, liabilities or businesses, except insofar as

there is no suit, action or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its assets
that individually or in the aggregate has had or would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding
against, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, investigation by any
Governmental Entity involving, the Company or any of its assets that
individually or in the aggregate has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.



(i) _Contracts._ (i) Except as disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents
and except with respect to licenses and other agreements relating to
intellectual property, which are the subject of Section 3.01(p), as of the
date hereof, the Company is not a party to, and none of its properties or
other assets is subject to, any Contract that is of a nature required to be
filed as an exhibit to a report or filing under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Neither the
Company nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto is in
violation of or in default under (nor does there exist any condition which
upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would cause such a
violation of or default under) any Contract, to which it is a party or by
which it or any of its properties or other assets is bound, except for
violations or defaults that individually or in the aggregate have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has not entered into any Contract with any Affiliate of the Company
that is currently in effect other than agreements that are disclosed in the
Filed Company SEC Documents. The Company is not a party to or otherwise bound
by  



 

14  any agreement or covenant restricting the Companys or any of its
Affiliates ability to compete or by any agreement or covenant restricting in
any respect the research, development, distribution, sale, supply, license,
marketing or manufacturing of products or services of the Company or any of
its Affiliates.



(ii) Each employee, contractor or consultant of the Company who has
proprietary knowledge of or information relating to the manufacturing
processes, or the formulation of the products, of the Company has executed and
delivered to the Company an agreement or agreements, substantially in the
form(s) set forth in Section 3.01(i)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
restricting such persons right to (A) use and disclose confidential
information of the Company and (B) enter into certain employment, consulting
or similar contractual relationships with companies that are competitors of
the Company for a specified period of time.



(j)  _Compliance with Laws; Environmental Matters._ (i) Except with respect
to Environmental Laws, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA") and taxes, which are the subjects of Sections 3.01(j)(ii),
3.01(l) and 3.01(n), respectively, and except as set forth in the Filed
Company SEC Documents, the Company is in compliance with all statutes, laws,
ordinances, rules, regulations, judgments, orders and decrees of any
Governmental Entity applicable to it, its properties or other assets or its
business or operations (collectively, "Legal Provisions"), except for failures
to be in compliance that individually or in the aggregate have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has in effect all approvals, authorizations, certificates, filings,
franchises, licenses, notices and permits of or with all Governmental Entities
(collectively, "Permits"), including all Permits under the Federal Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended (including the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the "FDCA"), and the regulations of the Federal Food
and Drug Administration (the "FDA") promulgated thereunder, necessary for it
to own, lease or operate its properties and other assets and to carry on its
business and operations as presently conducted and as currently proposed by
its management to be conducted, except where the failure to have such Permits
individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There has occurred no default
under, or violation of, any such Permit, except for any such default or
violation that individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The consummation of
the Merger, in and of itself, would not cause the revocation or cancellation
of any such Permit that individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No action, demand, requirement or
investigation by any Governmental Entity and no suit, action or proceeding by
any other person, in each case with respect to the Company or any of its
properties or other assets under any Legal Provision, is pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, other than, in each case, those the
outcome of which individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.



 

15 (ii) Except for those matters disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents:
(A) the Company is, and has been, in compliance in all material respects with
all Environmental Laws and has obtained and complied with all material Permits
required under any Environmental Laws to own, lease or operate its properties
or other assets and to carry on its business and operations as presently
conducted and as currently proposed by its management to be conducted; (B) to
the Knowledge of the Company, there have been no Releases or threatened
Releases of Hazardous Materials in, on, under or affecting any properties
currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by the Company or any of its
former Subsidiaries that would require investigation or clean-up under
Environmental Laws; (C) there is no material investigation, suit,
claim, action or proceeding pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its former Subsidiaries
relating to or arising under Environmental Laws, and the Company has not
received any notice of any such investigation, suit, claim, action or
proceeding; (D) neither the Company nor any of its former Subsidiaries has
entered into or assumed by contract or operation of law or otherwise, any
material obligation, liability, order, settlement, judgment, injunction or
decree relating to or arising under Environmental Laws; and (E) there are no
facts, circumstances or conditions that would reasonably be expected to form
the basis for any material investigation, suit, claim, action, proceeding
or liability against or affecting the Company relating to or arising under
Environmental Laws. The term "Environmental Laws" means all applicable
Federal, state, local and foreign laws (including common law), statutes,
rules, regulations, codes, ordinances, orders, decrees, judgments,

(k) _Absence of Changes in Company Benefit Plans; Labor Relations._ Except as
disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents or as expressly permitted
pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(i) through (xvi), since the date of the most  



 

16  recent audited financial statements included in the Filed Company SEC
Documents, there has not been any adoption or amendment by the Company of
any collective bargaining agreement or any employment, bonus, pension, profit
sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock
purchase, stock appreciation, restricted stock, stock option, "phantom"
stock, performance, retirement, thrift, savings, stock bonus, paid time off,
perquisite, fringe benefit, vacation, severance, disability, death benefit,
hospitalization, medical, welfare benefit or other plan, program, policy,
arrangement, agreement or understanding (whether or not legally binding)
maintained, contributed to or required to be maintained or contributed to by
the Company or any other person or entity that, together with the Company, is
treated as a single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the
Code (each, a "Commonly Controlled Entity"), in each case providing benefits
to any current or former director, officer, employee or consultant of the
Company or any of its former Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company Benefit
Plans"), or any material change in any actuarial or other assumption used to
calculate funding obligations with respect to any Company Pension Plans, or
any change in the manner in which contributions to any Company Pension Plans
are made or the basis on which such contributions are determined, other than
amendments or other changes as required to ensure that such Company Benefit
Plan is not then out of compliance with applicable law, or reasonably
determined by the Company to be necessary or appropriate to preserve the
qualified status of a Company Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code.
Except as disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents, there exist no
currently binding Company Benefit Agreements. There are no collective
bargaining or other labor union agreements to which the Company is a party or
by which the Company is bound. As of the date hereof, none of the employees of
the Company are represented by any union with respect to their employment by
the Company. As of the date hereof, since January 1, 2002, the Company has not
experienced any labor disputes, union organization attempts or work stoppages,
slowdowns or lockouts due to labor disagreements.



(l) _ERISA Compliance._ (i) Section 3.01(l)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule contains a complete and accurate list of each Company Benefit Plan
that is an "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA) (sometimes referred to herein as a "Company Pension Plan"), each
Company Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA) and all other Company Benefit Plans. The Company has
provided to Parent complete and accurate copies of (A) each Company Benefit
Plan (or, in the case of any unwritten Company Benefit Plans, descriptions
thereof), (B) the two most recent annual reports on Form 5500 required to be
filed with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with respect to each
Company Benefit Plan (if any such report was required), (C) the most recent
summary plan description for each Company Benefit Plan for which such summary
plan description is required and (D) each trust agreement and insurance or
group annuity contract relating to any Company Benefit Plan. Each Company  



 

17  Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects in accordance
with its terms. The Company and all the Company Benefit Plans are all in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA,
the Code and all other applicable laws, including laws of foreign
jurisdictions, and the terms of all collective bargaining agreements.



(ii) All Company Pension Plans intended to be tax-qualified have received
favorable determination letters from the IRS with respect to "TRA" (as defined
in Section 1 of Rev. Proc. 93-39), and have timely filed with the IRS
determination letter applications (or have received such a
determination letter) with respect to "GUST" (as defined in Section 1 of
Notice 2001-42) and the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of
2001, to the effect that such Company Pension Plans are qualified and exempt
from Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of
the Code, no such determination letter has been revoked (or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, has revocation been threatened) and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, no event has occurred since the date of the most recent
determination letter or application therefor relating to any such Company
Pension Plan that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualification of such Company Pension Plan or materially increase the
costs relating thereto or require security under Section 307 of ERISA. No
Company Pension Plans are required to have been approved by any foreign
Governmental Entity. The Company has delivered to Parent a complete and
accurate copy of the most recent determination letter received prior to the
date hereof with respect to each Company Pension Plan, as well as a complete
and accurate copy of each pending application for a determination letter, if
any. The Company has also provided to Parent a complete and accurate list of
all amendments to any Company Pension Plan as to which a favorable
determination letter has not yet been received.



(iii) Neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has (A)
maintained, contributed to or been required to contribute to any Company
Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or (B) has any unsatisfied
liability under Title IV of ERISA.



(iv) All reports, returns and similar documents with respect to all Company
Benefit Plans required to be filed with any Governmental Entity or
distributed to any Company Benefit Plan participant have been duly and timely
filed or distributed in all material respects. The Company has not received
notice of, and to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no investigations by
any Governmental Entity with respect to, termination proceedings or other
claims (except claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the
Company Benefit Plans), suits or proceedings against or involving any Company
Benefit Plan or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Company
Benefit Plan that would give rise to any material liability, and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, there are not any facts that could give rise to any
material liability in the event of any such investigation, claim, suit or
proceeding.



 

18 (v) All contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or in connection
with the Company Benefit Plans that are required to have been made as of the
date hereof in accordance with the terms of the Company Benefit Plans have
been timely made or have been reflected on the most recent consolidated
balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference into the Filed Company SEC
Documents. Neither any Company Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of
any Commonly Controlled Entity has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as
such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code),
whether or not waived.



(vi) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, (A) there has not occurred any
prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code) in which the Company or any of its employees, or any
trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of such Company Benefit Plan, or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, any agent of the foregoing, has engaged that
would reasonably be expected to subject the Company or any of its
employees, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, a trustee, administrator or
other fiduciary of any trust created under any Company Benefit Plan, to the
tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code
or the sanctions imposed under Title I of ERISA and (B) neither the Company
nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any trustee, administrator or other
fiduciary of any Company Benefit Plan nor any agent of any of the foregoing,
has engaged in any transaction or acted in a manner, or failed to act in a
manner, that would reasonably be expected to subject the Company or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary, to
any liability for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA or any
other applicable law. No Company Benefit Plan or related trust has been
terminated during the last five years, nor has there been any "reportable
event" (as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the 30-day
reporting requirement has not been waived with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan during the last five years, and no notice of a reportable event will be
required to be filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



(vii) Section 3.01(l)(vii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule discloses
whether each Company Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan is
(A) unfunded or self-insured, (B) funded through a "welfare benefit fund", as
such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the Code, or other funding
mechanism or (C) insured. Each such employee welfare benefit plan may be
amended or terminated (including with respect to benefits provided to retirees
and other former employees) without material liability (other than benefits
then payable under such plan without regard to such amendment or termination)
to the Company at any time after the Effective Time. The Company complies in
all  



 

19  material respects with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of
the Code, Sections 601-609 of ERISA or any similar state or local law with
respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is a group health plan, as such
term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code or such state statute. The
Company does not have any material obligations for retiree health or life
insurance benefits under any Company Benefit Plan (other than for
continuation coverage required under Section 4980(f) of the Code).



(viii) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Stockholder
Agreement, the obtaining of the Stockholder Approval or the consummation of
the Merger or any other transaction expressly contemplated by this Agreement
or the Stockholder Agreement (including as a result of any termination of
employment on or following the Effective Time) will (A) entitle any current
or former director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company to
severance or termination pay, (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting,
or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of,
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any
other material obligation pursuant to, any Company Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Agreement or (C) result in any breach or violation of, or a default
under, any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement. The total
amount of all severance payments and the fair market value of all non-cash
benefits (other than Company Stock Options) that may become payable or
provided to any director, officer, employee or consultant of the
Company under agreements described in clause (2) of the definition of the
Company Benefit Agreements contained in Section 3.01(g)(iv)(C) (assuming for
such purpose that such individuals employment were terminated immediately
following the Effective Time as if the Effective Time were the date listed in
Section 3.01(l)(viii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) will not exceed the
amount set forth in Section 3.01(l)(viii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.



(ix) The Company does not have any material liability or obligations,
including under or on account of a Company Benefit Plan, arising out of the
hiring of persons to provide services to the Company and treating such persons

consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and compliance with the provisions  



 

32  of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)

acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit under, or result in
the creation of any Lien in or upon any of the properties or other assets of

Parent or Sub or their respective properties or other assets, and in each
case, in any way that would prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation by Parent of the Merger (including the payments required to be
made pursuant to Article II) or the other transactions contemplated hereby. No
material consent, approval, order or authorization of, action by or in respect
of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is

by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to
the stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

(c) _Advice of Changes; Filings._ The Company and Parent shall
promptly advise the other party orally and in writing of (i) any
representation or warranty made by it (and, in the case of Parent, made by
Sub) contained in this Agreement that is  



 

37  qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or
any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure of it (and, in the
case of Parent, of Sub) to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it (and,
in the case of Parent, of Sub) under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. The
Company and Parent shall, to the extent permitted by law, promptly provide the
other with copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated

each such entity; (B) timely pay all taxes due and payable that are so filed;
(C) accrue a reserve in the books and records and financial statements of any
such entity in accordance with past practice for all taxes payable by such

(D) promptly notify Parent of any suit, claim, action, investigation,

Company is or may otherwise be bound to be terminated as of the Closing Date
so that after such date the Company shall have no further rights or
liabilities thereunder. Any tax returns described in this Section 4.01(d)
shall be complete and correct in all material respects and shall be prepared
on a basis consistent with the past practice of the Company and in a manner
that does not distort taxable income ( _e.g._ , by deferring income or
accelerating deductions); _provided_ that no Post-Signing Returns shall be
filed with any taxing authority without Parents prior written consent.



(ii) The Company shall deliver to Parent at or prior to the Closing a
certificate, in form and substance satisfactory to Parent, duly executed and
acknowledged, certifying that the payment of the Merger Consideration and any
payments made in respect of the Appraisal Shares pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement are exempt from withholding pursuant to the Foreign Investment
in Real Property Tax Act.



SECTION 4.02. _No Solicitation._ (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any of its directors, officers or employees or
any investment banker,  



 

38  financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or
representative (collectively, "Representatives") retained by it or any of
its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action designed
to, or which would reasonably be expected to, facilitate, any Takeover
Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
information, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Takeover Proposal.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of the
Company shall be a breach of this Section 4.02(a) by the Company. The Company
shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions
or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect to any
Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, in response to a
bona fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which Takeover
Proposal was not solicited after the date hereof and was made after the date
hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section
4.02(a), the Company may, if its Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel) that it is required to do so in
order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable law, and subject to compliance with Section 4.02(c), (x)
furnish information with respect to the Company to the person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement (which (A) need not restrict such person from
making an unsolicited Takeover Proposal and (B) shall permit the Company to
comply with Section 4.02(c)) not less restrictive of such person than the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that all such information has
previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person, and (y)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal.



The term "Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
person relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, of assets or businesses that constitute 15% or more of the
revenues, net income or the assets of the Company, or 15% or more of any class
of equity securities of the Company, any tender offer or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more of
any class of equity securities of the Company or any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint
venture, binding share exchange or similar transaction involving the Company
pursuant to which any person or the shareholders of any person would own 15%
or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or of any resulting
parent company of the Company, other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement.



 

39 The term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide offer made by a third party
that if consummated would result in such person (or its stockholders) owning,
directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of the shares of Company
Common Stock then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the
direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or
substantially all the assets of the Company, which the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be (i) more
favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view
than the Merger (taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the financial terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise)) and
(ii) reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial,
legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.



(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or
publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of
Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or
approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Takeover
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a
"Company Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Affiliates
to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 4.02(a)) (an "Acquisition
Agreement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that it is
required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no Company Adverse Recommendation Change may be made until after the
fourth business day following Parents receipt of written notice (a "Notice
of Adverse Recommendation") from the Company advising Parent that the Board of
Directors of the Company intends to take such action and specifying the
reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal
that is the basis of the proposed action by the Board of Directors (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other
material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Adverse Recommendation and a new four business day period). In determining
whether to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall take into account any changes to the financial
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a Notice of Adverse
Recommendation or otherwise.



 

40 (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally
and in writing of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of
any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any changes thereto) and the
identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The
Company shall (i) keep Parent fully informed of the status and details
(including any change to any material term thereof) of any such Takeover
Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable after
receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all correspondence and other
written material sent or provided to the Company from any person that
describes any of the terms or conditions of any Takeover Proposal.



(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company
from (x) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (y) making any disclosure
to the stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Board
of Directors of the Company (after consultation with outside counsel) failure
to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable
law, including the Board of Directors duty of candor to the stockholders of
the Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or
its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to
take, any action prohibited by Section 4.02(b).

to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Stockholder Agreement, including using commercially reasonable efforts to
accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the
conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and

ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Stockholder Agreement, the Merger or

Stockholder Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement, the Stockholder Agreement, the Merger and the other  



 

43  transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent to agree to,
or proffer to, divest or hold separate any assets or any portion of any
business of Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Company.

become entitled to receive, as soon as practicable following the Effective

shares of Company Common Stock for which such Company Stock Option shall not
theretofore have been exercised and (2) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option;
and



(ii) make such other changes to the Company Stock Plans as the Company and
Parent may agree are appropriate to give effect to the Merger.



(b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee of the Board of

the ESPP (i) participants may not increase their payroll deductions or
purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement, (ii) no
offering period shall be commenced after the date of this Agreement, (iii)
each participants outstanding right to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock under the ESPP shall terminate on the day immediately prior to the day
on which the Effective Time occurs, _provided_ that all amounts allocated to
each participants account under the ESPP as of such date shall thereupon be
used to purchase from the Company whole shares of Company Common Stock at the
applicable price determined under the terms of the ESPP for the
then outstanding offering periods using such date as the final purchase date
for each such offering period, and (iv) the ESPP shall terminate immediately
following such purchases of Company Common Stock.



(c) All amounts payable to holders of the Company Stock Options pursuant
to Section 5.04(a) shall be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and

without further action, as of the Effective Time and such obligations shall

(c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain (directly or
indirectly through the Companys existing insurance programs) in effect the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each
person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policy (a complete and accurate copy of which has been heretofore
delivered to Parent), on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no
less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may (i) substitute therefor policies of
Parent containing terms with respect to coverage (including as coverage
relates to deductibles and exclusions) and amounts no less favorable to such
directors and officers or (ii) request that the Company obtain such extended
reporting period coverage under its existing insurance programs (to be
effective as of the Effective Time); _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that
in satisfying its obligation under this Section 5.05(c), neither the Company
nor Parent shall be obligated to pay more than $1,000,000 in the aggregate to
obtain such coverage. It is understood and agreed that in the event such
coverage cannot be obtained for $1,000,000 or less in the aggregate, Parent
shall be obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such
$1,000,000 aggregate amount.



(d) The provisions of this Section 5.05 (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and
his or

for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have by contract or otherwise.

is consummated.



(b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.01(e) or (ii) (A) prior to the obtaining of the
Stockholder Approval, a Takeover Proposal shall have been made to the Company
or shall have been made directly to the stockholders of the Company generally
or shall have otherwise become publicly known or any person shall have
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a
Takeover Proposal, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) (but only if a vote to
obtain the Stockholder Approval or the Stockholders Meeting has not been
held) or Section 7.01(b)(iii) and (C) within 12 months after such termination,
the Company enters into a definitive Contract to consummate, or consummates,
the transactions contemplated by any Takeover Proposal, then the
Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $12,627,000 (the "Termination Fee")

(c) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained
in Section 5.06(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the
amount due pursuant to Section 5.06(b), and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for
the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,

contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be required by
applicable law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing  



 

46  agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system. The parties agree that all formal Company employee

shares of capital stock, warrants, options, stock appreciation rights or other
rights in respect of any shares of capital stock of any entity or any
securities convertible or exchangeable into such shares pursuant to any such
plans or arrangements; _provided_ , _further_ , that no plans or arrangements
of the Company providing for such issuance shall be taken into account in
determining whether employee benefits are substantially comparable in the
aggregate.



(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize the service of
each Continuing Employee as if such service had been performed with Parent (i)
for purposes of vesting (but not benefit accrual) under Parents defined
benefit pension plan, (ii) for purposes of eligibility for vacation under
Parents vacation program, (iii) for purposes of eligibility and participation
under any health or welfare plan maintained by Parent (other than any post-

47  accrual purposes under Parents severance plan (in the case of each of
clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), solely to the extent that Parent makes
such plan or program available to employees of the Surviving Corporation),
but not for purposes of any other employee benefit plan of Parent.



(c) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to continue any specific plans or to continue
the employment of any specific person.



(d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent in which Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such
conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees
under the welfare plans of the Company prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable under any

of Sub, to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Sub, as applicable, of
any of its obligations hereunder; _provided_ that any such assignee of Parent
or Sub, as applicable, shall be primarily liable with respect to the
obligations hereunder and the liability of Parent or  



 

55  Sub, as applicable, shall be secondary. Subject to the preceding sentence,

fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party hereto (a)
certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event
of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and
(b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to
enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and
certifications in this Section 8.11.



SECTION 8.12. _Severability._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end

A-2 EXHIBIT A

TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT



_Restated Certificate of Incorporation_

_of the Surviving Corporation_



_FIRST_ : The name of the corporation (hereinafter called the "Corporation")
is Closure Medical Corporation.



_SECOND_ : The address, including street, number, city, and county, of the
registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware is Corporate
Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, County of New Castle, Wilmington, Delaware
19801; and the name of the registered agent of the Corporation in the State
of Delaware at such address is The Corporation Trust Company.



_THIRD_ : The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.



_FOURTH_ : The aggregate number of shares which the Corporation shall have
authority to issue is 1,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share.



_FIFTH_ : In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it
by law, the Board of Directors of the Corporation is expressly authorized to
adopt, amend or repeal the By-laws of the Corporation.



_SIXTH_ : To the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware as it now exists and as it may hereafter be amended, no
director or officer of the Corporation shall be personally liable to
the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director or officer; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
contained in this Article SIXTH shall eliminate or limit the liability of a
director or officer (i) for any breach of the directors or officers duty of
loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not
in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation
of law, (iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware or (iv) for any transaction from which the director or
officer derived an improper personal benefit. No amendment to or repeal of
this Article SIXTH shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or
alleged liability of any director or officer of the Corporation for or with
respect to any acts or omissions of such director or officer occurring prior
to such amendment or repeal.



_SEVENTH_ : The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Section
145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same may
be amended and supplemented, indemnify any and all persons whom it shall have
power to indemnify under said Section from and against any and all of the
expenses, liabilities, or other matters referred to in or covered by said
Section. Such indemnification shall be mandatory and not discretionary. The
indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any by-law,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both
   as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another
capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director, officer, employee, or agent and shall inure to the
benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such a person. Any
repeal or modification of this Article SEVENTH shall not adversely affect any
right to indemnification of any persons existing at the time of such repeal
or modification with respect to any matter occurring prior to such repeal or
modification.



The Corporation shall to the fullest extent permitted by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware advance all costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by any
director or officer within 15 days of the presentation of same to the
Corporation, with respect to any one or more actions, suits or proceedings,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, so long as the
Corporation receives from the director or officer an unsecured undertaking to
repay such expenses if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or
officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Such obligation to advance
costs and expenses shall be mandatory, and not discretionary, and shall
include, without limitation, costs and expenses incurred in
asserting affirmative defenses, counterclaims and cross claims. Such
undertaking to repay may, if first requested in writing by the applicable
director or officer, be on behalf of (rather than by) such director or
officer, _provided_ that in such case the Corporation shall have the right to
approve the party making such undertaking.



_EIGHTH_ : Unless and except to the extent that the By-laws of the Corporation
shall so require, the election of directors of the Corporation need not be by
written ballot.
