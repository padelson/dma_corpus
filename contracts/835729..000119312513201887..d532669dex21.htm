of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and BMC Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ ").

_W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_   _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub be merged with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that it is
in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it
advisable, to enter into this Agreement, (ii) approved the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement, and (iii) resolved to recommend adoption
of this Agreement, including the Merger, by the stockholders of the Company.

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have approved this
Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger Sub, respectively,
to enter into this Agreement.

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each
of the Guarantors is entering into a limited guarantee in favor of the
Company (each a " _Limited Guarantee_ ") pursuant to which each of the
Guarantors is guaranteeing certain obligations of Parent and Merger Sub in
connection with this Agreement as specified and subject to the terms
and conditions therein.

WHEREAS, prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have entered into a Voting
Agreement in connection with the Merger.

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in
connection with this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the  General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will continue
its corporate existence under Delaware law as the surviving corporation in the
Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd
Street, New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on (a) the later of (i)
a date which shall be the third (3rd) Business Day after the satisfaction or
waiver in accordance with this Agreement by the party having the benefit of
the applicable condition (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied by actions to be taken at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction (or waiver in accordance with this Agreement by the party
having the benefit of the applicable condition) of all conditions at the
Closing), and (ii) the earlier of (x) a date during the Marketing Period to be
specified by Parent on no fewer than five (5) Business DaysÂ’ notice to the
Company, and (y) the third (3rd) Business Day following the final day of the
Marketing Period (subject, in the case of each of subclauses (x) and (y) of
this clause (ii), to the satisfaction (or waiver in accordance with this
Agreement by the party having the benefit of the applicable condition) of all
conditions set forth in Article VI as of the date determined pursuant to this
Section 1.2 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment (or waiver in
accordance with this Agreement by the party having the benefit of the
applicable condition) of all conditions at the Closing)), or (b) at such other
place, date and time as the Company and Parent may agree in writing;
_provided_ that the Closing Date specified in any notice delivered pursuant to
subclause (ii)(x) immediately above may be conditioned upon the simultaneous
completion of the Debt Financing, it being understood and agreed that if such
Debt Financing is not completed for any reason at such time, such notice shall
automatically be deemed withdrawn); _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that in
no event will the Closing occur during the first three (3) Business Days of a
quarter, and if the Closing would otherwise have occurred pursuant to this
Section 1.2 during such three (3) Business Day period, then the Closing will
instead occur on the fourth Business Day of such quarter ( _provided_ , for
the avoidance of doubt, the Closing at such later time shall be subject to the
satisfaction (or waiver in accordance with this Agreement by the party having
the benefit of the applicable condition) of all conditions at the Closing).
The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the "
_Closing Date_."

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, the Company will cause a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 251 of
the DGCL. The Merger will become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by the Company and
Merger Sub in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance
with the DGCL (the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



-2-  Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_. Subject to Section 5.9, at the Effective Time, (a) the
certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read
as set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto, and, as so amended, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the DGCL and such certificate of incorporation; and
(b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in
their entirety to read as set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto, and, as so
amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the DGCL and such bylaws.

Section 1.6 _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger
Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death,
incapacitation, retirement, resignation or removal.

Section 1.7 _Officers_. The officers of the Company as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, or their earlier death, incapacitation, retirement,
resignation or removal. 

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or
the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each share of common stock of the Company,
par value $0.01 per share, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (such shares, collectively, the " _Common Stock_ ," and each, a " _Share_
"), other than Shares to be cancelled or converted pursuant to Section 2.1(b)
and, other than Dissenting Shares, shall be converted automatically into and
shall thereafter represent the right to receive $46.25 in cash without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All Shares that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Section 2.1 shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the
holders of certificates or Book-Entry Shares that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.1(a) and Section 2.2 (less any
applicable withholding Taxes).

 



-3-  (b) _Company, Subsidiary, Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Share that
is owned directly by the Company (or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the
Company), Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Excluded Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and
retirement.

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and
after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of
Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(d) _Dissenters Â’ Rights_. Any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent
required thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares) and that are held by
holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have
complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders
of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled instead to receive payment of the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
such Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the
DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and had become
exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, and the Surviving Corporation
shall remain liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for such Shares.
At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the
DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company will give Parent
(i) notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of Shares and
(ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such notices and demands. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal or settle, compromise, offer to settle or compromise any such
demands.

(e) _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of shares of Common Stock, or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock, issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time, as applicable, as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange
offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration, as applicable,
shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

 



-4-  Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to or concurrently with the Closing, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company
that shall be appointed by Parent to act as a paying agent hereunder (and
which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) (the " _Paying Agent_ "),
in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares (other than the Excluded
Shares), cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares), payable upon due
surrender of the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-
Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.1(a) (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the second Business Day following the Closing Date, the
Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares were
converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a), (A) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually agree) and (B) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration to which such holder of Shares is entitled pursuant to Section
2.1(a) (less any applicable withholding Taxes).

 

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
number of Shares represented by such holderÂ’s properly surrendered
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares and (y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding
Taxes). No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash
to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented
to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable.

(iii) The Paying Agent, the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent and Merger
Sub, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise

 



-5-   payable under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),
and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, they
shall be cancelled and, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth
in Section 2.2(b), exchanged for the cash such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (less any applicable withholding Taxes) to be paid
by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by such holder.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any
former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in accordance
with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (less any applicable withholding Taxes),
without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares.

(e) _No Liability_. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by stockholders of the Company as of a date that is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent (or at ParentÂ’s election, the
Surviving Corporation) free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to Section 2.2(d).

(g) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with

 



-6-   respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the number
of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

(a) Unless otherwise agreed between Parent and a particular award holder, each
option to purchase Shares granted under a Company Equity Plan (each, a "
_Company Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time,
become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such Company Option
multiplied by (ii) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Option.
The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay
to the former holders of Company Options the cash amounts described in the
immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are required to
be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, no later than the
second payroll cycle of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective
Time.

 

(b) Except as otherwise agreed between Parent and a particular award holder,

Documents contained or, if not yet filed, will contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted or, if not yet filed, will omit to state any

financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The CompanyÂ’s disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
CompanyÂ’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding

completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the CompanyÂ’s internal
controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of

assessment concluded that such controls were effective and did not identify
any (A) "significant deficiency" or "material weakness" in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, of the Exchange Act) or (B) fraud or
allegation of fraud that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the CompanyÂ’s internal controls over financial reporting.
Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP. Since January 1, 2011, to the Knowledge of the Company, neither the
Company nor any

 



-15-   of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors of officers has

Agreement, (c) for liabilities or obligations that have been discharged or
paid in full prior to the date hereof and (d) for liabilities and obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2012, neither

obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise,

would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

Except as disclosed in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the
Company immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent
Disclosure Letter_ ") ( _provided_ , that, disclosure of any item in any
section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed
disclosed with respect to any other section or subsection only to the extent
that the relevance of any disclosed event, item or occurrence in such section
or subsection to such other section or subsection is reasonably apparent from
the substance of the disclosure made as to matters and items which are
the subject of the corresponding representation or warranty), Parent and
Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company as

Section 4.1 _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc._ Each of Parent
and Merger Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and
has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, validly
existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority,
would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay the
Closing or prevent or materially delay or materially impair the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to perform their obligations under this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (a " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ ").

 



-29-   Parent has made available to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement

Directors of Parent and Merger Sub and by Parent, as the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub, and, except for the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, no other corporate proceedings
on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub
and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of
the Company, constitutes the valid and binding agreement of Parent and Merger
Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions

other consents and/or notices set forth on Section 4.2(b) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter (collectively, clauses (i) through (vi), the " _Parent
Approvals_ "), and other than any consent, approval, authorization, permit,
action, filing or notification the failure of which to make or obtain would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) (i) contravene or conflict with the
organizational or governing documents of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) assuming compliance with the matters referenced in this Section 4.2(b)
and receipt of the Parent Approvals, contravene or conflict with or constitute
a violation of any provision of any Law binding upon or applicable to Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, or
(iii) result in any violation of, or default under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material obligation or to
the loss of a material benefit under any loan, guarantee of indebtedness or
credit agreement, note, bond, debenture, mortgage, indenture, lease,
agreement, contract, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, right or
license binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or result in the
creation

 



-30-   of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or
assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, other than, in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii), any such violation, conflict, default, termination,
cancellation, acceleration, right, loss or Lien that would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.3 _Investigations; Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no
investigation or review pending (or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened)
by any Governmental Entity with respect to any of the Guarantors, Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries which would have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, and there are no Action pending (or, to
ParentÂ’s Knowledge, threatened) against or affecting any of the Guarantors,
Parent or its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties at law or in
equity, and there are no orders, judgments or decrees of any Governmental
Entity in effect against any of the Guarantors, Parent or Merger Sub, in
each case which would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.4 _Proxy Statement; Other Information_. None of the information
provided by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will, at
the time it is filed with the SEC and at the time it is first mailed to the
stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

Section 4.5 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has received and accepted two executed commitment letters, dated as
of the date of this Agreement (as amended, modified, supplemented, replaced
or extended from time to time after the date of this Agreement in compliance
with Section 5.11(a), the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ "), from the lenders
(including any lenders who become party thereto by joinder) party thereto
(collectively, the " _Lenders_ "), pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide the debt amounts set
forth therein. The debt financing committed pursuant to the Debt Commitment
Letters is collectively referred to in this Agreement as the " _Debt
Financing_."

(b) Parent has received and accepted executed commitment letters, dated as of
the date of this Agreement (as amended from time to time after the date of
this Agreement in compliance with Section 5.11(a), the " _Equity
Commitment Letters_ " and, together with the Debt Commitment Letters, the "
_Commitment Letters_ ") from the Guarantors pursuant to which the Guarantors
have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest in Parent
the amounts set forth therein. The Equity Commitment Letters provide that the
Company is a third-party beneficiary thereof and is entitled to enforce such
agreement, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions thereof. The cash
equity committed pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letters is collectively
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Cash Equity_." The Cash Equity and the
Debt Financing are collectively referred to as the " _Financing_." Parent
has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the
executed Commitment Letters and copies of any fee or engagement letters
related to the Debt Financing (with only fee amounts, pricing caps and other
economic terms redacted (none of which would adversely affect the amount or

 



-31-   availability of the Debt Financing) (as amended, modified, supplemented,
replaced or extended from time to time after the date of this Agreement in
compliance with Section 5.11(a), the " _Fee Letters_ ").

(c) Except as expressly set forth in the copies of the Commitment Letters (or
in the unredacted portions of the Fee Letters) delivered to Parent pursuant
to Section 4.5(b), as of the date of this Agreement, there are no conditions
precedent to the obligations of the Lenders and the Guarantors to provide the
Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Lenders or the
Guarantors to reduce the total amount of the Financing. Assuming satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 and the completion
of the Marketing Period, as of the date hereof, Parent does not have any
reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all
material conditions to be satisfied by it in any of the Commitment Letters or
the Fee Letters at the time it is required to consummate the Closing
hereunder, nor does Parent have Knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement,
that any of the Lenders or Guarantors will not perform their respective
funding obligations under the Commitment Letters in accordance with
their respective terms and conditions.

(d) The Financing, together with the Funding Amount, if funded in accordance
with the Commitment Letters, shall provide Parent and Merger Sub with cash
proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient for the satisfaction of all of
ParentÂ’s and Merger SubÂ’s payment obligations under this Agreement and under
the Commitment Letters, including the payment of the Merger Consideration and
the repayment of any Indebtedness of the Company contemplated by this
Agreement and any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger, the Debt Tender Offers
and the Financing, in each case at the Closing.

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters are valid,
binding and in full force and effect (except to the extent enforcement may be
limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception) and, as of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time,
or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a
failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent under the terms
and conditions of the Commitment Letters. Parent has paid in full any and
all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms
of the Commitment Letters on or before the date of this Agreement, and will
pay in full any such amounts due on or before the Closing Date. As of the date
hereof, (i) none of the Commitment Letters has been modified, amended or
altered and (ii) none of the respective commitments under any of the
Commitment Letters have been withdrawn or rescinded.

 

Section 4.6 _Limited Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company a Limited Guarantee of each
Guarantor, duly executed by such Guarantor, with respect to certain matters,
including guaranteeing certain obligations of Parent and Merger Sub in
connection with the Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions
set forth therein. As of the date of this Agreement, each Limited Guarantee
is in full force and effect and constitutes the valid and binding obligation
of the applicable Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject
to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

 



-32-  Section 4.7 _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital stock of
Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be,
owned by Parent. Merger Sub has outstanding no option, warrant, right, or any
other agreement pursuant to which any Person other than Parent may acquire any
equity security of Merger Sub. Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior
to the date hereof and has, and prior to the Effective Time will have, no
assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to
its formation and pursuant to this Agreement, the Financing and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

Section 4.8 _No Vote of Parent Stockholders_. No vote of the stockholders of
Parent or the holders of any other securities of Parent (equity or otherwise)
is required by any applicable Law, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
or other equivalent organizational documents of Parent or the applicable rules
of any exchange on which securities of Parent are traded, in order for Parent
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 4.9 _Finders or Brokers_. Except for Qatalyst Partners, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates has employed any investment
banker, broker or finder in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement who might be entitled to any
financial advisory fee or any brokerÂ’s commission or similar fee in connection
with or upon consummation of the Merger.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges that it and its Representatives
have had an opportunity to meet with the management of the Company and to
discuss the business and assets of the Company, and that, to the Knowledge of
Parent, it and its Representatives have received access to such books and
records, facilities, equipment, contracts and other assets of the Company
which it and its Representatives have desired or requested to review.

SEC Documents, as applicable), and neither the Company, its directors,
officers, employees, agents or other representatives, nor any other Person
shall be subject to any liability to Parent or any other Person resulting from
the CompanyÂ’s making available to Parent or ParentÂ’s use of such information,
or any information, documents or material made available to Parent in the due
diligence materials provided to Parent, including in the data room, other
management presentations (formal or informal) or in any other form in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty to
Parent or Merger Sub with respect to any business or financial projection or
forecast relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
included in the data room or any management presentation.

 



-33-  Section 4.11 _Certain Arrangements_. As of the date hereof, there are
no contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements, obligations or
understandings, whether written or oral, between Parent or Merger Sub, the
Guarantors or any of their controlling or controlled Affiliates, on the one

properties, contracts, commitments, books and records, Tax Returns and
workpapers, other than any such matters that relate to the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement, or to transactions potentially competing with or
alternative to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or proposals
from other parties relating to any competing or alternative transactions. The

status of any material Tax matters that do not arise in the CompanyÂ’s or any
of its SubsidiaryÂ’s ordinary course of business. The foregoing
notwithstanding, the Company shall not be required to afford such access if
it would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, would cause a violation of any agreement to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party, would in the reasonable judgment of the

privilege or trade secret protection to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or would constitute a violation of any applicable Law, and in any such event,
the parties hereto will use their reasonable best efforts to make appropriate
substitute access arrangements in a manner that does not result in such loss
or violation.

 

(b) Parent hereby agrees that all information provided to it or any Parent
Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be Confidential

personnel of, the Company and its Subsidiaries to any Person pursuant to (x) a
confidentiality agreement having provisions as to confidential treatment of

necessary to allow such Person to make a confidential proposal to the Board of
Directors of the Company and (B) shall not include an obligation of the
Company to reimburse such PersonÂ’s expenses), or (y) to the extent
applicable, the confidentiality agreement entered into with such Person prior

within forty-eight (48) hours) make available to the Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any
Person given such access that was not previously made available to the
Parent, and (ii) engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations with any Persons or group of Persons with

three (3) Business Days after the Go-Shop Period End Date, the Company shall
provide Parent a list of Excluded Parties, including the identity of each

with respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any Alternative
Proposal, (ii) participate in any negotiations regarding an Alternative
Proposal with, or furnish any non-public information regarding the Company or
its Subsidiaries to, any Person that has made or, to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge,
is considering making an Alternative Proposal, or (iii) engage in discussions
regarding an Alternative Proposal with any Person that has made or, to the
CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, is considering making an Alternative Proposal, except to
notify such Person as to the existence of the provisions of this Section 5.3.

(d) Except as may relate to an Excluded Party (but only for so long as such
Person or group is an Excluded Party), after the Go Shop Period End Date, the
Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours of
the CompanyÂ’s knowledge of any such event) notify Parent of the receipt of any
Alternative Proposal or any inquiry, proposal, offer or request for
information with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to result
in, an Alternative Proposal, or any discussions or negotiations sought to be
initiated or continued with the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or, to the
CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, any of their Representatives concerning an
Alternative Proposal, indicating, in each case, the identity of the Person or
group making such Alternative Proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or request
for information and a copy of any Alternative Proposal made in writing and the
material terms and conditions of an Acquisition Proposal not made in writing,
and thereafter shall keep Parent informed in reasonable detail, on a prompt
basis (and, in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours of the CompanyÂ’s or
its RepresentativesÂ’ knowledge of any such event), of any material
developments or modifications to the terms of any such Alternative Proposal,
inquiry, proposal, offer or request (including copies of any written proposed
agreements) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations. The
Company hereby agrees that it shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, enter into
any agreement that prohibits or restricts it from providing to Parent the
information contemplated by this Section 5.3(d) or complying with Section
5.3(e) or Section 5.3(f).

 



-42-  (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.3 to the contrary, at any time
following the Go Shop Period End Date and prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval:

(i) if the Company receives an Alternative Proposal (provided that such
Alternative Proposal does not result from any material breach of the
restrictions in Section 5.3(c) above) which the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (A) constitutes a Superior
Proposal or (B) could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal,
the Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information
to the third party making such Alternative Proposal, if, and only if, prior to
so furnishing such information, such third party has entered into an executed
confidentiality agreement with the Company having provisions that are no less
favorable to the Company in any substantive respect than provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreements (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement (I) need not contain any "standstill" or similar provisions
or otherwise prohibit the making of or amendment to any Alternative Proposal
and (II) shall not contain an obligation of the Company to reimburse the
expenses of the counterparty), and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations
with such third party with respect to the Alternative Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall (1) immediately notify Parent (and in any
event within forty-eight (48) hours) of the determination by the Board of
Directors of the Company contemplated by this Section 5.3(e)(i), and (2)
promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) make available to
Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
that is provided to any such third party that was not previously made
available to Parent and (3) otherwise continue to comply with Section 5.3(d);
_provided_ , _further_ , that this Section 5.3(e)(i) shall not apply to
Alternative Proposals (or amendments or modifications thereto) made by
Excluded Parties prior to the Cut-off Date, which are governed by Section
5.3(a); and

(ii) if the Company receives an Alternative Proposal (provided that such
Alternative Proposal does not arise from any material breach of the
restrictions in Section 5.3(c)) that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal (taking into account any adjustment to the terms and conditions of
the Merger proposed by Parent in response to such Alternative Proposal), then,
the Board of Directors of the Company may terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.1(g) if and only if (A) the Company shall have given
written notice to Parent at least four (4) Business Days in advance to the
effect that the Company has received such Superior Proposal (a " _Superior
Proposal Notice_ "), and the Board of Directors of the Company intends to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g) unless Parent proposes
any revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that renders such
Alternative Proposal no longer a Superior Proposal, specifying the identity of
the Person or group making the Superior Proposal, and attaching a copy of all
relevant transaction agreements and other material documents relating to such
Superior Proposal (or, where no such copy is available, a description of the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal), (B) during the four
(4) Business Days following the delivery of such Superior Proposal Notice (the
" _Notice Period_ "), the Board of Directors of the Company shall and shall
cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and its Representatives
in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make adjustments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (C) upon the expiration of
the Notice Period, either (1) Parent shall not have proposed revisions to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement), or (2) if Parent within such period
shall have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, shall have

 



-43-   determined in good faith that the third partyÂ’s Alternative Proposal remains
a Superior Proposal with respect to ParentÂ’s revised proposal; _provided_ ,
that each time material modifications to the terms of an Alternative Proposal
determined to be Superior Proposal are made (it being understood any change to
the financial terms of such proposal shall be deemed a material modification),
the Company shall notify Parent of such modification and the time period set
forth in the preceding clause (B) shall be extended for three (3) Business
Days.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.3 to the contrary, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, other than in
connection with a Superior Proposal, if an Intervening Event shall have
occurred, the Board of Directors of the Company may withdraw (or qualify or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent), and exclude from the Proxy Statement,
the Recommendation solely in respect of such Intervening Event, or publicly
propose to do so, if (A) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s financial advisors and its
outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors of
the Company to effect such Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) the Company shall have
given written notice to Parent at least four (4) Business Days in advance to
the effect that an Intervening Event has occurred, specifying the facts and
circumstances of such Intervening Event in reasonable detail, and informing
Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to effect a Change
of Recommendation with respect to such Intervening Event, (C) during such
four (4) Business Day period, the Board of Directors of the Company shall and
shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to
make adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (D) upon
the expiration of such four (4) Business Day period, the Board of Directors of
the Company, after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, shall have determined in good faith that, after taking
into account proposed revisions (if any) by Parent to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation with
respect to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company shall deliver a new
written notice to Parent in accordance with clause (B) above in connection
with any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such
Intervening Event and comply again with the requirements of clauses (C) and
(D) above.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
(ii) issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position thereunder or (iii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel, that the failure of the
Board of Directors of the Company to make such disclosure would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ exercise of their fiduciary
obligations to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in any event the Board of Directors of the Company shall not
effect a Change of Recommendation except in accordance with Section 5.3(f).
Any public disclosure (other than any "stop, look and listen" statement) by
the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof relating to any
determination or other action by the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof with respect to any Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to
be a Change of Recommendation unless the Board of Directors of the Company
expressly publicly reaffirms its Recommendation in such disclosure.

 



-44-  (h) Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Article VII, (i) the approval of the CompanyÂ’s
Board of Directors for purposes of causing any Takeover Statutes and the
Rights Plan to be inapplicable to the Merger and other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall not be amended and no Change of
Recommendation or other action shall change such approval, and (ii) except as
set forth on Section 5.3(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Rights Plan
shall not be amended or qualified. 

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, at any time after the Go-Shop Period End Date
and until the date which is ten (10) days after the Go-Shop Period End Date
(the " _Cut-off Date_ "), the Company may continue to engage in the activities
described in Section 5.3(a) with respect to, and the restrictions in Section
5.3(b) and Section 5.3(c) shall not apply to, any Excluded Party (but only
for so long as such Person or group is an Excluded Party), including with
respect to any amended or modified Alternative Proposal submitted by any
Excluded Party following the Go-Shop Period End Date. 

(j) The Company may fail to enforce or waive any standstill or similar
provision in any confidentiality agreement it has entered into with any
Person, whether prior to or after the date hereof, solely to the extent
necessary to allow a Person to make a confidential proposal to the Board of
Directors of the Company.

Alternative Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act within
ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such Alternative Proposal.

fide proposal or offer made by any Person (other than Parent and its
Affiliates) for (i) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar

beneficially owning more than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding equity

acquisition by any Person (including by any asset acquisition, joint venture

income of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, (iii) any
acquisition (including by tender or exchange offer) by any Person that if

(n) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a bona fide
written Alternative Proposal, substituting "fifty percent (50%)" for each
reference to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Alternative

not result from or arise in connection with any material breach of Section
5.3(c), that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, and taking into account all of the terms and conditions the CompanyÂ’s
Board of Directors considers to be appropriate (after taking into account any
revisions to the terms and conditions to this Agreement made or proposed and
committed to in writing by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal), (i)
to be more favorable to the Company and its stockholders than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if such Alternative
Proposal is from a financial sponsor or group of financial sponsors, a Person
or group that includes one or more financial sponsors, a Person or group that
proposes to obtain a material portion of its financing from one or more

to be made no later than two (2) Business Days after the Go-Shop Period End
Date), after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, is
or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , (x) any Person shall immediately and irrevocably cease to be an
Excluded Party if, at any time after the No Shop Period End Date, the
Alternative Proposal submitted by such Person is withdrawn or terminated and
(y) any group of Persons and any member of such group shall immediately and
irrevocably cease to be an Excluded Party if, at any time after the No Shop

percent (50%) of the equity financing of such group.

 

Section 5.4 _Filings; Other Actions_.

(a) The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement as
soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, which shall include,
subject to Section 5.3, the Recommendation. The Company shall use all
reasonable efforts to (1) cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act applicable
thereto as of the date of such filing and (2) respond to any comments by the
SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement. Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide to the Company

 



-46-   such information as the Company may reasonably request for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement. The Company will (i) use its reasonable best efforts to have
the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable following
its filing with the SEC. The Company shall, and, if applicable, shall cause
its Representatives to, promptly after receipt thereof, provide Parent copies
of all written comments, and advise Parent of all oral comments, with respect
to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC). The
Company shall, and, if applicable, shall cause its Representatives to, provide
Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company, on the one
hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) on the other hand. Prior to filing
or mailing the Proxy Statement (including any amendment or supplement thereto)
or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with
respect thereto, the Company shall provide, and, if applicable, cause its
Representatives to provide, Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and
propose comments on such Proxy Statement (or such amendment or supplement
thereto) or response to the SEC or NASDAQ and shall in good faith consider
such comments reasonably proposed by Parent for inclusion therein. If, at any
time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set
forth in an amendment to the Proxy Statement so that such document would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, then the party hereto
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto
and, to the extent required by Law, the Company shall promptly file with the
SEC and disseminate the holders of Common Stock an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information.

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the
SEC (i) take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law
(including the DGCL) and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the
rules of NASDAQ to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval (the " _Company Meeting_ "), and (ii) subject to a Change of
Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.3, use all reasonable best efforts
to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of the
adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Change of Recommendation shall obviate or otherwise
affect the obligation of the Company to duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Company Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval in accordance with this Section 5.4.

(c) The Company will deliver to Parent an affidavit, dated within 30 days of
the Closing Date and in accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections
1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h), certifying that each "interest" in the Company
(within the meaning of Section 897(c)(1) of the Code) is not a "United States
real property interest" within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code.

 



-47-  Section 5.5 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From the Effective Time through March 31, 2014 (or, if earlier, the date
of termination of the relevant employee), the Surviving Corporation shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ") (i) base compensation
and non-equity-based bonus opportunities that, in each case, are no less
favorable than were provided to the applicable Company Employee immediately
before the Effective Time and (ii) non-equity based employee benefits that are
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to the applicable Company
Employee immediately before the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide to each Company Employee whose employment is
terminated without Cause during the one-year period following the Effective
Time or who voluntarily terminates employment during such period pursuant to a
Constructive Termination, cash severance in a lump sum amount no lower than
the applicable amount determined in accordance with the matrix set forth in
Section 5.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company
Employees after the Effective Time (including with respect to severance
provided consistent with the matrix set forth on Section 5.5(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her
years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply for any purpose
with respect to any defined benefit pension plan or any equity-based or
nonqualified deferred compensation plan or arrangement, or to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits or compensation. In
addition, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time, and
(ii) for purposes of each plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee that replaces a comparable
Company Benefit Plan in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs (a "
_New Plan_ "), Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in
which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the comparable
Company Benefit Plan ending on the date such employeeÂ’s participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents
for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance
with such New Plan.

 



-48-  (c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar
phrase) within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at or
prior to the Effective Time, as applicable.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company (the " _Committee_ ") shall have the authority to (i)
determine and certify the achievement of performance goals under the Amended
and Restated BMC Software, Inc. Short-Term Incentive Performance Award
Program in respect of the performance period in which the Effective Time
occurs; _provided_ , that such determination shall only apply to performance
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) certify the achievement of performance
goals under the same program in respect of performance period(s) completed
prior to the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to
honor any such determinations and certifications. 

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.5 or any other provision of this
Agreement (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit
or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement,
(ii) shall limit the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including,
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries)
to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement, contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed, established,
sponsored or maintained by any of them, or (iii) create any third-party
beneficiary rights or obligations in any person (including any Company
Employee) other than the parties to this Agreement or any right to employment
or continued employment or to a particular term or condition of employment
with Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries).

cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate

any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents,

to pay any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party for any
consent or approval required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any contract or agreement.

 



-49-  (b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company, its Subsidiaries, Parent and Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause the Guarantors to, (i) promptly, but in no event later
than twenty (20) Business Days after the date hereof, file any and all

Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and use
their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act, (ii) use
their respective reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (x)
determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents,
permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals, and expirations or

parties or Governmental Entities in connection with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and (y) promptly making all such filings and timely obtaining all such
consents, permits, authorizations or approvals, (iii) supply to any
Governmental Entity as promptly as practicable any additional information or
documents that may be requested pursuant to any Law or by such Governmental
Entity, and (iv) if a Government Entity required to grant a clearance or
approval required to satisfy Section 6.1(b) (as it relates to the condition in
Section 6.1(c) and/or Section 6.3(e)), Section 6.1(c), and/or Section 6.3(e)
of this Agreement objects in writing to the Merger, or an authorized
representative of such Governmental Entity indicates a reasonable likelihood
of objecting to the Merger, on the basis of the participation of any
Guarantor, then Parent shall, and Parent shall cause each of the Guarantors
to, upon notice from the Company, use its reasonable best efforts promptly to
(x) contact (as coordinated by Parent) up to ten (10) potential investors
(including up to five (5) identified by the Company) in the aggregate for
Parent and all of the Guarantors to solicit their interest in replacing such
Guarantor on the same terms as are applicable to such Guarantor, (y) provide
reasonable information of Parent and the Company and engage in good faith
discussions with such potential investors regarding the CompanyÂ’s business, in
each case subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement, and (z) cause
a potential investor(s) to replace such Guarantor as promptly as practicable
to enable the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(b) (as it relates to the
condition in Section 6.1(c) and/or Section 6.3(e)), Section 6.1(c), and/or
Section 6.3(e) to be satisfied prior to the End Date; _provided_ that
notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, Parent shall be entitled
in its sole discretion to determine whether to permit any such potential
investor to replace such Guarantor and in no event shall the failure to
replace such Guarantor constitute a breach of any provision of this Agreement;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
5.6(a), this Section 5.6(b), Section 5.6(d) or elsewhere in this Agreement,
but subject to Section 5.6(c), in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub, any
Guarantor or any of their respective Affiliates, be obligated in connection
with the receipt of any consent, permit, authorization, ruling, waiver,
clearance, approval, expiration or termination of any waiting period from any
Governmental Entity or required under applicable Law, to propose or agree to
accept any undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to
make any divestiture or accept any operational restriction, or take or commit
to make payments or enter into any commercial arrangement, or commit, or
commit to take, any action which action limits the freedom of action of
Parent, Merger Sub, any Guarantor or any of their respective Affiliates with
respect to its or the CompanyÂ’s businesses, product lines or assets.

(c) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use, and Parent shall
cause the Guarantors to use, their respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain a written notification issued by the Committee on Foreign Investment
in the United States (" _CFIUS_ ")

 



-50-   that it has concluded a review of the notification voluntarily provided
pursuant to the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, and determined not
to conduct a full investigation or, if a full investigation is deemed to be
required, notification that the U.S. government will not take action to
prevent the transactions contemplated hereby from being consummated (such
notification, the " _CFIUS Approval_ "). Such reasonable best efforts shall
include promptly making any pre-notification and notification filings required
in connection with the CFIUS Approval, furnishing all information specified by
regulation to be included in a joint voluntary notice to CFIUS, and using
reasonable best efforts to provide any information requested by CFIUS or the
Defense Security Service in connection with its review of the transactions
contemplated hereby. With respect to obtaining CFIUS Approval, the
term "reasonable best efforts" shall be interpreted in light of past CFIUS
reviews and investigations relating to Government of Singapore Investment
Corporation Pte Ltd.

(d) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate and consult with each
other in connection with the making of all registrations, filings,
notifications, communications, submissions, and any other material actions
pursuant to this Section 5.6, and subject to applicable legal limitations and
the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall keep each other apprised of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, from any third

Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall
permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to review in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection
with, any proposed notifications or filings and any written communications or
submissions, and with respect to any such notification, filing, written
communication or submission, any documents submitted therewith to any
Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted
(x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the businesses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, or proposals from third parties with respect
thereto, (y) as necessary to comply with contractual agreements, and (z)
as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees not to, and Parent shall
cause the Guarantors not to, participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion, either in Person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited or requested otherwise by
such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.6, but subject to Section 5.6(b) and Section
5.6(c), if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any
proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement including as violative of any Law,
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate in all respects
with each other and shall use, and Parent shall (in the case of a challenge
based upon any Regulatory Law) cause any Guarantor party to such action or
proceeding to use, their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and
resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or

 



-51-   overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.6 shall limit a partyÂ’s
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or Section
7.1(c) so long as such party has, prior to such termination, complied with its
obligations under this Section 5.6. The parties hereto agree that all
obligations of the Company, its Subsidiaries, Parent and Merger Sub relating
to efforts to obtain the Financing are set forth exclusively in Section 5.11
and not this Section 5.6.

Section 5.7 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "interested person" "interested stockholder," "business
combination" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation or Law,
including Section 203 of the DGCL (" _Takeover Statutes_ ") shall become
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub and the members of their respective Boards of Directors
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary
so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub will
consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon
any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance
of such press release or other public statement or comment relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such
press release or other public statement or comment prior to such consultation
except as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or as may be requested
by a Governmental Entity; _provided_ that the restrictions in this Section
5.8 shall not apply to any Company communication regarding an Alternative
Proposal or a Change of Recommendation. Parent and the Company agree to issue
a joint press release announcing this Agreement.

 

Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the
current or former directors or officers, as the case may be, of the Company
or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents or in any
indemnification agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect. For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the CompanyÂ’s and
any Company SubsidiaryÂ’s certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with
any of their respective directors or officers as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or
former directors or officers of the

 



-52-   Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights
to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim
made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action
or resolution of such claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance
with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section
5.9.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under
the DGCL, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each
of the foregoing, subject to the undertaking described below) each current and
former director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each
Person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise at the CompanyÂ’s request (each, together
with such PersonÂ’s heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneysÂ’ fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL following receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
such Person to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that such
Person was not entitled to indemnification under this Section 5.9),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, charge, action,
suit, litigation, proceeding, audit or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising
out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or
alleged to have occurred whether before or after the Effective Time (including
acts or omissions in connection with such Persons serving as an officer,
director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request
or for the benefit of the Company). In the event of any such Action, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in
the defense of any such Action.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay
annual premiums in excess of 350% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be
obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount. At the CompanyÂ’s option, the Company
may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six (6)-year prepaid "tail"
policy on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as
the current policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering
without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby. If such tail prepaid
policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its
full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase
or pay for insurance hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not spend more than 350% of the last annual premium paid by the Company
prior to the date hereof (the " _Base Amount_ ") in respect of such "tail"
policy, and if the cost of such policy would otherwise exceed the Base Amount,
the Company shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for the
Base Amount.

 



-53-  (d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneysÂ’
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.9 (subject to the
undertaking described in Section 5.9(b)).

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organization
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The
provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties.

(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.9.

 

Section 5.10 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the CompanyÂ’s operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

Section 5.11 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the proceeds of the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters,
including (i) maintaining in effect the Commitment Letters in accordance with
their terms, (ii) negotiating definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing (the " _Definitive Agreements_ ") consistent with the terms and
conditions contained therein (including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions
contained in any related Fee Letter) and (iii) satisfying (or obtaining the
waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions in the Commitment Letters and the
Definitive Agreements and complying in all material respects with its
obligations thereunder. In the event that all conditions contained in the
Commitment Letters (other than, with respect to the Debt Financing,
the availability of the Cash Equity) have been satisfied and Parent is
required to consummate the Closing pursuant to Section 1.2, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause each Lender and shall cause each Guarantor to
fund its respective committed portion of the Financing required to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and
expenses on the Closing Date (including by promptly commencing a litigation
proceeding against any breaching Lender or Guarantor to compel such breaching
Lender or Guarantor to provide its respective committed portion of the
Financing, provided that Parent shall control all aspects of such proceeding,
including litigation strategy and selection of counsel). Parent shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Company, permit any amendment or
modification to,

 



-54-   or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, or voluntarily
replace (it being understood that any Alternative Debt Financing shall not be
deemed a voluntary replacement for purposes of the sentence), any Commitment
Letters or Fee Letters if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy or
voluntary replacement (w) adds new (or adversely modifies any existing)
conditions to the consummation of the Financing as compared to those in the
Commitment Letters and Fee Letters as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
(x) adversely affects the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against
other parties to the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements as
so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the
ability of Parent to enforce its rights against such other parties to the
Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof or in the Definitive
Agreements, (y) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing, or (z) would
or would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement when required pursuant to Section 1.2; _provided_ , that for the
avoidance of doubt no consent from the Company shall be required for: (A) any
amendment, replacement, supplement or modification of the Debt Commitment
Letters that is limited to adding lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt
Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement (including in replacement
of a Lender) or (B) implementation or exercise of any "flex" provisions
provided in the Fee Letters as in effect as of the date hereof. In the event
that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the
reason therefor (other (i) than a breach by the Company of this Agreement
which prevents or renders impracticable the consummation of the Financing or
(2) the termination of one, but only one, of the Debt Commitment Letters on or
prior to June 5, 2013 pursuant to the terms of thereof) Parent will (1) use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (the "
_Alternative Debt Financing_ ") (in an amount sufficient, when taken together
with Cash Equity, the Funding Amount, and any then-available Debt Financing

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and
expenses earned, due and payable as of the Closing Date) on substantially
equivalent or more favorable terms in the aggregate from the same or other
sources and which do not include any incremental conditionality to the
consummation of such alternative debt financing that are more onerous to
Parent (in the aggregate) than the conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters in effect as of the date of this Agreement and (2) promptly
notify the Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor; provided
that in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent required by

such GuarantorsÂ’ Commitment, (B) pay any fees in excess of those contemplated
by the Financing Commitments, or (C) agree to conditionality or economic terms

be permitted to disclose Confidential Information to potential debt financing
sources and their Representatives without the prior written consent of the
Company if such potential debt financing sources and their Representatives

Notes Indenture, the CompanyÂ’s 4.25% Notes due 2022 issued pursuant to the

_Indentures_ ", as applicable), on such terms and conditions, including
pricing terms, that are proposed, from time to time by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company, to be consummated after the Effective Time) (each a
" _Debt Tender Offer_ " and collectively, including the Consent
Solicitations, the " _Debt Tender Offers_ ") and Parent shall assist the
Company in connection therewith; _provided_ that the Company shall not be
required to commence any Debt Tender Offer until Parent shall have
provided the Company with the necessary offer to purchase, related letter of
transmittal, supplemental indenture and other related documents in connection
with such Debt Tender Offer (the " _Debt Tender Offer Documents_ ");
_provided_   _further_ that Parent will consult with the Company regarding

Effective Time (and shall occur after the Effective Time), and the

Offer to close after the Effective Time; _provided_ that the consummation of
any of the Debt Tender Offer shall not be a condition to Closing. None of the
Existing Notes shall be required to be purchased until after the Effective
Time. Concurrent with or immediately following the Effective Time, and in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Tender Offer, the Surviving Corporation
shall accept for purchase and purchase each series of Existing Notes properly
tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Debt Tender Offer. The Company
shall provide and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
respective Representatives to, 

 



-61-   provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with
the Debt Tender Offers; _provided_ that such cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company. The Company shall not
be required to consummate the Debt Tender Offers at or prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , following a written request from Parent to do
so, the Company may at or prior to the Effective Time in its sole discretion
consummate the Debt Tender Offers and, if the Company does consummate the Debt
Tender Offers following such request from Parent, then all such amounts paid
to consummate the Debt Tender Offers shall be added to the Available Funds

(b) The Debt Tender Offers shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1
promulgated under the Exchange Act (" _Rule 14e-1_ "), the Trust Indenture Act
of 1939, as amended (the " _TIA_ "), and any other applicable Law, it being
understood that the Company shall not be required to take any action that, in
the judgment of the Company, does not comply with Rule 143-1, the TIA or other
applicable Law. Promptly following the expiration of the Consent
Solicitation, assuming the requisite consent from the holders of the Existing
Notes (including from persons holding proxies from such holders) has been
received, the Company shall cause appropriate supplemental indentures (the "
_Supplemental Indentures_ ") to become effective providing for the amendments
of the applicable Indenture contemplated in the Debt Tender Offer Documents;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the fact that a Supplemental
Indenture may become effective earlier, the proposed amendments set forth
therein shall not become operative unless and until the Effective Time has
occurred and all conditions to the Debt Tender Offer have been satisfied or
(subject to approval by Parent) waived by the Company in accordance with the
terms hereof. The form and substance of the Supplemental Indentures shall be
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company.

(c) The Company shall waive any of the conditions to any Debt Tender Offer as
may be reasonably requested by Parent (other than the conditions that any Debt
Tender Offer is conditioned on the Effective Time occurring as provided in
Section 5.17(a)), so long as such waivers would not cause any Debt Tender
Offer to violate the Exchange Act, the TIA, or any other applicable Law, and
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, waive any condition
to any Debt Tender Offer or make any change, amendment or modification to the
terms and conditions of any Debt Tender Offer (including any extension
thereof) other than as agreed between Parent and the Company or as required in
the reasonable judgment of the Company to comply with applicable Law.

(d) With respect to any series of Existing Notes, if requested by Parent in
writing, in lieu of commencing a Debt Tender Offer for such series (or in
addition thereto), the Company shall (i)(A) promptly deliver a notice with
respect to a Change of Control Offer (as defined in the relevant
Indenture) (" _Change of Control Offer_ ") for the repurchase, on and subject
to the occurrence of a Change of Control Payment Date (as defined in the
relevant Indenture) to be mutually agreed by Parent and Company, all of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes of any such series,
pursuant to Section 4.2 of each such Indenture and the other provisions of
each such Indenture applicable thereto, and (B) otherwise comply with the
relevant Indenture with respect to each such Change of Control Offer, or (ii)
take any actions reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the satisfaction
and/or discharge of such Existing Notes by the Surviving Corporation on or
following the Effective Time pursuant to Article VIII of each

 



-62-   Indenture and the other provisions of such Indentures (it being understood
that in no event shall the Company be required to deliver any notices to
redeem, repurchase, satisfy or discharge any Existing Notes which notice is
not revocable or conditional on the occurrence of the Effective Time).

(e) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses
incurred by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the Debt Tender
Offer, Change of Control Offer or other actions described in Section 5.17(d)
in respect of any series of Notes. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Company, its subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors and
each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section
20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all damages suffered or
incurred by them in connection with any actions taken pursuant to this Section
5.17; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not have any obligation to
indemnify and hold harmless any such party or person to the extent any such
damages suffered or incurred arose from disclosure regarding the Company that
is determined to have contained a material misstatement or omission or due
to the gross or negligent misconduct of the Company.

Section 3.2(e), Section 3.2(f) and Section 3.2(g)), Section 3.9(d) and
Section 3.9(g) would cause the aggregate amount required to be paid by Parent
or Merger Sub pursuant to Article II to increase by $12,500,000 or more, such
inaccuracy or inaccuracies will be considered more than "de minimis" and such
condition will be deemed not to have been satisfied.

 

(b) The Company shall have performed in all material respects all obligations
and complied in all material respects with all covenants required by this
Agreement to be performed or complied with by it at or prior to the Closing.

(c) The Company shall have delivered to Parent a certificate, dated as of the

(d) The amount of Available Funds is equal to or greater than the Funding
Amount as of the opening of business (New York time) on the Closing Date.

Section 6.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. Neither the Company nor
Parent may rely, either as a basis for not consummating the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or terminating this
Agreement and abandoning the Merger, on the failure of any condition set forth
in Section 6.1, Section 6.2 or Section 6.3, as the case may be, to be
satisfied if such failure was caused by such partyÂ’s material breach of any
provision of this Agreement.

thirty (30) days following ParentÂ’s delivery of written notice to the Company

not been satisfied.

(i) (A) after the date of this Agreement, any Alternative Proposal

(ii) Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(f)(i); or

 

(iii) the Company shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section

then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent (or one of its
designees) (x) a fee of $210,000,000 in cash; _provided_ , that if such fee
is payable in connection with a termination of this Agreement on or prior to
the Cut-off Date (or, in the event an Alternative Proposal is made less than
four (4) full Business Days prior to the Cut-off Date by a Person or group
that at such time is an Excluded Party and the Company has delivered a
Superior Proposal Notice to Parent in respect of such Alternative Proposal
pursuant to Section 5.3(e)(ii) prior to the Cut-off Date, terminated within
one (1) Business Day following the four (4) Business-Day period or, if
applicable, any subsequent three (3) Business Day period, referred to in
Section 5.3(e)(ii)) by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(g) with respect to
the Company entering into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with a Person
or group that is an Excluded Party at the time of such termination, then, the

"), less (y) the amount of any expense reimbursement amount paid to Parent
pursuant to Section 7.3(b), if any, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Parent, such payment to be made, in the
case of a termination referenced in clause (i) above, upon such entry or
consummation of the Qualifying Transaction (regardless of whether the
Qualifying Transaction was consummated within twelve (12) months after the
termination of this Agreement), in the case of clause (ii) above, within two
(2) Business Days of such termination or, in the case of clause (iii) above,
prior to or concurrently with the termination by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(g); it being understood that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
7.1(d), then the Company shall reimburse Parent for all reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants,
investment banks, advisors and consultants to Parent, Merger Sub or the
Guarantors, and all out-of-pocket fees and expenses of Financing sources for
which Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantors may be responsible) incurred
by Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors or their respective Affiliates in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount shall not be greater than $25,000,000 by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Parent within two (2) Business
Days of such termination. Except as set forth in Section 8.5, ParentÂ’s right
to receive the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(a), in
circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is payable, shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of the Company
Related Parties for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Merger to be

 



-68-   consummated, or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise,

and any of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereunder.

Company a fee (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") in an amount equal to
$420,000,000), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Company within two (2) Business Days of such termination (it
being understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if Parent
fails to effect the Closing when required by Section 1.2 for any or no reason
or otherwise breaches this Agreement (whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise) or fails to perform hereunder (whether
willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), then (x) a decree or
order of specific performance or an injunction or injunctions or other
equitable relief if and solely to the extent permitted by Section 8.5 or (y)

Guarantee (in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof) with respect
thereto), shall be the sole and exclusive remedies (whether at law, in equity,

connection therewith or related thereto, and in no event shall the Company (or
any other Person) seek or be entitled to multiple, special or punitive
damages against the Non-Recourse Persons, or any recovery, judgment or damages
of any kind against the Non-Recourse Persons (other than against a Guarantor
