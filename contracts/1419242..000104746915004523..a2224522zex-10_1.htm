 **RECITALS**

 



 

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Seller is the record and beneficial owner
of 100% of the authorized, issued and outstanding membership interests in
TerraForm AP Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " **
_Target_** "), and the direct or indirect record and beneficial owner of the

"); and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Seller desires to sell to the Buyer, and the Buyer desires to

subject to the conditions set forth herein.

 



 

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the Parties intending to be legally bound hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I. 
DEFINITIONS**

 



 

1.1 **_Definitions_**. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement have the
meanings ascribed to them by definition in this Agreement or in _Annex A_
hereto.

 



 

1.2 **_Construction_**. All article, section, subsection, other subdivision,
annex, schedule (including the Seller Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule, as applicable), and exhibit references used in this
Agreement are to articles, sections, subsections, other subdivisions, annexes,
schedules (including the Seller Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule, as applicable) and exhibits to this Agreement unless otherwise
specified. The Seller Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer Disclosure Schedule
attached to this Agreement constitute a part of this Agreement and are
incorporated herein for all purposes. If a term is defined as one part of
speech (such as a noun), it shall have a corresponding meaning when used as
another part of speech (such as a verb). Unless the context of this Agreement
clearly requires otherwise, (a) the singular shall include the plural and the
plural shall include the singular wherever and as often as may be appropriate,
(b) the use of any gender herein shall be deemed to include the other genders,
(c) the words "include", "includes" or "including" shall be deemed to be
followed by the phrase "without limitation," (d) the words "hereof," "hereby,"
"herein," "hereunder" and similar terms in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not

 



      
 

 



 

any particular section or article in which such words appear, and (e) any
reference to any Law (or any section or other provision of any Law) means such
Law (or such section or provision) as amended, modified, codified, replaced or
reenacted, in whole or in part, and in effect from time to time. Currency
amounts referenced herein, unless otherwise specified, are in United States
Dollars. Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of days, such number shall
refer to calendar days unless Business Days are specified. All accounting
terms used herein and not expressly defined herein shall have the respective
meanings given to them under GAAP.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II. 
PURCHASE AND SALE OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS**

 



 

2.1 **_Purchase and Sale of the Membership Interests_** **.** Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, the
Seller shall sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to the Buyer the
Membership Interests free and clear of all Liens (other than Liens arising
under applicable securities Laws), and the Buyer shall purchase and accept
from the Seller, the Membership Interests.

 



 

2.2 **_Purchase Price_** **.**

 



 

(a) The aggregate consideration to be paid by the Buyer to the Seller for the
Membership Interests (" ** _Purchase Price_** ") shall be an amount in cash
equal to the sum of Three Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($350,000,000), plus
the net result of (i) either adding the Lock-Box Adjustment if it is a
positive number or subtracting the absolute value of the Lock-Box Adjustment
if it is a negative number and (ii) adding either the Working Capital Overage,
if any, or the Working Capital Underage, if any, as determined for the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the receipt
by the APT Entities and Minority-Interest Entities of all revenues received in
the Ordinary Course of Business will not be included in the calculation of
Lock-Box Contributions.

 



 

(b) The Buyer shall pay to the Seller the Purchase Price on the Closing Date
by wire transfer in immediately available funds to such account as the Seller
designates in writing to the Buyer at least three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date.

 



 

2.3 **_Determination of Purchase Price_** **.**

 



 

(a) At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
shall deliver to the Buyer a certificate setting forth an estimate of the
Purchase Price, which shall include the Sellers calculation of the Lock-Box
Adjustment, if any, along with any supporting work papers and documentation
evidencing any transactions during the Lock-Box Period deemed to constitute a
Lock-Box Contribution or Lock-Box Distribution, and the Sellers calculation
of any Working Capital Overage or Working Capital Underage, as applicable,
(the " ** _Working Capital Estimate_** " and, collectively with the Lock-Box
Adjustment, the " ** _Adjustment Amount Estimate_** "). Such certificate shall
be prepared by the Seller in good faith and be accompanied by reasonably
detailed supporting documentation. Within five (5) Business Days after the
delivery of the Adjustment Amount Estimate by the Seller to the Buyer, the
Buyer may object in good faith to the Adjustment Amount Estimate in writing.
If the Buyer objects to the Adjustment Amount Estimate within such five (5)
Business Day period, the Parties shall attempt

 



      
 

 



 

to resolve their differences by negotiation. If the Parties are unable to do
so prior to the Closing Date (or if the Buyer does not object to the
Adjustment Amount Estimate), the Purchase Price shall be adjusted at Closing
by the amount of the Adjustment Amount Estimate not in dispute. The disputed
portion shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of _Section
2.3(c)_ and paid as part of any Final Statement.

 



 

(b) The " ** _Adjustment Amount_** " equals the sum of (i) Working Capital
Overage or Working Capital Underage, as the case may be, and (ii) the
difference between the Lock-Box Adjustment paid at the Closing and any
adjustment thereto pursuant to this _Section 2.3_. Within sixty (60) days
after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller (i) a statement
setting forth a consolidated balance sheet of the Target as of the Economic
Interests Closing Date prepared in accordance with GAAP and the Sellers
historic practices applied on the same basis as applied in the preparation of
the Working Capital Estimate and (ii) a statement showing in reasonable detail
its calculation of Working Capital as of the Economic Interests Closing Date,
its calculation of all Lock-Box Contributions and Lock-Box Distributions (if
different from the Sellers), and its calculation of any Adjustment Amount,
together with supporting work papers (the " ** _Adjustment Statement_** ") as
of such Economic Interests Closing Date. The Adjustment Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP and the Sellers historic practices applied
on the same basis as applied in the preparation of the Working Capital
Estimate.

 



 

(c) During the forty-five (45) day period following the Sellers receipt of
the Adjustment Statement, the Seller and its advisors (including accountants)
shall be provided access to the relevant books, records and employees of the
APT Entities and the Minority-Interest Entities (to the extent in the Buyers
possession or control) to the extent required in connection with their review
of and any dispute with respect to the Adjustment Statement and the Buyer
shall furnish the Seller with any other information that might be relevant to
the calculation of the Adjustment Amount; _provided_ that the Seller and its
advisors (including accountants) shall have executed all release letters
reasonably requested by the Buyers accountants in connection therewith. The
Adjustment Statement shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the
expiration of such forty-five (45) day period, unless the Seller gives written
notice of its specific disagreement with respect to such Adjustment Statement
(a " ** _Notice of Disagreement_** ") to the Buyer prior to such date (the "
** _Review Period_** "). Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted, along with a
calculation and amount of the disputed item. Any items on the Adjustment
Statement as to which the Seller has not given notice of objection will be
deemed to have been agreed upon by the Parties. If a Notice of Disagreement is
delivered to the Buyer within the Review Period with respect to the Adjustment
Statement, then such Adjustment Statement (as revised in accordance with this
sentence) shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the earlier of
(A) the Buyer and the Seller resolving in writing any differences they have
with respect to the matters specified in the applicable Notice of Disagreement
and (B) the date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the
Accountant in accordance with this _Section 2.3_. During the fifteen (15) day
period following the delivery of the Notice of Disagreement, the Buyer and the
Seller shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that
they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement and any resolution of the Parties during such time will be final
and binding. If any items remain in dispute at the end of such fifteen (15)
day period, the Parties shall, within fifteen (15) days, submit to the
Accountant for

 



     

 



 

arbitration, in accordance with this _Section 2.3(c)_, only matters that
remain in dispute and were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement in
accordance with this _Section 2.3(c)_, in the form of a written brief. In the
event that either Party fails to submit its brief regarding items in dispute
within such time period, then the Accountant shall render a decision based
solely on the evidence timely submitted by the other Party. The Accountant
shall be a nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall
be reasonably agreed upon by the Buyer and the Seller in writing. The Buyer or
the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accountant
to render a written decision resolving the matters submitted to the Accountant
within fourteen (14) days of the receipt of such submission. The scope of the
disputes to be resolved by the Accountant shall be limited to determining only
those items in dispute. The Accountants decision shall be based solely on
written submissions by the Buyer and the Seller and their respective
Representatives and not by independent review. The Accountant shall not hold
any hearings, hear any oral testimony or otherwise seek or require any other
evidence. The Accountant may not assign a value greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by any Party or smaller than the smallest value
for such item claimed by a Party. The resolution of disputed items by the
Accountant shall constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and non-
appealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having
jurisdiction thereover. The Accountant shall also determine, as part of such
dispute resolution, the respective liability of the Buyer and the Seller as to
payment of the costs and expenses of such Accountant, based on the following
formula: the Buyer and the Seller shall each pay the percentage of the costs
and expenses of the Accountant in settling the disputed matters set forth in
the Notice of Disagreement equal to (i) the aggregate amount of such disputed
matters (as determined by reference to the potential impact of such disputed
matters on the Purchase Price) submitted to the Accountant that are
unsuccessfully disputed by such Party (as finally determined by the
Accountant) _divided by_ (ii) the aggregate amount of all such disputed
matters (as determined by reference to the potential impact of such disputed
matters on the Purchase Price) submitted to the Accountant. The Parties shall
cooperate with each other and the Accountant regarding the resolution of any
disagreement with respect to the Adjustment Statement, such cooperation to
include reasonable access to books, records, facilities and personnel. This
provision shall constitute the exclusive remedy of the Parties with respect to
determination of the Final Statement. A " ** _Final Statement_** " shall be,
with respect to the Adjustment Statement: (i) such Adjustment Statement if no
Notice of Disagreement is delivered to the Buyer during the Review Period or
(ii) such Adjustment Statement as adjusted by (A) the written agreement of the
Buyer and the Seller or (B) the Accountant in accordance with this _Section
2.3_.

 



 

(d) If the Adjustment Amount as set forth on the Final Statement is greater
than the Adjustment Amount Estimate applicable to such Final Statement, the
Buyer shall, within ten (10) Business Days after such Final Statement becomes
final and binding on the Parties, make payment of such difference to the
Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds as the Seller may
direct together with interest of the amount of such difference at the Default
Interest Rate accruing from the Closing Date to the date of payment. If the
Adjustment Amount as set forth on a Final Statement is less than the
Adjustment Amount Estimate applicable to such Final Statement, then the Seller
shall, within ten (10) Business Days after such Final Statement becomes final
and binding on the Parties, make payment to the Buyer by wire transfer of
immediately available funds of the amount of such difference, together with
interest of the amount of such difference at the Default Interest Rate
accruing from the Closing Date to the date of payment.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Following the Closing through the date the Adjustment Statement or Final
Statement becomes final and binding on the Parties, the Buyer shall not take
any action with respect to the accounting books and records of the Target, or
the items reflected thereon, on which such Adjustment Statement is to be
based, that is inconsistent with Sellers past practices. During the period of
time from and after the Closing Date through the date the Adjustment Statement
becomes final and binding on the Parties, the Buyer shall afford, and shall
cause the Target to afford, the Seller and any of their accountants, counsel
or financial advisors retained in connection with the determination of the
applicable Adjustment Amount in accordance with this _Section 2.3_, upon
reasonable notice and at reasonable times and in such manner as will not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Target or any
of the APT Entities or Minority-Interest Entities, direct access during normal
business hours to all the books, contracts, personnel, Representatives
(including the Targets accountants) and records of the Target and such
Representatives (including the work papers of the Targets accountants)
relevant to the preparation of the Adjustment Statement, and the determination
of the Adjustment Amount in accordance with this _Section 2.3_ as Seller
reasonably requests; _provided_ that (i) the Seller and its advisors
(including accountants) shall have executed all release letters reasonably
requested by the Buyers accountants in connection therewith, (ii) the Buyer
shall have the right to have a Representative present for any such access; and
(iii) the Buyer shall not be required to provide access to any information
that is (A) subject to attorney-client or other applicable privilege to the
extent doing so would reasonably be expected to cause such privilege to be
waived, or (B) prohibited by applicable Law. The Seller shall treat all
information obtained from or on behalf of the Buyer as Confidential
Information in accordance with the terms hereof.

 



 

2.4 **_Closing_** **.** The Closing will take place at the offices of Morgan,
Lewis and Bockius LLP, One Federal Street, Boston, MA 02110, or at such other
place as the Buyer and the Seller mutually agree, at 10:00 A.M. local time, on

4.6 **_Compliance with Laws_** **.** Each APT Entity and, to the Knowledge of
the Seller, Minority-Interest Entity is in compliance (a) in all material
respects with the terms, conditions or provisions of its Organizational
Documents, and (b) with all Laws, Permits and Governmental Orders applicable
to it or its assets, properties or business (other than employment and labor
Laws, which are addressed in _Section 4.23_, and Environmental Laws, which
are addressed in _Section 4.17_), except, in the case of clause (b), to the
extent that non-compliance therewith would not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.7 **_Employee Benefit Plans_** _. _No APT Entity or, to the Sellers
Knowledge, Minority-Interest Entity sponsors, maintains, participates in,
contributes to, or has any liability with respect to, any "employee benefit
plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA), or any other plan,
program, policy or arrangement providing retirement, deferred compensation,
incentive compensation, equity-based compensation, health and other welfare,
fringe, severance or other similar benefits, whether formal or informal,
written or oral, which is maintained or contributed to for the benefit of any
director, officer, consultant or employee (whether active or terminated) or
any individual who provides services to any APT Entity or Minority-Interest
Entity, including without limitation any Asset Management Employee
(collectively, the " ** _Company Plans_** "). Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, none of the APT Entities, or to the Sellers Knowledge, any
Minority-Interest Entity is reasonably expected to incur any liability in
respect to "defined benefit pension plan" subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code or "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA. None of the APT Entities or any Minority-Interest Entity has assumed
any liability for any employee benefit plan, program, arrangement or agreement
of Seller or any ERISA Affiliate.

 



 

4.8 **_Capitalization; Subsidiaries; Minority-Interest Entities_** **.**

 



 

(a) The Membership Interests represent all of the issued and outstanding
membership interests of the Target and all of the issued and outstanding
membership interests identified in _Section 4.8(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_ with respect to the APT Entities

 



      
 

 



 

and Minority-Interest Entities. All of the Membership Interests are duly
authorized, validly issued and outstanding and are fully paid and
nonassessable, to the extent such terms are applicable, free of any Liens
(other than Liens arising under applicable securities Laws), and have not been
issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights of any Person. Except

conversion rights, convertible securities, rights of exchange, preemptive
rights, preferential rights or other rights (contractual or otherwise) or

Entities after the Closing Date. The Buyer shall not cause or permit (i) the
amendment of any Tax Return of an APT Entity or, to the extent within the
Buyers control, a Minority-Interest Entity for a Straddle Period or a Taxable

an effective date on or prior to the Closing Date, in each case without the
written consent of the Seller.

shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Buyer shall
consult with the Seller regarding any such Tax proceeding for a

 



      
 

 



 

Straddle Period that the Buyer controls, provide the Seller with information
and documents related thereto, permit the Seller to attend or participate in
any such Tax proceeding, and not settle any such Tax proceeding without the
consent of the Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

proceedings related to the APT Entities and the Minority-Interest Entities.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon any other Partys
request) the provision of records and information which are in the first
Partys possession and reasonably relevant to any such Tax matters and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Parties
shall execute and deliver, or cause the APT Entities to execute and deliver,
such powers of attorney and other documents as may be necessary or appropriate
to give effect to this _Section 6.5_.

 



 

(f) **_Purchase Price Allocation._**

 



 

(i) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the purchase and sale of the
Membership Interests shall be treated, for federal income tax purposes, as the
purchase and sale of the assets, including partnership interests in certain
Subsidiaries and Minority-Interest Entities, of the Target, subject to the
liabilities of the Target and of its Subsidiaries and Minority-Interest
Entities in accordance with Section 752(d) of the Code. The Buyer will send
Seller a schedule with the proposed Purchase Price allocation within thirty
(30) days after Closing, and Seller will have thirty (30) days to object. The
Parties will attempt to work out any disagreements within another thirty (30)
days, but failing agreement, the issues will be submitted for resolution to an
Accountant selected jointly by the Parties.

 



 

(ii) If the Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to Section 2.3, then, within
thirty (30) days after the adjustment, Buyer and Seller will cooperate in good
faith to agree on how the adjustment will be allocated for tax purposes among
each of the assets of the Target, and Purchase Price allocation schedule will
be amended accordingly. In the event that Buyer and Seller do not agree on how
to allocate the adjustment, the adjustment will be allocated among Targets
assets in the same proportion as the amounts originally allocated to such
assets on the Closing Date, and the schedule will be amended accordingly.

 



 

(iii) Buyer and Seller (i) will, and will cause each of their respective
Affiliates to, complete all tax returns, reports, forms, declarations, claims
and other statements in a manner consistent with the purchase price allocation
schedule and (ii) will not, and will cause each of their respective Affiliates
not to, make any inconsistent statement or adjustment on any returns or during
the course of any Internal Revenue Service or other Tax audit. Buyer and
Seller will cooperate with any reasonable request by the other Party to aid in
the filing of Tax Returns, reports or other similar matters or handling of
inquiries from Tax authorities.

pursuant to _Section 2.5(d)_ and _Section 2.6(c)_ shall survive the Closing

9.2 **_Indemnification._**

 



 

(a) _Indemnification of the Seller_. After the Closing, the Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller (and its directors, managers, officers,
employees, agents, Affiliates, successors, and assigns) from and against any
and all Losses based upon, arising out of or incurred with respect to (i) the
breach of any of the Buyers representations and warranties contained in
_Article V_ or failure of any certificate delivered at the Closing to be true
and correct

 



      
 

 



 

in all respects as of the Closing Date, or (ii) any breach or nonperformance
of any covenant or obligation to be performed by the Buyer hereunder or under
any agreement executed in connection herewith.

 



 

(b) _Indemnification of the Buyer_. After the Closing, the Seller shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer (and its respective directors, officers,
employees, agents, Affiliates, successors, and assigns including the Target)
(the " ** _Buyer Indemnitees_** ") from and against any and all Losses based
upon, arising out of or incurred with respect to:

 



 

(i) the breach of the Sellers representations and warranties in _Article
III_ or _Article IV_ of this Agreement or failure of any certificate
delivered by the Seller at the Closing to be true and correct in all respects
as of the Closing Date, and

 



 

(ii) any breach or nonperformance of any covenant or obligation to be
performed by the Seller hereunder or under any agreement executed in
connection herewith.

 



 

(c) _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_. The rights of the Buyer
Indemnitees to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of _Section 9.2(b)_
are subject to the following limitations:

 



 

(i) the amount of any Loss subject to indemnification by the Seller hereunder
or of any Claim therefor shall be reduced by any and all amounts actually
recovered by the Buyer Indemnitee from the following collateral sources
(collectively, the " ** _Collateral Sources_** "): (i) any insurance proceeds
actually received by the Buyer Indemnitees on account of such Loss, net of
expenses paid to third parties in procuring any such recovery, and (ii) any
Tax benefit actually realized by the Buyer Indemnitees as a result of the
event or circumstances giving rise to such Loss. In the event that the Buyer
Indemnitees obtain any recovery from one or more Collateral Sources or any
other Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses, subsequent to an
indemnification payment made hereunder, then such Buyer Indemnitee shall
promptly reimburse the Seller for any payment made or expense incurred by
Seller in connection with providing such indemnification up to the amount
received by the Buyer Indemnitee, (net of direct collection expenses and
Taxes), or, if a Loss has not yet been determined or paid by the Seller, the
Sellers indemnification obligations in respect of such Loss shall be reduced
by the aggregate amount of the recovery from any Collateral Sources or any
other Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses (net of direct
collection expenses and Taxes);

 



 

(ii) the Buyer Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant to
_Section 9.2(b)(i)_ unless and until the aggregate Losses incurred by the
Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)(i)_ exceed one and one-half
percent (1.5%) of the Purchase Price in the aggregate (the " ** _Deductible_**
") (after which the RandW Insurance Policy, or the Seller, as applicable, will
be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees, subject to the limitations
set forth herein, from and against all Losses in excess of the Deductible);

 



 

(iii) the Buyer Indemnitees shall be responsible for any and all Losses up to
the amount of the Retention (as such term is defined in the RandW Insurance
Policy) under the RandW Insurance Policy. The sole source of funds to recover
for any Losses arising from a breach of the Sellers representations in
_Section 4.14(d)_ shall be the RandW Insurance Policy.

 



      
 

 



 

Recourse for Losses that were specifically excluded from coverage under the
RandW Insurance Policy as set forth in Section 4 of the RandW Insurance Policy on
the day coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy became effective (the " **
_Excluded Matters_** ") shall be to the Seller Parent Guaranty. With respect
to Other RandW Insured Losses (as defined below), Buyer shall notify Seller if
it intends to seek recourse under the Seller Parent Guaranty before initiating
a claim under the RandW Insurance Policy. If the Buyer elects not to seek
recourse to the Seller Parent Guaranty then the Buyers sole recourse for
Other RandW Insured Losses shall be the RandW Insurance Policy. If, and only if,
Buyer notifies Seller that it intends to seek recourse to the Seller Parent
Guaranty, shall the procedures provided by _Sections 9.2(c)(iv)_ and _(v)_
apply;

 



 

(iv) Upon the Insurer (as such term is defined in the RandW Insurance Policy)
acknowledging that the Retention has been fully satisfied, the RandW Insurance
Policy shall be the initial source of funds to recover for any other Losses
for which the Buyer Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification in respect of
_Section 9.2(b)_ (the " ** _Other R andW Insured Losses_**"). With respect to
the Other RandW Insured Losses, in the event that (A) the remaining available
Limit of Liability (as such term is defined in the RandW Insurance Policy) under
the RandW Insurance Policy is insufficient to fully indemnify the Buyer
Indemnitees for such Other RandW Insured Losses as a consequence of such Limit
of Liability being wholly or partially exhausted (the " ** _Excess Other R andW
Insured Losses_**"), the Buyer shall, subject to the other terms, conditions
and limitations set forth herein, have recourse to the Seller Parent Guaranty
for such Excess Other RandW Insured Losses; and/or (B) the first dispositive
order or determination of a court with jurisdiction over the matter determines
that the Insurer is not obligated to pay the full amount of such Losses
claimed in good faith by the Buyer Indemnitees (the " ** _Disputed Other R andW
Insured Losses_**"), the Buyer shall, subject to the other terms, conditions
and limitations set forth herein, have recourse to the Seller Parent Guaranty
for such Disputed Other RandW Insured Losses, subject to and only in the event
that the Buyer Indemnitees fully comply with the conditions set forth in
_Section 9.2(d)(v)_;

 



 

(v) With respect to any Claim for indemnification for which Buyer notified
Seller of its intent to seek recourse against the Seller Parent Guaranty, the
Buyer Indemnitees shall have no right to recover under the Seller Parent
Guaranty unless:

 



 

(A) the Buyer Indemnitees seek and obtain the Sellers consent and approval of
the form of such Claim Notice seeking coverage for any Other RandW Insured
Losses prior to submitting such Claim Notice under the RandW Insurance Policy;

 



 

(B) the Buyer Indemnitees seek and obtain the Sellers consent and approval of
any coverage counsel retained by the Buyer Indemnitees to prosecute such claim
for coverage for any Other RandW Insured Losses (" ** _Retained Counsel_** ");

 



 

(C) the Buyer Indemnitees seek and obtain the Sellers consent and prior
approval with respect any and all material correspondence to the Insurer from
the Buyer Indemnitees regarding the Buyer Indemnitees claims for coverage for
such Other RandW Insured Losses;

 



 

(D) the Buyer Indemnitees seek and obtain the Sellers consent and approval
prior to the commencement of any litigation or other dispute resolution
procedure

 



      
 

 



 

against the Insurer in connection with such Other Insured RandW Losses,
including as to the forum and venue of such litigation dispute resolution
procedure;

 



 

(E) the Seller is provided draft copies of all pleadings, briefs, discovery
requests, other court papers or correspondence which relate or pertain to the
Buyer Indemnitees claims for coverage for the Other RandW Insured Losses;

 



 

(F) the Buyer Indemnitees seek and obtain the Sellers consent and prior
approval with respect to all material positions in such pleadings, briefs,
discovery requests, other court papers or correspondence regarding the Buyer
Indemnitees claims for coverage for such Other RandW Insured Losses;

 



 

(G) at the Sellers request, Retained Counsel resists the production of all
documents or things or the providing of any information which the Seller
asserts would not properly be discoverable, and uses its best efforts to
ensure that the Sellers documents and witnesses need only be produced in
compliance with the subpoena power or governing rules of court or arbitration
wherein such action is pending, and shall produce documents and other
information in compliance with such rules and/or the orders such court or
arbitration panel may issue pertaining thereto; and

 



 

(H) the Buyer Indemnitees seek and obtain the consent and approval of the
Seller in pursuing or entering into any settlement with respect to any Other
RandW Insured Losses, and to the extent such settlement results in payment by
the Insurer of an amount less than the full amount of such Other RandW Insured
Losses claimed by the Buyer Indemnitees in good faith, the Buyer Indemnitees
expressly waive any right to seek recovery from the Seller Parent Guaranty for
such deficiency.

 



 

In implementing subsections (A) through (H) above: (1) the Seller shall be
solely responsible for the costs and expenses of its actions, (2) the Seller
shall take no actions, or fail to take any action, that prejudices the claim
of the Buyer; and (3) the Seller shall not have the right to determine whether
to file a claim for coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy; _provided_ that
the Buyer agrees that the Seller shall be entitled to associate in the
prosecution, negotiation and settlement of a claim for coverage filed by the
Buyer Indemnitees for Other RandW Insured Losses under the RandW Insurance
Policy;

 



 

(vi) except with respect to Losses related to breaches of the Fundamental
Representations of the Seller, the aggregate indemnification obligation of the
Seller pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)(i)_ shall in no event exceed fifteen
percent (15%) of the Purchase Price (it being understood that, except with
respect to Losses related to breaches of the Fundamental Representations of
the Seller, any amounts received by the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to the RandW
Insurance Policy shall be allocated in satisfaction of such capped limit of
liability);

 



 

(vii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (x) the
cumulative indemnification obligations of the Seller under this Agreement for
a breach of Sellers representation in _Section 4.13(d)_, shall be no greater
than the Buyers portion of the "Maximum Recapture Equity Contribution
Commitment" as defined in the Recapture Guaranty Replacement Documentation;
and (y) the cumulative indemnification obligations of the Seller

 



      
 

 



 

under this Agreement shall in no event exceed the Purchase Price (as adjusted
pursuant to _Section 2.3_); _provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt,
Seller shall have no liability under this Agreement for a breach of its
representation in _Section 4.13(d)_, to the extent of any payment made by
Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates under the Recapture Guaranty Replacement
Documentation; and

 



 

(viii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (x) the
cumulative indemnification obligations of the Buyer under this Agreement for a
breach of Buyers representation in _Section 5.9_, shall be no greater than
the Sellers portion of the "Maximum Recapture Equity Contribution Commitment"
as defined in the Recapture ECA AP Guarantees and the Recapture ECA Veolia
Guarantees; and (y) the cumulative indemnification obligations of the Buyer
under this Agreement with respect to all other matters shall in no event
exceed the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.3_); _provided_
that for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall have no liability under this
Agreement for a breach of its representation in _Section 5.9_, to the extent
of any payment made by Buyer or any of Buyers Affiliates under the Recapture
Guaranty Replacement Documentation.

 



 

(d) _Additional Indemnity Provisions_. The indemnification obligations of the
Buyer and the Seller hereunder shall be subject to the following terms and
conditions:

 



 

(i) From and after the Closing, the sole recourse and exclusive remedy of the
Buyer and the Seller against each other arising out of this Agreement or any
certificate delivered in connection with this Agreement, or otherwise arising
from the Buyers acquisition of the Membership Interests, shall be to assert a
Claim for indemnification under the indemnification provisions of this
_Article IX_.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding _Section 9.2(d)(i)_, nothing in this Agreement shall
operate to (i) relieve a Party of any liability for willful misconduct or (ii)
limit the rights of the Parties with respect to intentional or willful
misrepresentation of material facts regarding the representations and
warranties made in _Article III_, _Article IV_ or _Article V_, as
applicable, of this Agreement (in each case, as qualified by the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, as applicable) or in any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto which constitute common law fraud under
applicable Laws.

 



 

(iii) For the purposes of determining whether there has been a breach or an
inaccuracy in respect of any representation or warranty for the purpose of
indemnification under this _Section 9.2_, all Claims for Losses arising out
of the same facts, events or circumstances resulting in such inaccuracy or
breach shall be treated as a single Claim.

 



 

(iv) To the extent that an Indemnifying Party has discharged any Claim for
indemnification hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to all
rights of the Indemnified Party against any Person to the extent of the Losses
that relate to such Claim. Any Indemnified Party shall, upon written request
by the Indemnifying Party following the discharge of such Claim, execute an
instrument reasonably necessary to evidence such subrogation rights.

 



 

(v) In the event that any Party to this Agreement proposes to make any Claim
for indemnification pursuant to this _Section 9.2_, or would have the right
to make a Claim

 



      
 

 



 

for indemnification but for the minimum or maximum limitations on
indemnification contained in _Section 9.2(b)_, the Party making the Claim (or
with such right) (the " ** _Indemnified Party_** ") shall promptly deliver on
or prior to the date upon which the applicable representations and warranties
or covenants expire pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and within a
reasonable time of discovery of the breach of or nonperformance of any
covenant or obligation to be performed under this Agreement, a certificate
signed by the party making the Claim or an officer of the party making the
Claim (the " ** _Claim Certificate_** ") to the Seller or the Buyer, whichever
is applicable (such party from whom indemnification is sought the " **
_Indemnifying Party_** "), which Claim Certificate shall (A) state the
occurrence giving rise to the Claim; (B) specify the section of this Agreement
under which such Claim is made; and (C) specify in reasonable detail each
individual item of Loss or other Claim, including the section of this
Agreement under which such Claim is made, the amount thereof if reasonably
ascertainable, the date such Loss or liability was incurred, properly accrued
or is anticipated, the basis for any anticipated Loss or liability and the
nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or the Claim to which such
Loss or liability is related. The Indemnified Party making the Claim shall
state only what is required in subsections (A)-(C) above and shall not admit
or deny the validity of the facts or circumstances out of which such Claim
arose.

 



 

(vi) Any indemnity payment made under this Agreement following the Closing
shall be treated by the Parties hereto as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
for the Membership Interests for Tax purposes, and the Parties agree to report
such payments consistent therewith to the extent permitted under applicable
Law.

 



 

(vii) The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)_ and _Section 9.2(b)_ shall survive the Closing for the periods set
forth in _Section 9.1_, except for Claims for indemnification pursuant to
such sections asserted prior to the end of such periods, which Claims shall
survive with the final resolution thereof.

 



 

(viii) Each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
its Losses (including by using such efforts to recover any insurance as may be
available with respect to such Loss) upon and after becoming aware of any
event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not be deemed to impose any
obligation or duty to initiate legal proceedings to seek such recovery.

 



 

(ix) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT, NO
PARTY HERETO SHALL, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO ANY OTHER
PARTY FOR ANY INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SPECIAL DAMAGES, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES,
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES CONSISTING OF BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION, DIMINUTION IN VALUE, LOST PROFITS OR LOST ASSETS, OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES, EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE
INCLUDED AS PART OF SUCH CLAIM.

 



 

(e) _Defense of Third Party Claims and Extension of Statute of Limitations._

 



 

(i) With respect to the Excluded Matters and/or any Other RandW Insured Losses,
the Indemnified Party shall promptly give written notice (which such written

 



      
 

 



 

notice shall state in reasonable detail the nature of any such claim for
indemnification and the provisions of this Agreement upon which such claim for
indemnification is made) hereunder to the Indemnifying Party after obtaining
notice of any claim as to which recovery may be sought against the
Indemnifying Party because of the indemnity in this _Article IX_, and, if
such indemnity obligation shall arise from the claim of a third party, shall
permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of any such claim and any
litigation resulting from such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume control of the defense
of any claim (i) to the extent that the object of such claim for
indemnification is to obtain an injunction, restraining order, declaratory
relief or other non-monetary relief against the Indemnified Party which, if
successful, would materially adversely affect the business, operations,
assets, or financial condition of the Indemnified Party (ii) if the named
parties to any such action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties)
include both the Indemnified Parties and the Indemnifying Parties and the
former shall have been advised in writing by counsel (with a copy to the
Indemnifying Parties) that there are one or more legal or equitable defenses
available to them that are different from or additional to those available to
Indemnifying Parties (in which event each shall have the right to utilize
counsel of their own choosing), or (iii) if such action or proceeding
involves, or could reasonably be expected to involve liability that would
constitute a material adverse effect on the Indemnified Parties. Failure by
the Indemnifying Party to notify an Indemnified Party of its election to
defend any such claim or action by a third party within thirty (30) days after
notice thereof shall have been given to the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed
a waiver by the Indemnifying Party of its right to defend such claim and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonably incurred out-of-pocket cost and
expense of the Indemnified Party to defend such claim. The Indemnified Party
shall (unless the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense thereof) keep the
Indemnifying Party reasonably apprised of any significant developments
relating to any such claim.

 



 

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of any such claim by a
third party or litigation resulting therefrom after receipt of notice from
such Indemnified Party, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall not, in the defense
of such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, consent to entry of any
judgment (other than a judgment of dismissal on the merits without costs) or
agree to any settlement thereof except with the written consent of the
Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) and (ii) anything in this _Section 9.2(e)_ to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Indemnified Party may, with counsel of its choice and at
its expense, participate in the defense of any such claim or litigation.

 



 

(iii) If the Indemnifying Party shall not assume the defense of any such claim
by a third party or litigation resulting therefrom after receipt of notice
from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may defend against such
claim or litigation in such manner as it deems appropriate; provided that the
Indemnified Party may not settle such claim or litigation without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



     

 



 

 **ARTICLE X. 
TERMINATION**

 



 

10.1 **_Termination_** **. **This Agreement may be terminated, and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned, as follows:

 



 

(a) by written consent of the Buyer and the Seller;

 



 

(b) by written notice of the Seller or the Buyer, if the Closing shall not
have been consummated on or before the date that is ninety (90) days after the
date of this Agreement (the " ** _Outside Date_** "), unless extended in
writing by the Buyer and the Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this paragraph shall not be available to any
Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been
the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior
to such date; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Closing has not occurred on
or before the date that is seventy-five (75) days after the date of this
Agreement due to the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in _Sections
7.4_ and _8.4_ (and all other conditions to the Closing (other than those
conditions which by their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing) have
been satisfied (or waived) or are capable of being satisfied by the Outside
Date), then the Buyer or the Seller, by written notice to the other party,
shall have the right to extend the Outside Date to a date that is on or before
the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of this
Agreement;

 



 

(c) by written notice of the Seller, if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant made by the Buyer in this Agreement, such
that the conditions in _Article VIII_ are not capable of being satisfied and
which have not been cured by the Buyer within twenty (20) Business Days after
receipt of written notice from the Seller requesting such breach to be cured;
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 10.1(c)_ shall not be available to the Seller if the failure of the
Seller to fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement has been the
primary cause of, or resulted in, such breach;

 



 

(d) by written notice of the Buyer (i) if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant made by the Seller in this Agreement,
such that the conditions in _Article VII_ are not capable of being satisfied
and which have not been cured by the Seller within twenty (20) Business Days
after receipt of written notice from the Buyer requesting such breach to be
cured; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 10.1(d)_ shall not be available to the Buyer if the failure of the
Buyer to fulfill any of their obligations under this Agreement has been the
primary cause of, or resulted in, such breach, or (ii) if any event,
development or occurrence which is the subject of the Disclosure Schedule
Update delivered pursuant to _Section 11.17(b)_ constitutes something that
has had or would reasonably be expected to result in a Project Material
Adverse Effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Buyer does not elect to
terminate this Agreement within fifteen (15) Business Days of its receipt of
such Disclosure Schedule Update, then the Buyer shall be deemed to have
irrevocably waived any right to terminate this Agreement with respect to such
matter; or

 



 

(e) by written notice of either the Seller or the Buyer, if any Governmental
Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other
action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such
order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this _Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _10.1(e)_ in respect of such order, decree, ruling or action shall not be
available to the Party that has directly or indirectly solicited or encouraged
the adoption thereof.

 



 

This Agreement shall automatically terminate without any further action upon
the Sellers receipt of a termination notice from the Buyer pursuant to this
_Section 10.1_.

 



 

10.2 **_Effect of Termination_** **. **If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 10.1_, all rights and obligations of the Parties
hereunder shall terminate and no Party shall have any liability to the other
Parties, except for the rights and obligations of the Parties in this _Section
10.2_ and in _Sections 6.12_ ( _Confidentiality_ ), _11.1_ ( _Notices_ ),
_11.3_ ( _Expenses_ ), _11.4_ ( _Press Releases and Public Announcements_ ),
_11.11_ ( _Governing Law_ ), _11.12_ ( _Arbitration_ ), _11.13_ (
_Jurisdiction_ ), and _11.14_ ( _Specific Performance_ ), which shall survive
the termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_
shall not release any Party from any liability for any breach by such Party of
the terms and provisions of this Agreement prior to such termination.

(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such release or announcement is required by Law or by any

as set forth in _Sections 9.2(a)_ and _9.2(b)_.

 



 

11.8 **_No Assignment; Binding Effect_** **. **Neither this Agreement nor any
right, interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned by any Party without
the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempt to do so will
be void, except for assignments and transfers by operation of Law. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit
of and is enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

inserted for convenience of reference only and do not define or limit the

illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
(c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and
effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision or by its severance herefrom, and (d) in lieu of such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a
part of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.

 



 

11.11 **_Governing Law_** **. **This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York, without regard

11.12 **_Arbitration._**

 



 

(a) Except for requests for orders in aid of arbitration or enforcement of the
award of an arbitrator or as set forth in _Section 2.3_, all disputes arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement, the breach, termination,
enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the legal relations between
the parties (" ** _Dispute_** "), including but not limited to disputes about
arbitrability or the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal, shall be resolved
by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association
(the " ** _AAA_** ") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, then
in effect, which shall be the sole and exclusive method of resolving any such
Dispute. The arbitration shall be conducted and the award shall be rendered in
New York City, New York, or such other place as the parties to the arbitration
agree before a panel of arbitrators comprised of one arbitrator selected by
the Seller and one arbitrator selected by the Buyer in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules who shall jointly select a third arbitrator who
shall chair the tribunal. Each arbitrator shall be a retired judge or a
practicing attorney with no less than 15 years of experience as such and shall
be experienced in arbitration and with disputes relating to the subject matter
to be arbitrated. For the avoidance of doubt, the arbitral tribunal shall
maintain all proceedings in confidence, shall resolve all disputes in
accordance with the Laws of the State of New York and shall not assume the
powers of an amiable compositeur or decide ex aequo et bono. Except in
accordance with any express exception contained in this Agreement, each party
hereby irrevocably waives and foregoes any right to recover punitive,
exemplary or special damages with respect to any Dispute as set forth in
_Section 9.2(d)(ix)_, and the Parties hereby agree that the arbitrators are
not empowered to award damages except in accordance with the express
limitations contained in this Agreement (including _Section 9.2(d)(ix)_). The
award of such arbitrators shall be a reasoned award.

 



 

(b) All of the expenses that arise from the arbitral proceeding, as well as
the fees of the arbitrators, shall be paid by the losing Party, if any, as
determined by the arbitrators. Said losing Party shall reimburse the
prevailing Party the amounts deposited by the prevailing Party at the
commencement of the arbitration or thereafter as required by the AAA. The
Parties shall each bear the costs and fees of their respective counsel,
irrespective of the outcome of the arbitration.

 



 

(c) The arbitral award shall be final and binding on the Parties and judgment
upon any award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction over any
of the Parties or any of their assets. All notices relating to any arbitration
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be effective if given in accordance
with the provisions of _Section 11.1_. The arbitration provisions set forth
herein and any award rendered hereunder shall be governed by the Federal
Arbitration Act, Title 9, United States Code.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) By agreeing to arbitration, the Parties do not intend to deprive any
court, as provided for in _Section 11.13_, of its jurisdiction to issue a
pre-arbitral injunction, pre-arbitral attachment, or other order in aid of
arbitration proceedings and the enforcement of any award and judgment thereon.
Without prejudice to such provisional remedies as may be available under the
jurisdiction of a court, the arbitral tribunal shall have full authority to
grant provisional remedies or modify or vacate any temporary or preliminary
relief issued by a court, and to award damages for the failure of any Party to
respect the arbitral tribunals orders to that effect.

 



 

11.13 **_JURISDICTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_** **.**
SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION REQUIREMENTS OF _SECTION 11.12_ AND EXCEPT AS SET
FORTH IN _SECTION 2.3_, ALL ACTIONS PERMITTED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR UNDER
ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY ACTION TO
COMPEL ARBITRATION IN AID OF ARBITRATION OR FOR PROVISIONAL RELIEF IN AID OF
ARBITRATION) SHALL BE BROUGHT EXCLUSIVELY IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT
LOCATED WITHIN THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO CONSENTS AND AGREES TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS
FOR SUCH PURPOSE, AND WAIVES ANY OBJECTION AS TO THE VENUE OF SUCH COURTS FOR
PURPOSES OF SUCH ACTION OR ANY CLAIM OF INCONVENIENT FORUM. EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO FURTHER CONSENTS AND AGREES THAT ANY ACTION TO ENFORCE A FINAL
ARBITRAL AWARD OR JUDGMENT THEREON MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT
JURISDICTION. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO FURTHER IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE
SERVICE OF PROCESS OUT OF ANY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED COURTS IN ANY SUCH ACTION
OR PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING OF COPIES THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED
MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO SUCH PARTY AT THE ADDRESS SPECIFIED IN THIS
AGREEMENT, SUCH SERVICE TO BECOME EFFECTIVE 15 DAYS AFTER SUCH MAILING.
NOTHING HEREIN SHALL IN ANY WAY BE DEEMED TO LIMIT THE ABILITY OF ANY PARTY
HERETO TO SERVE ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS IN ANY
OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO

its right to seek any other form of relief that may be

right to seek) specific performance under this Agreement before exercising any

and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if

or would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (b)
the Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or

information has or would reasonably be expected to result in a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect. The Seller Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer Disclosure

(but not the obligation) to supplement or amend the Seller Disclosure Schedule

indemnification under _Section 9.2_ (subject to the terms and conditions
therein) shall not be waived or modified with respect to such matter. If any
event, development or occurrence which is the subject of a Disclosure Schedule
Update constitutes something that has had or would reasonably be expected to
result in a Project Material Adverse Effect, then the Buyer shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.1(d)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Buyer has the right to, but does not
elect to terminate this Agreement within fifteen (15) Business Days after its
receipt of such Disclosure Schedule Update, then the Buyer shall be deemed to
have irrevocably waived any right to terminate this Agreement with respect to
such matter under any of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ and,
further, shall have irrevocably waived its right to indemnification under
_Section 9.2_ with respect to such matter.
