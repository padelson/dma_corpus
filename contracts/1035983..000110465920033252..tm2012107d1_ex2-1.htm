representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein,
and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the parties hereby
agree as follows:

 THE MERGER

  



  

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company,
whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent. The Company as the surviving corporation of the Merger
is sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_."

  



  

1.2 _Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause
the Merger to become effective by filing a certificate of merger in customary
form (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL as
soon as practicable after the Closing (but in any event on the Closing Date
if the Closing occurs at a time at which such filings are accepted for filing
by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or the first business day
thereafter if the Closing occurs at a time at which such filings are not
accepted for filing by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware). The
actual time of acceptance of such filing by the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (or any later time as may be mutually agreed upon in
writing by Parent and the Company and expressly designated as the effective
time of the Merger in the Certificate of Merger) is referred to herein as the
" _Effective Time_."

  



  

1.3 _Closing_.  The Merger shall be consummated at a closing (the

offices of Parent, 675 Bering Drive, Suite 400, Houston, Texas 77057 or
remotely via electronic exchange of documents and signatures, as promptly as
practicable following, but in no event later than, the second (2nd)
Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions
set forth in _Article 5_ hereof (other than, but subject to satisfaction of,
the conditions to be satisfied on the Closing Date), or on such other date and
at such other time and place as may be agreed to by the parties in writing.
Such time and date are referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_
". Subject to the provisions of _Article 7_ of this Agreement, the failure to
consummate the Merger on the date and time and at the place determined
pursuant to this _Section 1.3_ shall not result in the termination of this
Agreement and shall not relieve any party to this Agreement of any obligation
under this Agreement.

of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become,
and shall thereupon represent, one fully paid and nonassessable share of

privileges as each share so converted, and shall thereupon constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Company Capital Stock; Company Treasury Stock; Dissenting
Shares_.

  



  

(i) _Company Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of

conditions set forth in this _Section 1.7_ and throughout this Agreement,
(A) each outstanding share of Series AA Preferred Stock (other than Company

amount of cash (without interest) equal to the Per Share Closing Participation

(B) above subject to reduction for applicable Tax withholding, upon the
surrender of the applicable Certificate (or alternatively, a Lost Instrument
Affidavit and a Lost Instrument Indemnity Agreement), in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and in the manner provided herein. From and after the
Effective Time, each share of Company Capital Stock that is canceled and
converted into the right to receive that portion of the Merger
Consideration by virtue of the Merger pursuant to this _Section 1.7(b)(i)_
shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate formerly
representing each such share of Company Capital Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, that portion of
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of each share of Company Capital
Stock evidenced by such certificate pursuant to this _Section 1.7(b)(i)_
(subject to reduction for applicable Tax withholding), upon the surrender of
the applicable Certificate (or alternatively, a Lost Instrument Affidavit and
a Lost Instrument Indemnity Agreement) in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and in the manner provided herein. For purposes of calculating the
amount of cash payable to each Company Stockholder in respect of such Company
Stockholder's shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to this _Section
1.7(b)(i)_, (A) all of the shares of Company Capital Stock held by such
Company Stockholder shall be aggregated on a certificate-by-certificate
basis, if applicable, and (B) the amount of cash payable in respect of each
such certificate shall be rounded down to the nearest cent.

  



  

   

\- 4 -

 



    



  

(ii) _Company Treasury Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, each share of Company Capital Stock that is outstanding and owned by
the Company as treasury stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(" _Company Treasury Stock_ ") shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
canceled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall
thereupon cease to exist.

  



  

(iii) _Dissenting Shares_.

  



  

(A) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time eligible under Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") to
exercise appraisal rights and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of
the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who is entitled to demand, and
properly demands, appraisal of such shares pursuant to Section 262, and
complies in all respects with the provisions of Section 262 and has not
effectively withdrawn or lost the right to demand relief as a dissenting
stockholder under the DGCL as of the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive any portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
1.7(b)(i)_, and the holder or holders of such shares shall be entitled only
to such rights as may be granted to such holder or holders under Section 262\.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 1.7(b)(iii)(A)_, if any
holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal under Section 262, or
a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder's shares shall
automatically be canceled and converted into and represent only the right to
receive that portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such
shares pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)(i)_, without interest, upon surrender of
the certificate representing such shares.

  



  

(B) The Company shall (1) comply with the requirements of Section
262, (2) give Parent prompt notice of any written demand received by the
Company pursuant to Section 262 and of withdrawal of any such demand, and
provide copies of any documents or instruments served with respect thereto
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company, and (3) give Parent the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demands. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer
prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand unless Parent
shall have consented in writing to such payment or settlement offer.

  



  

(C) Any amount paid by the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent to any Person with respect to Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section
262 in excess of the amount payable pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)(i)_ for each
such Dissenting Share, and all interest, costs, expenses and fees as incurred
by the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent in connection with the
exercise of all rights under Section 262, shall constitute Losses for
purposes of this Agreement, and the Surviving Corporation and Parent, as the
case may be, shall, without limiting any other rights, be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 6.2_ and to recover such Losses,
without limitation.

  



  

   

\- 5 -

 



    



  

(c) _Company Options and Company Warrants_. No Company Options
(whether vested or unvested) and no Company Warrants (whether or not
exercisable or vested) shall be assumed by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation and all issued and outstanding Company Options and
Company Warrants shall be terminated or canceled prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) _Merger Consideration as Maximum Payment Amount_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the aggregate
amounts payable by Parent hereunder with respect to all outstanding Company
Capital Stock shall not exceed the Merger Consideration.

  



  

1.8 _Merger Consideration Adjustment (Transaction Expenses and
Indebtedness)_.

  



  

(a) _Pre-Closing Adjustment Statement_. At least two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent
a statement (the " _Estimated Adjustment Statemen_ t") setting forth the
Company's good faith estimates of (i) the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of
the Company and its Subsidiaries outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Closing (the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ ") and (ii) the aggregate
amount of all Transaction Expenses accrued but unpaid as of immediately prior
to the Closing (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ ").

  



  

(b) _Final Adjustment Statement_. As soon as practicable but in
no event later than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, the
Stockholder Representative shall deliver to Parent a statement (the "
_Company 's Adjustment Statement_") setting forth the Stockholder
Representative's good faith calculations of (i) the aggregate amount of
Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Final Closing Indebtedness_ ") and
(ii) the aggregate amount of all Transaction Expenses accrued but unpaid as of
immediately prior to the Closing (the  " _Final Transaction Expenses_ ").

  



  

(c) Following receipt of Company's Adjustment Statement, Parent
shall either accept Company's Adjustment Statement, which statement shall
then be deemed the final statement (" _Final Adjustment Statement_ ") or
certify to the Stockholder Representative its alternate calculation of the
Final Closing Indebtedness and/or the Final Transaction Expenses, as
applicable (" _Parent 's Adjustment Statement_"). If Parent fails to accept
the Company's Adjustment Statement or deliver to the
Stockholder Representative Parent's Adjustment Statement within thirty (30)
days of receipt of the Company's Adjustment Statement, the Company's
Adjustment Statement shall be final and binding on the parties. If Parent
timely delivers Parent's Adjustment Statement, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall then make good faith efforts to meet and resolve the
differences between the Company's Adjustment Statement and Parent's
Adjustment Statement. If within thirty (30) days after receipt by the
Stockholder Representative of Parent's Adjustment Statement, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative have been unable to reach agreement, either Parent
or the Stockholder Representative may engage the Accounting Firm to determine
which calculation of the Final Closing Indebtedness and/or the Final
Transaction Expenses, as applicable, is more accurate, the
Company's Adjustment Statement or Parent's Adjustment Statement, and shall
certify the Accounting Firm's choice as the Final Adjustment Statement. The
Accounting Firm shall certify this decision in writing to Parent and the
Stockholder Representative; the Accounting Firm shall have no other choice
but to select either the Company's Adjustment Statement in its entirety
or Parent's Adjustment Statement in its entirety. The Accounting Firm's
determination shall be final and binding on the parties. The fees, costs, and
expenses of the Accounting Firm, including any attorneys' fees related
thereto, shall be borne by (i) the Company Stockholders if Parent's
Adjustment Statement is selected by the Accounting Firm as more accurate; 
_provided, however_ , that in lieu of receiving payment from the Company
Stockholders, Parent may in its sole discretion elect to offset an amount
equal to such amount from the amount owed by Parent pursuant to the Note, or
(ii) Parent if the Company's Adjustment Statement is selected by the
Accounting Firm as more accurate.

(d) Once the Final Adjustment Statement has been determined
pursuant to _Section 1.8(c)_, the following shall occur: (i) if the Final
Adjustment Statement reflects that the sum of the Final Indebtedness plus the
Final Transaction Expenses is greater than the sum of the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness plus the Estimated Transaction Expenses set forth in the
Estimated Adjustment Statement, then the Company Stockholders shall pay (or
cause to be paid) to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available
funds the amount equal to the surplus within ten (10) Business Days;
_provided, however_ , that in lieu of receiving payment from the Company
Stockholders, Parent may in its sole discretion elect to offset an amount
equal to such amount from the amount owed by Parent pursuant to the Note; and
(ii) if the Final Adjustment Statement reflects that the sum of the
Final Indebtedness plus the Final Transaction Expenses is less than the sum
of the Estimated Closing Indebtedness plus the Estimated Transaction Expenses
set forth in the Estimated Adjustment Statement, then Parent shall pay to the
Company Stockholders, an amount equal to such shortfall by wire transfer in
immediately available funds within ten (10) Business Days.

  



  

1.9 _Merger Consideration Adjustment (Working Capital
Adjustment)_. Following the Closing, and after seventy-five (75) days,
the Stockholder Representative shall undertake and prepare a look-back
analysis that, in accordance with GAAP, shall determine what the Company's
Working Capital was on the Closing Date. The Stockholder Representative and
Parent agree that the Working Capital shall be calculated as set forth on
_Section 1.9 of the Disclosure Schedule_ hereto. Pursuant to this _Section
1.9_, the Stockholder Representative shall provide Parent with its proposed
calculation of the Company's Working Capital as of Closing, and reasonable
supporting information relating to its determination of the Working Capital
all as set forth in writing by the Stockholder Representative and delivered
in accordance with the provisions of _Section 8.2_ (the " _Company 's WC
Statement_").

  



  

(a) Following receipt of Company's WC Statement, Parent shall
either accept Company's WC Statement, which statement shall then be deemed
the final statement (" _Final WC Statement_ "), or provide to the Stockholder
Representative its alternate calculation of working capital (" _Parent 's WC
Statement_"). If Parent fails to accept the Company's WC Statement or deliver
to the Stockholder Representative Parent's WC Statement within thirty (30)
days of receipt of the Company's WC Statement, the Company's WC Statement
shall be final and binding on the parties. If Parent timely delivers Parent's
WC Statement, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall then make good
faith efforts to meet and resolve the differences between the Company's WC
Statement and Parent's WC Statement. If within thirty (30) days after
receipt by the Stockholder Representative of Parent's WC Statement, Parent
and the Stockholder Representative have been unable to reach agreement,
either Parent or the Stockholder Representative may engage the Accounting Firm
to determine which calculation of Working Capital is more accurate, the
Company's WC Statement or Parent's WC Statement, and shall certify the
Accounting Firm's choice as the Final WC Statement. The Accounting Firm shall
certify this decision in writing to Parent and the
Stockholder Representative; the Accounting Firm shall have no other choice
but to select either the Company's WC Statement in its entirety or Parent's
WC Statement in its entirety. The Accounting Firm's determination shall be
final and binding on the parties. The fees, costs, and expenses of the
Accounting Firm, including any attorneys' fees related thereto, shall be borne
by (i) the Company Stockholders if the Parent's WC Statement is selected by
the Accounting Firm as more accurate; _provided, however_ , that in lieu of
receiving payment from the Company Stockholders, Parent may in its sole
discretion elect to offset an amount equal to such amount from the amount
owed by Parent pursuant to the Note, or (ii) Parent if the Company's WC
Statement is selected by the Accounting Firm as more accurate.

  



  

   

\- 7 -

 



    



  

(b) Once the Final WC Statement has been determined pursuant to
_Section 1.9(a)_, the following shall occur: (i) if the Final WC Statement
reflects Working Capital greater than the Required Working Capital, then
Parent shall pay the Company Stockholders, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds within ten (10) Business Days following determination of
the Final WC Statement, an amount equal to such surplus less the aggregate
amount of any additional Change in Control Payments triggered as a result of
the payment of such surplus; and (ii) if the Final WC Statement reflects
Working Capital less than the Required Working Capital, then the Company
Stockholders shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent within ten (10)
Business Days following determination of the Final WC Statement, an amount
equal to such shortfall by wire transfer in immediately available funds;
_provided, however_ , that in lieu of receiving payment from the Company
Stockholders, Parent may in its sole discretion elect to offset an amount
equal to such amount from the amount owed by Parent pursuant to the Note.

  



  

(c) For clarification of the above, it is the intent of the
parties that at the Effective Time the Working Capital shall be at least
equal to the Required Working Capital as of the Closing Date. If any payment
owed pursuant to this _Section 1.9_ is not made when due pursuant to
_Section 1.9(b)_, interest shall accrue on the amount outstanding at the rate
of five percent (5%) per annum until final payment is made.

  



  

1.10 _Merger Consideration Adjustment (WIP Adjustment)_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practical after the end of each of the first
two calendar years following Closing Date and then after the commencement of
the warranty period under all Contracts entered into before the close of
business on the Closing Date (collectively, the " _WIP Projects_ "), Parent
shall perform an analysis with respect to the WIP Projects (each such analysis
prepared after the end of a calendar year and after the completion of all
such Contracts, the " _WIP Analysis_ "). Each WIP Analysis shall show the
amount by which the Company's net earnings as of the Closing were overstated
or understated by reason of any improper accruals of revenue and expenses on
the WIP Projects as of the Closing for such period (as if the final amounts
had been known as of the Closing) (the " _WIP Adjustment_ "). Each WIP
Adjustment shall be determined on an aggregate basis netting out over and
under accruals for such period. The WIP Adjustment shall be calculated on a
contract-by-contract for such period basis based on the methodology set forth
on Exhibit E attached hereto.

  



  

   

\- 8 -

 



    



  

(b) Within sixty (60) days after completion of each such period,
Parent shall provide the Stockholder Representative with its proposed
calculation of the applicable WIP Adjustment in writing by Parent to the
Stockholder Representative and delivered in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 8.2_ (each, the " _Proposed WIP Statement_ "), and the Stockholder
Representative shall either accept the applicable Proposed WIP Statement,
which will then be deemed final and binding on the parties, or certify to
Parent the Stockholder Representative's alternate calculation of the
applicable WIP Adjustment (each, the " _Stockholder Representative 's WIP
Statement_"). If the Stockholder Representative fails to accept the applicable
Proposed WIP Statement or deliver to the Parent the Stockholder
Representative's WIP Statement for such period within thirty (30) days of
receipt of the applicable Proposed WIP Statement, the applicable Proposed WIP
Statement shall be final and binding on the parties.

  



  

(c) If the Stockholder Representative timely delivers the
Stockholder Representative's WIP Statement for an applicable period, Parent
and the Stockholder Representative shall make good faith efforts to meet and
resolve any differences between the Proposed WIP Statement and the
Stockholder Representative's WIP Statement for such period. If within thirty
(30) days after receipt by Parent of the Stockholder Representative's WIP
Statement for such period, Parent and the Stockholder Representative
have been unable to reach agreement, either Parent or the Stockholder
Representative may engage the Accounting Firm to calculate the WIP
Adjustment, and request the Accounting Firm to make its determination within
thirty (30) days of its engagement. The WIP Adjustment determined by the
Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties; _provided_ , that
the WIP Adjustment amount calculated by the Accounting Firm shall be either
the WIP Adjustment amount set forth in the Proposed WIP Statement or the
Parent's WIP Statement for such period. The Accounting Firm shall certify its
decision in writing to Parent and the Stockholder Representative. The fees,
costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by (i) the Company
Stockholders if the Proposed WIP Statement is determined by the Accounting
Firm as the more accurate, or (ii) Parent if the Stockholder Representative's
WIP Statement is determined by the Accounting Firm as the more accurate.

  



  

(d) After a WIP Adjustment for an applicable period (each, the "
_Final WIP Adjustment_ ") has been determined as final and binding on the
parties, the following shall occur: if the Final WIP Adjustment for such
period is (i) a negative amount, the Company Stockholders shall (X) first
offset an amount equal to such amount (as a positive number) from the amount
owed by Parent pursuant to the Note and (Y) after the Note has been exhausted
or paid in full, pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent an amount equal to such
amount by wire transfer in immediately available funds within ten (10)
Business Days following the determination of the Final WIP Adjustment; and
(ii) a positive amount, Parent shall pay to the Company Stockholders, by
wire transfer in immediately available funds, within ten (10) Business Days
following the determination of the Final WIP Adjustment, the total amount
reflected by the Final WIP Adjustment less the aggregate amount of any
additional Change in Control Payments triggered as a result of the payment of
such Final WIP Adjustment. If any payment owed pursuant to this _Section
1.10_ is not made when due, interest shall accrue on the amount outstanding
at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum until final payment is made.

1.11 _Payment Procedures_.

  



  

(a) _Closing Payments_. As promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time, Parent shall distribute the Closing Cash Merger
Consideration to Company Stockholders in accordance with the Payment
Spreadsheet. All interest and other earnings from any investment of
funds held from time to time with respect to the Merger Consideration shall
be the sole and exclusive property of Parent, and no part of such interest or
other earnings shall accrue to or for the benefit of any Company Stockholders.

  



  

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Prior to the Closing and after
receiving the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company shall mail to each
Company Stockholder a letter of transmittal in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit F (a " _Transmittal Letter_ "), which Transmittal
Letter shall (A) specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the certificate(s) representing shares of the Company Capital Stock
(the " _Certificates_ ") that are being converted into the right to receive
payment pursuant to _Section 1.7_ shall pass, only upon delivery of such
Certificates to the Parent (B) include an agreement that such holder shall
receive its portion of the Merger Consideration to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)(i)_, (C) be in such form and have such
other reasonable provisions not inconsistent with this Agreement as Parent
may specify, (D) include IRS Form W-9 or Form W-8BEN or any successor form,
and (E) include instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates for that portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof under this Agreement. The payment of the appropriate Stockholder
Closing Payment to any Company Stockholder is expressly conditioned upon the
execution and delivery of a Transmittal Letter, properly completed and duly
executed by each such Company Stockholder. After the Effective Time, and
within five (5) business days after Parent receives a Certificate, properly
endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer, formerly representing
shares of Company Capital Stock held by any Company Stockholder immediately
prior to the Effective Time, together with a properly completed and duly
executed Transmittal Letter, Parent shall pay to such Company Stockholder (A)
that portion of the Merger Consideration payable to such Company Stockholder
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement in respect of the shares of
Company Capital Stock formerly represented by such Certificates, less (B)
that portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to such Company
Stockholder in respect of such shares of Company Capital Stock that is
required to be withheld from such Company Stockholder under applicable Tax
withholding laws, if any, (such amount less such deductions, with respect to
each such Company Stockholder, being referred to herein as the " _Stockholder
Closing Payment_ "), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. If payment of any portion of the applicable Stockholder Closing
Payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificates are registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that the Person requesting such payment (A) shall have paid any transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of those amounts to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, and shall
have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been
paid, or (B) shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax is not applicable. From and after the Effective Time, until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 1.11(b)_ each Certificate shall be deemed to
represent for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable portion
of the Merger Consideration, if any, in respect of the shares of Company
Capital Stock formerly represented thereby in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and in the manner provided herein.

  



  

   

\- 10 -

 



    



  

(c) _No Liability_. The Company Stockholders shall be entitled to
look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Legal Requirements), and only as general creditors thereof, with respect to
the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of any
shares of Company Capital Stock that have not be properly tendered pursuant to
the provisions of _Section 1.11(b)_, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any Company Stockholder for any amounts delivered to a
public official pursuant to and in compliance with any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Legal Requirement. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by a Company Stockholder one (1) year after the Effective Time (or
such earlier date (if any), which is immediately prior to such time when the
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(d) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
payment of any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to any Person
under this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
other applicable Legal Requirements. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid. To the extent that such amounts are not so deducted
and withheld, such Person shall indemnify Parent and its affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation), for any amounts imposed by a
Governmental Authority, together with any related Losses.

  



  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Instruments_. In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making and
delivery of an affidavit of that fact by the Company Stockholder in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent (a  " _Lost Instrument Affidavit_
"), Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall pay such
Company Stockholder the portion of the Merger Consideration to which such
Company Stockholder is entitled to pursuant to _Section 1.7_;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may, in its sole discretion and as a condition
precedent, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates
to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, and/or a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably
direct as indemnity, against any claim that may be made against Parent or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed (the " _Lost Instrument Indemnity Agreement_ ").

4.15 _Tax Matters_.

(i) The Stockholder Representative, at the cost and expense of the
Company, shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and shall timely file, or
cause to be filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period (the " _Company Prepared Returns_ "). Such Company
Prepared Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with existing
procedures and practices and accounting methods, and, to the extent
applicable, the conventions provided in _Section 4.15(a)(iv)_. The
Stockholder Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide copies of such Company Prepared Returns to Parent and its authorized
representatives for review at least thirty (30) days prior to the filing
thereof, and shall make such revisions to such Company Prepared Returns as

shall cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to sign and timely file the
Company Prepared Return in the form submitted by the Stockholder
Representative. The Company Stockholders shall pay or cause to be paid all
Taxes with respect to such periods and such Tax Returns (excluding any Taxes

Stockholders Parent may in its sole discretion elect to offset an amount
equal to such amount from the amount owed by Parent pursuant to the Note.

  



  

   

\- 37 -

 



    

  



  

(ii) Parent, at its sole cost and expense, shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to prepare and timely file all Tax Returns of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all Post-Closing Tax Periods, including for
such purposes, any Straddle Period (the " _Parent Prepared Returns_ ")
provided Parent Prepared Returns shall exclude Form 1120 to be filed by or on
behalf of the Company for its final tax period before entering the
consolidated group of Parent. Parent shall utilize (and cause the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries to utilize) mutually agreed accounting firm to
prepare the Tax Returns for any Straddle Period of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. To the extent that a Parent Prepared Return relates to a
Straddle Period, such Tax Return shall be prepared on a basis consistent with
existing procedures and practices and accounting methods of the Company and
its Subsidiaries in effect as of the Closing Date to the extent permitted by
applicable law, using the same tax preparers as were used prior to the
Closing and, to the extent applicable, the conventions provided in _Section
4.15(a)(iv)_. At least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of any Parent
Prepared Return that relates to a Straddle Period, Parent shall provide a
draft of such Tax Return to the Stockholder Representative for the
Stockholder Representative's review and comment. Parent shall make
such revisions to such Parent Prepared Returns as are reasonably requested by
Stockholder Representative at least ten (10) days prior to the filing due
date with respect thereto.

  



  

(iii) Except as required by law, Parent shall not, and shall not
allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, file or amend any Tax
Return of the Company or its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period or otherwise initiate (or otherwise participate in) any other
Company Approved Tax Matter without the prior written permission of the
Stockholder Representative.

  



  

(iv) Parent and the Stockholder Representative agree with respect
to certain Tax matters as follows:

  



  

(A) That no election shall be made to waive the carry back of Tax
credit incurred or realized in a Pre-Closing Tax Period by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries; and

  



  

(B) To treat any indemnification payments as adjustments to the
Merger Consideration for all relevant Tax purposes.

  



  

Unless otherwise required by a determination of a Governmental Authority that
is final, Parent shall not (and Parent shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries not to) file a Tax Return that is inconsistent with any
agreement pursuant to this _Section 4.15(a)(iv)_, and Parent shall not (and
Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to) take any position
during the course of any Tax Contest or other audit or proceedings that is
inconsistent with any agreement pursuant to this _Section 4.15(a)(iv)_.

  



  

   

\- 38 -

 



    



  

(b) _Straddle Period Tax Returns_. To the extent it is not
permitted or required in a jurisdiction to elect (which election shall be
made, if permitted) to have each Tax year of the Company and its Subsidiaries
end on the Closing Date, such that the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries
is required to file a Tax Return for a Straddle Period, the parties agree to
use the following conventions for determining the amount of Taxes
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date: (i) in the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis, the amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date shall be determined by multiplying the Taxes for
the entire Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the
entire Straddle Period; and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes (including
income Taxes, sales Taxes, employment Taxes and withholding Taxes), the amount
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall be determined as if the applicable Company and/or its Subsidiary filed
a separate Tax Return with respect to such Taxes for the portion of the
Straddle Period ending as of the end of the day on the Closing Date using a
"closing of the books methodology." For purposes of the foregoing, (A) any
item determined on an annual or periodic basis (including amortization and
depreciation deductions) shall be allocated to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date based on the relative number of
days in such portion of the Straddle Period as compared to the number of days
in the entire Straddle Period; (B) any Tax or item of income, gain, loss,
deduction or credit resulting from a Parent Closing Date Transaction shall be
allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period beginning on the day after the
Closing Date; and (C) any item of deduction attributable to any Transaction
Deductions shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Stockholder Representative
and Parent shall (and Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
to) (i) assist in the preparation and timely filing of any Tax Return of the
Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) assist in any audit or other proceeding
with respect to the Tax Returns or Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries;
(iii) make available any information, records, or other documents relating to
any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (iv)
provide any information required to allow the Parent, the Company and its
Subsidiaries to comply with any information reporting contained in the Code
or other applicable Laws; and (v) provide certificates or forms, and timely
execute any Tax Returns, that are necessary or appropriate to establish an
exemption for (or reduction in) any Transfer Tax. All obligations of all
Persons under this _Section 4.15(c)_ shall end after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations from all periods or portions thereof that
include the Closing Date or any prior date.

  



  

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. The Company Stockholders will pay, and will
indemnify and hold Parent harmless against, any documentary, stamp,
stock transfer, or similar Tax imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the Company Stockholders as a result of the Merger and any
related penalties or interest (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ").

  



  

   

\- 39 -

 



    



  

(e) _Tax Contests_.

  



  

(i) If any Governmental Authority issues to Parent or the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (1) a notice of its intent to audit or conduct
another proceeding with respect to a Tax Return or Taxes of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period or (2)
a notice of deficiency for Taxes for any such period, Parent shall notify the
Stockholder Representative of its receipt of such communication from the
Governmental Authority within ten (10) days of receipt and provide the
Stockholder Representative with copies of all correspondence and other
documents received from the Governmental Authority. The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall control any audit or other proceeding in respect of any
Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a " _Tax
Contest_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , (1) the Stockholder Representative, at
the sole cost and expense of the Company Stockholders, shall have the right to
control (including the settlement or resolution thereof and the selection of
counsel) or participate in any Tax Contest to the extent it relates to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period and participate in any Tax Contest to the extent it
relates to a Straddle Period; and (2) Parent shall not, and shall cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, settle, resolve, or abandon a Tax
Contest (whether or not the Stockholder Representative participates in or
controls such Tax Contest) for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period
without the prior written permission of the Stockholder Representative (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned).

  



  

(ii) If the Stockholder Representative elects to control a Tax
Contest for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (1) the Stockholder
Representative shall notify Parent of such intent; (2) Parent shall promptly
complete and execute, and promptly cause the Company or its Subsidiaries or
other Affiliates, as applicable, to complete and execute, any powers of
attorney or other documents and take other reasonable actions that the
Stockholder Representative requests to allow the Stockholder Representative to
control such Tax Contest; (3) prior to the Stockholder Representative taking
control, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries, to
control such Tax Contest diligently and in good faith and after the
Stockholder Representative takes control, the Stockholder Representative
shall control such Tax Contest in good faith; and (4) while it controls a Tax
Contest, the Stockholder Representative shall (A) keep Parent reasonably
informed regarding the status of such Tax Contest; (B) allow Parent and the
Company and its Subsidiaries, at the Parent's sole cost and expense, to
participate in such Tax Contest; and (C) not settle, resolve, or abandon any
such Tax Contest if such settlement, resolution, or abandonment would result
in any Parent Indemnitee incurring any material Tax that the Company
Stockholders are not obligated to pay or indemnify under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed, or conditioned).

  



  

(iii) If the Stockholder Representative elects to participate in a
Tax Contest, (1) the Stockholder Representative shall notify Parent of such
intent; (2) Parent shall control, or cause the Company and its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, to control, such Tax Contest diligently and in good faith; (3)
Parent shall (and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to) promptly
take all actions necessary to allow the Stockholder Representative (and its
counsel) to fully participate in such Tax Contest; and (4) if requested by
the Stockholder Representative, Parent shall settle (or cause the Company or
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to settle) the Tax Contest on terms
acceptable to the Governmental Authority and the Stockholder Representative (
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that such settlement will not result in any Parent
Indemnitee incurring any material Tax that the Company Stockholders are not
required to pay under this Agreement).

  



  

   

\- 40 -

 



    



  

(iv) If the Stockholder Representative does not control or
participate in a Tax Contest (whether by election or otherwise) that
relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, (1) Parent shall
control, or cause the applicable Company or Subsidiary, to control such Tax
Contest diligently and in good faith; (2) Parent shall keep the Stockholder
Representative reasonably informed regarding the status of such Tax Contest;
and (3) if requested by the Stockholder Representative, Parent shall
settle (or cause the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to settle)
the Tax Contest on terms acceptable to the applicable Governmental Authority
and the Stockholder Representative ( _provided_ , _however_ , that such

Taxes that the Company Stockholders are not required to pay under this
Agreement).

  



  

(f) _Tax Refunds_. All refunds of Taxes (including refunds of
Transfer Taxes) of Parent or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a
" _Tax Refund_ " and, collectively, " _Tax Refunds_ ") for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (or portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date as
determined in accordance with the same principles provided for in _Section
4.15(b)_) (whether in the form of cash received or a credit or offset against
Taxes otherwise payable) shall be the property of the Company Stockholders to
the extent such Tax Refund was not included as an asset in the computation of
the Final Working Capital or arises as a result of a Transaction Deduction.
To the extent that Parent or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries receives a
Tax Refund that is the property of the Company Stockholders, Parent shall pay
to the Company Stockholders the amount of such Tax Refund (and interest
received from the Governmental Authority) less all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs associated with obtaining such Tax Refund incurred by Parent and/or the
Company. The amount due to the Company Stockholders shall be payable to the
Company Stockholders ten (10) days after receipt of the Tax Refund from the
applicable Governmental Authority (or, if the Tax Refund is in the form of
credit or offset, ten (10) days after the due date of the Tax Return claiming
such credit or offset). Parent shall cooperate with Stockholder
Representative to claim (and cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable to claim) any refunds that will give rise to a payment to, or on
behalf of, the Company Stockholders under this _Section 4.15(f)_.

information to, any Person in connection with, or the making of any proposal
that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal. Upon execution of this Agreement,
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall cease immediately and cause to be
terminated any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons
conducted heretofore with respect to an Acquisition Proposal other than in
connection with the Merger.

  



  

4.17 _Indemnified Receivables Title Transfer_. If the Company
Stockholders indemnify Parent pursuant to _Section 6.2(f)_ for Indemnified
Receivables, then Parent shall promptly transfer to the Stockholder
Representative (for the benefit of the Company Stockholders) title to such
Indemnified Receivables and the Stockholder Representative may seek to collect
such Indemnified Receivables;  _ _provided__ , __however__ , that the
Stockholder Representative is obligated to exercise reasonable care
with regard to the overall continuing business interests of the Company and
Parent in attempting to collect such Indemnified Receivables.

4.18 _Employees_. Parent may, in its sole discretion, continue
any Company Benefit Plan or employee policy or program in effect immediately
prior to the Closing Date (each a " _Pre-Merger Plan_ "), including a 401(k)
plan or medical plan, for any period of time after the Closing for the
benefit of any employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively,
the " _Company Employees_ " and, each individually, a " _Company Employee_
"). To the extent Parent does not continue a Pre-Merger Plan applicable to a
Company Employee, such Company Employee shall be eligible, subject to the
provisions herein, to participate in any corresponding Employee Benefit Plan
maintained by Parent providing benefits to any Company Employee after the
Closing Date (the " _Post-Merger Plans_ ") to the extent such Post-Merger Plan
replaces similar coverage under such Pre-Merger Plan. Parent will, or will
cause its Subsidiaries to, give Company Employees full credit under any such
Post-Merger Plan for their years of service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to the same extent recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary
under the corresponding Pre-Merger Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date
for purposes of eligibility and vesting (excluding vesting in equity based
awards, eligibility for post-employment welfare benefits and benefit accruals,
including without limitation, any benefit accruals under any defined benefit
person plan that is a tax qualified plan under Code Section 401(a)). Except
as set forth on _Schedule 4.18_ , the value of the compensation and benefits
provided under the Pre-Merger Plans or the Post-Merger Plans, as applicable
in accordance with the foregoing, to Company Employees, taken as a whole,
after the Closing Date shall be substantially equivalent to the value of the
compensation and benefits provided under the Company Benefit
Plans (determined without regard to awards under the Company Incentive Plans)
to the Company Employees, taken as a whole, immediately prior to the Closing
Date. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i)
each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all Post-Merger Plans to the extent coverage
under such Post-Merger Plan replaces coverage under any Pre-Merger Plan;
provided, however, to the extent such Company Employee is not covered by a
Pre-Merger Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date due to failure to
satisfy the applicable waiting period, such Company Employee shall be subject
to the waiting time applicable to a Parent employee with respect to the
corresponding Post-Merger Plan that replaces such Pre-Merger Plan (giving
full service credit for service by such Company Employee with the Company in
satisfying such waiting time); provided further, to the extent a Company
Employee is covered by a Pre-Merger Plan but does not satisfy the service
requirements for the corresponding Post-Merger Plan, the Post-Merger Plan may
allow such Company Employee to participate in such Post-Merger Plan or Parent
shall continue the Pre-Merger Plan for such Company Employee or otherwise
provide comparable substitute coverage; and (ii) for purposes of each Post-
Merger Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits
to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Post-Merger Plan to be
waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, and Parent
shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Pre-
Merger Plan ending on the date such Company Employee's participation in the
corresponding Post-Merger Plan begins to be taken into account under such
Post-Merger Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such Post-Merger Plan. Nothing in
this Agreement shall constitute an amendment to, or be construed as amending,
any Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

(j) Fraud.

  



  

6.3 _Indemnification of the Stockholder Indemnitees_. From and
after the Closing Date, and subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement, Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold each of the Company
Stockholders, the Stockholder Representative and their respective successors
and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Stockholder Indemnitees_ ")
harmless from, against and in respect of any Losses sustained or incurred by
such Stockholder Indemnitee to the extent relating to, resulting from, or
arising out of, or of any allegation by any third party of:

  



  

(a) the failure of any representations or warranties contained in

(b) any breach, nonfulfillment or noncompliance by Parent of any

6.4 _Limitations on Indemnification of Parent Indemnitees_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the rights of Parent
Indemnitees to indemnification under this Agreement are limited as follows:

  



  

   

\- 48 -

 



    



  

(a) _Basket; Cap_. Parent Indemnitees will not be entitled to
recover any Losses pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_, _(b)_ (except for any
breach, nonfulfillment or noncompliance of or with the obligations set forth
in _Sections 4.14_ ), _(d)_ or (g) until the total of all such Losses
suffered by Parent Indemnitees exceeds $300,000 (the " _Basket_ "), in which
event Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover all Losses in excess of
the Basket up to a maximum of the RandW Liability Cap; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing limitations will not apply to claims in respect of
breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 2.1_
(Organization; Good Standing; Qualification and Power),  _2.2_
(Capitalization), _2.4_ (Power and Authority) or _2.17_ (Taxes) or claims
based on Fraud. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, for individual Losses,
the aggregate amount of such Loss for which any Company Stockholder shall be
liable pursuant to Section 6.2 shall be the lesser of (i) its Pro Rata
Percentage of such Loss or (ii) the portion of the Merger Consideration which
such Company Stockholder was actually paid. For avoidance of doubt, the
aggregate amount of all Losses for which any Company Stockholder shall be
liable pursuant to Section 6.2 shall be the portion of the Merger
Consideration which such Company Stockholder was actually paid.

  



  

(b) _Reduction; Subrogation_. Parent Indemnitees' right to
indemnification or reimbursement pursuant to this Agreement on account of any
Losses shall be reduced by (i) all insurance or other proceeds recovered by
Parent Indemnitees from third parties, including pursuant to indemnification
obligations of third parties in favor of the Company or its Subsidiaries in
each case, net of (x) any related costs and expenses, including the costs and
expenses of pursuing any such claims, and (y) any deductibles and
any increase in premiums in connection with any such claims (such amount, the
" _Net Settlement Amount_ "), and (ii) any accruals or reserves on the
Financial Statements or the calculation of Company's Working Capital with
respect to which such Losses relate and (iii) any Taxes included in the
definition of Transaction Expense with respect to which such Losses
relate. If any Parent Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) receives any Net Settlement Amount after
receiving an indemnification payment for the related Loss, Parent shall pay to
the Company Stockholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Percentages the amount of such proceeds to the extent such proceeds did not
reduce the indemnity payment for the Loss within ten (10) days of the receipt
of such proceeds.

  



  

(c) _No Claims_. Parent Indemnitees shall not have any claim for
Losses under this Agreement (i) to the extent that any Liability or
obligation arises as a result of any action taken or omitted to be taken by
Parent, and after the Closing Date, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, (ii) in respect of any Losses caused by or resulting from any
action required or permitted by this Agreement (including _Section 4.1_) and
(iii) to the extent such claim for Losses was specifically reflected in the
Final WC Statement or was resolved pursuant to the post-Closing Cash Merger
Consideration adjustment procedures set forth in _Section 1.8_, _1.9_ or
_1.10_. Parent Indemnitees shall not be indemnified for the same Loss more
than once under this Agreement, even if a claim for indemnification in respect
of such Loss has been made as a result of a breach of more than one
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement.

  



  

   

\- 49 -

 



    



  

(d) _Knowledge of Breach_. The right to indemnification in
accordance with the provisions of this _Article 6_ will not be affected by
any investigation conducted by Parent or its representatives with respect to,
or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by Parent or its
representatives at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant,
or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty (as may be modified by any Disclosure Schedule),
or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will
not affect the right to indemnification in accordance with the provisions of
this _Article 6_, unless such waiver expressly states that it includes a
waiver of rights to indemnification under this _Article 6_. No party shall
be required to demonstrate the actual or constructive knowledge of any other
party as a condition of indemnification for any claim.

  



  

(e) _Materiality Scrape_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, for the purposes of determining the amount of any Losses, but not
liability for indemnification, with respect to any breach of any
representation or warranty, any qualifications by the words "Material Adverse
Effect" and "material" shall be disregarded.

  



  

6.5 _Exclusive Remedy; Express Negligence_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, except with respect to the matters set forth in
_Sections 1.8_ , _1.9_ and _1.10_ and other than in the case of Fraud, the
parties agree that, from and after the Closing Date, the sole and exclusive
remedies of the parties to this Agreement and Parent Indemnitees and the
Stockholder Indemnitees, respectively, for any Losses (including any Losses
from claims for breach of Contract, warranty, tortuous conduct (including
negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, equity,
statute, strict liability, or otherwise) arising out of or based upon the
matters set forth in this Agreement and the Merger, are the indemnification
obligations of the parties set forth in this _Article 6_. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each of the parties hereby waives, from and after the Closing
Date, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights
and claims for Losses it may have against any other party arising under,
based upon or relating to this Agreement, any applicable Law, common law or
otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this _Article 6_). The provisions of this _Section 6.5 _shall not, however,
prevent or limit a cause of action under _Section 8.13_ to obtain an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof. THE INDEMNITIES SET
FORTH IN THIS _ARTICLE 6 _ARE INTENDED TO BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE PARTIES
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPRESS TERMS AND SCOPE THEREOF, REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER ANY PARTY (INCLUDING THE PARTY FROM WHOM INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT)
ALLEGES OR PROVES THE CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE OF
THE PARTY SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION OR THE CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED
UPON THE PARTY SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT BY SUCH PARTY. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING,
NO PARTY SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE TO INDEMNIFY THE OTHER PARTY FOR THE VALUE
ASSIGNED TO SUCH OTHER PARTY'S CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE
NEGLIGENCE.

  



  

   

\- 50 -

 



    



  

6.6 _Procedures_. The following procedures shall apply to all
claims for indemnification and reimbursement pursuant to this _Article
6_, other than those relating to Tax matters, which are governed by _Section
4.14_:

  



  

(a) _Notice of Losses by Parent Indemnitee_.

  



  

(i) _Indemnity Claims_. Subject to the limitations set forth in
this Agreement, if any Parent Indemnitee believes in good faith that it has a
claim for indemnification (an " _Indemnity Claim_ "), Parent shall, promptly
after it becomes aware of such Indemnity Claim but in any event prior to the
Indemnification Termination Date, notify the Stockholder Representative of
such Indemnity Claim by means of a written notice specifying the nature,
circumstances and amount of such Indemnity Claim accompanied by an
affidavit of an officer of Parent setting forth with reasonable particularity
the underlying facts actually known or in good faith believed by the affiant
to exist sufficient to establish, as of the date of such affidavit, the basis
for the Indemnity Claim and setting forth the Parent's good faith calculation
of the Losses incurred by the applicable Parent Indemnitee with
respect thereto, and including copies of all written documentation in the
possession of Parent Indemnitees relating to the circumstances or events
giving rise to such Indemnity Claim (an " _Indemnity Claim Notice_ "). The
failure by Parent to promptly deliver an Indemnity Claim Notice under this
_Section 6.6(a)(i)_ will not adversely affect the applicable
Parent Indemnitee's right to recovery except to the extent that the
Stockholder Representative or any Company Stockholder is
materially prejudiced thereby.

  



  

(ii) _No Disputes_. If Parent delivers an Indemnity Claim Notice
in accordance with the terms in _Section 6.6(a)(i)_ and the Stockholder
Representative does not object to the terms of the Indemnity Claim as set
forth in the applicable Indemnity Claim Notice, (A) the Stockholder
Representative and Parent shall mutually agree to an offset against the Note
in the amount set forth in such Indemnity Claim Notice and (B) after the Note
has been exhausted or paid in full, each Company Stockholder shall pay (or
cause to be paid) to Parent such Company Stockholder's Pro Rata Percentage of
such amount by wire transfer in immediately available funds within ten (10)
Business Days.

  



  

(iii) _Disputes_. If Parent delivers an Indemnity Claim Notice in
accordance with the terms in _Section 6.6(a)(i)_ and the
Stockholder Representative objects to the terms of the Indemnity Claim as set
forth in the applicable Indemnity Claim Notice, the
Stockholder Representative may dispute the related Indemnity Claim by
delivery of a notice to Parent in writing, within thirty (30) days
following the Stockholder Representative's receipt of such Indemnity Claim
Notice, that the Stockholder Representative objects to the Indemnity Claim
(or the amount of Losses set forth therein) asserted in such Indemnity Claim
Notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ "). Following receipt by Parent of the Dispute
Notice, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly use their
reasonable efforts to settle the dispute as to whether and to what extent
Parent Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification on account of such
Indemnity Claim. If Parent and the Stockholder Representative are unable to
reach agreement within thirty (30) days after Parent receives such Dispute
Notice, then the dispute must first be submitted to non-binding mediation to
be held in Houston, Texas. If Parent and the Stockholder Representative are
still unable to reach agreement within forty-five (45) days after the first
(1st) meeting with the mediator, then the dispute may only be submitted to,
and settled by, an individual arbitrator mutually selected by the Stockholder
Representative and Parent (if the Stockholder Representative and Parent are
unable to agree upon the arbitrator, they shall each select an arbitrator and
the two selected arbitrators shall appoint a third arbitrator to act as the
arbitrator). The arbitration shall be held in Houston, Texas pursuant to the
Federal Arbitration Act and in accordance with the then-prevailing
International Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The
agreement to arbitrate will be specifically enforceable, the award rendered
by the arbitrator in respect of a dispute pursuant to this _Section
6.6(a)(iii)_ shall be final and binding (absent intentional Fraud or manifest
error), and any arbitration award may be enforced by judgment entered in any
court of competent jurisdiction. The fees and expenses of the mediator and the
arbitrator shall be allocated between the Company Stockholders, on the one
hand, and Parent, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate
amount of the disputed items submitted to the mediator or arbitrator, as the
case may be, that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally
determined by the arbitrator) bears to the total amount of such disputed items
so submitted. For all purposes of this  _Article 6_, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall reasonably cooperate with the other party and
its representatives (including to the extent appropriate and permitted by
applicable Law, providing information, records and data), and shall permit
reasonable access to its facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably
required in connection with the resolution of such disputes.

  



  

   

\- 51 -

 



    



  

(b) _Notice of Losses Provided by Stockholder Indemnitee_. As
soon as is reasonably practicable after a Stockholder Indemnitee
obtains knowledge of any matter which has or may result in Losses, such
Stockholder Indemnitee shall give written notice of such matter (a " _Claims
Notice_ ") to Parent describing the matter in reasonable detail, and indicate
the amount (estimated, if necessary and to the extent feasible) of the Losses
that have been or may be suffered by the applicable Stockholder
Indemnitee. No delay in or failure to give a Claims Notice by such
Stockholder Indemnitee to Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.6(b)_
will adversely affect any of the other rights or remedies that such
Stockholder Indemnitee has under this Agreement, or alter or relieve Parent
or the Company of their obligation to indemnify the applicable Stockholder
Indemnitee except to the extent that they are materially prejudiced thereby.

  



  

(c) _Opportunity to Defend Third Party Claims_. In the event of
any claim by a third party against any Parent Indemnitee or Stockholder
Indemnitee for which indemnification is or may be available under this
_Article 6_ (whether pursuant to a lawsuit, other legal action or otherwise,
a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the party against whom indemnification may be
sought hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") shall be entitled and, if it
so elects, shall at its own cost and expense, (i) take control of the defense
and investigation of such Third Party Claim and (ii) pursue the defense
thereof in good faith by appropriate actions or proceedings promptly taken or
instituted and diligently pursued, including to employ and engage attorneys of
its own choice reasonably acceptable to the party seeking indemnification
hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to handle and defend such Third Party
Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled (but not obligated), if it
so elects, to compromise or settle such claim, which compromise or settlement
shall be made only with the written consent of the Indemnified Party,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the
event the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of the defense and
investigation of such Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section
6.6(c)_, the Indemnified Party may, at its own cost and expense, participate
in the investigation, trial and defense of such Third Party Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
in accordance with this _Section 6.6(c)_ within fourteen (14) days after
delivery of the Claim Notice in connection with such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party against which such Third Party Claim has been asserted
shall (upon delivering notice to such effect to the Indemnifying Party) have
the right to undertake the defense, compromise and settlement of such Third
Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any resulting
settlement of such Third Party Claim and for any final judgment with respect
thereto (subject to any right of appeal), if any, but only to the extent
otherwise provided in this Agreement (including _Sections 6.4_ and _6.5_
hereof). In the event the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the
claim, the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party reasonably
informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement, and in
the event the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of the claim, the
Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the
progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement.

  



  

   

\- 52 -

 



    



  

(d) To the extent this _Section 6.6_ is inconsistent with
_Section 4.15(e)_ with respect to any Tax matter, the provisions of _Section
4.15(e)_ shall control.

  



  

6.7 _Mitigation_. Each party shall take all reasonable steps to
mitigate any of its Losses upon becoming aware of any event which would
reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto. Each of the parties
shall cooperate with the others with respect to resolving any claim or
liability with respect to which one party is obligated to indemnify the other
party hereunder, including by using reasonable best efforts to mitigate or
resolve any such claim or liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that such party
shall not be required to make such efforts if they would be detrimental in
any material respect to such party. In the event that any party shall fail to
use reasonable best efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or liability,
then (unless the proviso to the foregoing sentence shall be applicable)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the other party shall not be
required to indemnify or reimburse any Person for any Losses that could have
been avoided if such party had made such efforts.

8.3 _Exhibits and Schedules_. Any matter, information or item
disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule or in any Exhibit attached hereto, under
any specific representation or warranty or section number hereof, shall be
deemed to have been disclosed with respect to any other section or subsection
of this Agreement to which the matter relates, so long as the description of
such matter in the Disclosure Schedule reasonably indicates its relevance to
the pertinent section. The mere inclusion of any matter, information or item
in any Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty
shall not be deemed to constitute an admission of any liability by the
Company or any other Person to any third party or otherwise imply that any
such matter, information or item is material or creates a measure for
materiality for the purposes of this Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, no such inclusion of a possible breach or violation of any
Contract, Law or Order shall be construed as an admission or indication
that breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

  



  

8.4 _Amendment, Modification and Waiver_. Except as provided in
_Section 4.12_, this Agreement, including any Exhibit or the Disclosure
Schedule, may be amended, modified or supplemented at any time only by written
agreement signed by Parent and, if before the Closing, the Company, and if
after the Closing, the Stockholder Representative. Any failure of the Company
to comply with any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived by
Parent, and any failure of Parent to comply with any term or provision of
this Agreement may be waived by the Stockholder Representative, at any time by

waiver shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure to comply. Further, neither the waiver by any of
the parties of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this
Agreement, nor the failure by any of the parties, on one or more occasions,
to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right
or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other breach or
default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights
or privileges hereunder.

8.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule
and the Exhibits, and other documents referred to herein (including the
Confidentiality Agreement), and which form a part hereof, contain the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral and
written, with respect to its subject matter (other than the Confidentiality
Agreement).

  



  

8.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement for any reason is declared invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such
decision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any of the other
provisions of this Agreement, which other provisions shall remain in full
force and effect and the application of such invalid or unenforceable
provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable shall be valid and be enforced to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. Upon such declaration that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties to this Agreement shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Merger
be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  



  

8.7 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties and their respective heirs, executors, successors and permitted
assigns, but except as contemplated herein, neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, directly or
indirectly, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any party without the prior
written consent of the other parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Stockholder Representative may execute and deliver any such written consent on
behalf of the Company Stockholders. Any attempted assignment in violation of
this _Section 8.7_ shall be void.

  



  

8.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except (i) the Stockholder
Representative, (ii) current and former, stockholders, members, managers,
officers, directors and employees of the Company pursuant to _Section 4.13
_and (iii) as provided in _Article 6_ with respect to Parent Indemnitees and

upon any other Person (including any employee or former employee of the
Company) or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any specified
period, under or by reason of this Agreement.

8.11 _Interpretation_. The article and section headings contained
in this Agreement are solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the
agreement of the parties and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Any cost estimates, Projections or other
forward-looking statements contained or referred to in this Agreement or in
the Disclosure Schedule or Exhibits hereto or in any materials that have been
provided to Parent by or on behalf of the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates are not and shall not be deemed to be representations or
warranties of the Company. The words "include," "includes" and "including"
are deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation." The words,
"herein,"  "hereto," "hereof" and words of similar import refer to this
Agreement as a whole, including the Disclosure Schedule and any other
Schedules and Exhibits hereto, and not to any particular section, subsection,
paragraph, subparagraph or clause contained in this Agreement. The words
"party" or "parties" shall refer to parties to this Agreement. References
from or through any date mean, unless otherwise specified, from and including
or through and including, respectively. The words "dollar" or "$" shall mean
U.S. dollars. The word "threatened" or any variation thereof means
"threatened in writing". The word "day" means calendar day unless Business Day
is expressly specified. The term "written" in respect of Contracts shall be
interpreted to mean handwritten, typed or printed Contracts (as opposed to
oral) that have been executed by two counterparties pursuant to a handwritten
signature, and shall not be deemed executed by virtue of an oral, electronic
or email acknowledgement or signature. Any reference to the masculine,
feminine or neuter gender shall include such other genders and any reference
to the singular or plural shall include the other, in each case unless the
context otherwise requires. If any action under this Agreement is required to
be done or taken on a day that is not a Business Day, then such action shall
be required to be done or taken not on such day but on the first (1st)
succeeding Business Day thereafter. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
construed according to their fair meaning and neither for nor against any
party hereto irrespective of which party caused such provisions to be drafted.
Each of the parties acknowledges that it has been represented by counsel in
connection with the preparation and execution of this Agreement.

  



  

8.12 _Legal Representation_. Parent hereby agrees, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and each of their
respective directors, managers, stockholders, members, partners, officers and
employees, and each of their successors and assigns (all such parties, the "
_Waiving Parties_ "), that Porter Hedges and Goodwin Procter LLP (or any
successor thereof) (the  " _Law Firm_ ") may represent the Stockholder
Representative, the Company Stockholders and each of their
respective Affiliates (individually and collectively, the " _Seller Group_
"), on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand,
in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the other agreements contemplated hereby and the consummation
of the Merger and thereby (such representation, the " _Current Representation_
"), and the Law Firm may represent the Seller Group or any director, member,
partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the Seller Group, in each case in
connection with any dispute, litigation, claim, proceeding or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including under _Sections 1.8_
, _1.9_ and _1.10_ and _Article 6_, any agreements contemplated by this
Agreement or the Merger or thereby (any such representation, the " _Post-
Closing Representation_ ") notwithstanding such representation (or any
continued representation) of the Company, its Subsidiaries, and Parent on
behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and
irrevocably waives (and will not assert) any conflict of interest or any
objection arising therefrom or relating thereto. Parent acknowledges that the
foregoing provision applies whether or not the Law Firm provides legal
services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date.
Parent, for itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby irrevocably acknowledges
and agrees that all communications between the Seller Group and their counsel,
including the Law Firm, made in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution, delivery and performance under, or any dispute or
proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any agreements
contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger, or any matter relating to any
of the foregoing, are privileged communications between the Seller Group and
such counsel and neither Parent, nor any Person purporting to act on behalf
of or through Parent or any of the Waiving Parties, will seek to obtain the
same by any process. From and after the Closing, Parent shall and shall cause
the Company to, on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties, waive and
not assert any attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication
between the Law Firm and any Person in the Seller Group occurring during the
Current Representation in connection with any Post-Closing Representation.

8.13 _Enforcement of Agreement_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that the parties do not perform
the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as
are required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with
the specific terms thereof or otherwise breach such provisions, and that money
damages would not be an adequate remedy, even if available. The parties
accordingly agree (on behalf of themselves and the third party beneficiaries
of this Agreement provided in _Section 8.8_) that, prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article 7_, the Company, the
Company Stockholders (and the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the
Company and the Company Stockholders) and Parent shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific
performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of
competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at
law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

  



  

8.14 _Forum; Service of Process_. Each of the parties submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Houston,
Texas, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, agrees that all claims in respect of the action or proceeding may
be heard and determined in any such court and agrees not to bring any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other
court. Each of the parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond,
surety or other security that might be required of any other party with
respect thereto. Each of the parties agrees that service of summons and
complaint or any other process that might be served in any action or
proceeding may be made on such party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the party to be served at the address of the party and in the
manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section 8.2_; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section 8.14_ shall affect the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. Each party
hereto agrees that a final, non-appealable judgment in any action or
proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY

AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT OR TO ANY
OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE MERGER. IN THE EVENT OF

will, as a result of the Merger, be entitled to receive a portion of the
Merger Consideration as a holder of Company Capital Stock; and

  



  

WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent and Merger Sub to complete the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, the
Holder is willing to enter into this Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Representations and Warranties of the Holder_. The Holder hereby represents and warrants to each of Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  



  

   

B-7

 



    



  

(a) _Organization and Standing_. If the Holder is an entity, the
Holder is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization.

     



  

(b) _Authority_.

  



  

(i) If an entity, the Holder has all requisite power and authority
or, if an individual, the Holder has the capacity to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Holder and the consummation
by the Holder of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of the Holder, and no further
action is required on the part of the Holder to authorize this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Holder and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the other party hereto, constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of the Holder enforceable against the Holder in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Legal Requirements now or
hereafter in effect relating to creditors\' rights generally and subject to
general principles of equity.

  



  

(ii) The execution and delivery by the Holder of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
conflict with or result in any violation of or default under (with or without
notice or lapse of time or both), or give rise to any payment obligation or a
right of termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any
obligation or loss of any benefit under, (A) if applicable, any provision of
the organizational documents of the Holder, each as amended to date and
currently in effect; or (B) any Contract to which the Holder is a party or by
which any of the Holder\'s properties or assets may be bound; or (C) any
Legal Requirement applicable to the Holder or any of the Holder\'s properties
or assets (whether tangible or intangible). There is no Contract to which the
Holder is a party or by which any of Holder's properties or assets may be
bound which would prevent the carrying out of the transactions contemplated
hereby or by the Merger Agreement or the agreements contemplated hereby or
thereby, including the compliance by Holder with the provisions of the Merger
Agreement applicable to Indemnifying Parties in their capacity as such.

  



  

(c) _Ownership of Company Capital Stock_. The Holder is the sole
record and beneficial owner of, and has the sole right to vote (as
applicable) and to dispose of, the Company Capital Stock set forth on the
signature page hereto (subject to, in the case of individuals, applicable
community property laws, if any), and such Company Capital Stock (and any
shares of Company Capital Stock issuable upon exercise, exchange or
conversion of such Company Capital Stock) are, other than as provided in the
Terminated Contracts (as defined below), and as of the Closing will be, free
and clear of any pledge, lien, security interest, mortgage, charge,
claim, equity, option, proxy, voting restriction, voting trust or agreement,
understanding, arrangement, right of first refusal, limitation on
disposition, adverse claim of ownership or use or encumbrance of any kind.
Neither such Company Capital Stock (and any shares of Company Capital Stock
issuable upon exercise, exchange or conversion of such Company Capital Stock)
nor any respective interest therein has been sold, assigned, endorsed,
transferred, pledged, pawned, hypothecated, deposited under any agreement or
disposed of in any manner by the Holder. The Company Capital Stock set forth
on the signature page hereto constitute the Holder's entire interest in
Company Capital Stock, and Holder does not own or hold, beneficially or of
record, any other Company Capital Stock.

     



  

   

B-2

 



    



  

(d) _Brokers and Finders_. No Person has acted on behalf of the
Holder or any of Holder's "affiliates" or "associates" (as those terms are
defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) in such
manner (other than Lazard Middle Market LLC on behalf of, and pursuant to the
terms of its engagement letter with, the Company) as to give rise to any valid
claim against Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective
affiliates for brokerage or finders' fees or agents' commissions, fees
related to investment banking or similar advisory services or any similar
charges in connection with this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, nor will
Parent, the Company or their respective affiliates incur, directly or
indirectly, any such liability based on arrangements made by or on behalf of
the Holder.

  



  

(e) _Reliance; Opportunity to Discuss; Access to Information_.
The Holder acknowledges and understands that the representations,
warranties and covenants by the Holder set forth herein and any covenants set
forth in the Merger Agreement applicable to the Holder in his, her or its
capacity as an Indemnifying Party are a material inducement for Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and shall be relied upon by Parent, the Company, and their
respective affiliates and counsel, and that substantial losses and damages
may be incurred by such Persons if the Holder's representations, warranties or
covenants set forth herein and any covenants set forth in the Merger
Agreement applicable to the Holder in his, her or its capacity as
an Indemnifying Party are inaccurate or are breached. The Holder has
carefully read this Agreement and the Merger Agreement, understands the scope
and effect of the provisions of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement, and
has discussed the requirements of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement
with the Holder's legal, tax, investment, financial, and/or other professional
advisors to the extent the Holder has deemed necessary. The Holder hereby
acknowledges and agrees that the Holder has had the opportunity to ask
questions of and obtain any additional information reasonably available to
Parent, the Company and Merger Sub with respect to this Agreement and the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and the
Holder has received all such information as the Holder deems necessary and
appropriate to enable the Holder to evaluate the risks and merits of this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, including the Merger, and Holder's indemnification obligations
under the terms of the Merger Agreement.

  



  

2. _Joinder as Party to the Merger Agreement_.

  



  

(a) The Holder hereby acknowledges and agrees that he, she or it
is a Company Stockholder for purposes of the Merger Agreement, a Payee for
purposes of the Note and a Seller for purposes of the Earn-Out Agreement and,
accordingly, agrees to be bound by, solely in the Holder's capacity as an
Company Stockholder, Payee or Seller, as appropriate, and as fully as though
the Holder were a signatory thereto, the terms of the Merger Agreement, Note
and Earn-Out Agreement expressly applicable to Company Stockholder, Payee or
Seller, as appropriate. In furtherance of and without limiting the foregoing,
the Holder further acknowledges and agrees that, as a Company Stockholder,
the Holder will be severally and not jointly liable with respect to the
indemnification obligations of the Company Stockholders in accordance with
the terms and conditions of, and subject to the limitations of, Article 6 of
the Merger Agreement; provided that, in the case of Fraud committed by such
Holder, there shall be no limit to the amount that may be recovered from the
Holder for losses arising from such Fraud.

  



  

   

B-3

 



    



  

(b) The Holder acknowledges and agrees that (i) at the Closing,
Parent shall issue the Note to the Stockholder Representative and deliver the
Stockholder Representative Expense Amount to the Stockholder Representative,
each pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement; (ii) the Holder shall be entitled to a portion of the Note and the
Stockholder Representative Expense Amount, if any, and in each case only as
and when such amount is payable to the Holder in accordance with the
provisions of the Merger Agreement or the Note; and (iii) the Holder's right
to receive any portion of the Note and/or the Stockholder Representative
Expense Amount are contingent rights that are subject to Sections 1.8, 1.9 and
1.10 of the Merger Agreement, as well as the indemnification and other
related provisions of the Merger Agreement.

  



  

3. _Stockholder Representative_. The Holder hereby agrees to (i) the appointment of Element as the Stockholder Representative and authorizes Element to act or refrain from acting and to exercise the power, authority and discretion as the Stockholder Representative under this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, Note and Earn-Out Agreement, and (ii) to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Note and the Earn Out Agreement, including without limitation the provisions regarding the Stockholder Representative in Section 8.17 thereof.

  



  

4. _Termination of Certain Agreements_. The Holder acknowledges and agrees that to the extent the Holder is a party to any Contract listed on _Annex A_ (each a _" Terminated Contract_" and collectively the _" Terminated Contracts_"), the Holder consents and agrees that each Terminated Contract shall be deemed amended by the Company and the "Requisite Holders" or the "Preferred Investor Approval", as applicable, and as such terms are defined in the respective Terminated Contracts, to permit the termination of the Terminated Contracts with the prior written notice of the "Requisite Holders" or the "Preferred Investor Approval", as applicable, in connection with the consummation of a change of control of the Company (which Holder acknowledges includes the Merger). The Holder consents and agrees (i) to the termination of each such Terminated Contract contingent upon the consummation of the Merger and effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and agrees that any rights and obligations the Holder may have under each such Terminated Contract shall terminate immediately prior to, but conditioned upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time, and (ii) that the terms of this Agreement shall, in the event of any conflict with the terms of any Terminated Contract, supersede such conflicting terms and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Holder hereby agrees that the Terminated Contracts are hereby amended to give effect to the foregoing). The Holder hereby waives, and agrees that it will take no action with regard to pursuing, any rights (including any notice rights) or claims pursuant to or arising under any such Terminated Contract. Furthermore, the Holder and the Company each hereby acknowledges and agrees that to the extent any Terminated Contract may, by its terms, only be amended or terminated pursuant to an agreement or other instrument, written or otherwise, between the Company and one or more other parties thereto, this Agreement, together with the other Joinder Agreements entered into by other holders of the Company's equity securities in connection with the Merger Agreement who are also parties to such Terminated Contract, shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument for purposes of satisfying the termination or amendment requirements set forth in any such Terminated Contract, and the Company hereby consents to each such termination.

  



  

   

B-4

 



    



  

5. _Confidentiality_. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Holder agrees to at all times keep confidential and not disclose (other than to his, her or its spouse, officers, directors, limited partners, shareholders, employees, attorneys and other advisors with a bona fide need to know; provided, that such Persons have agreed to confidentiality restrictions substantially consistent with those contained herein) (a) the existence, terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (b) matters regarding the interpretation, performance, breach or termination hereof or thereof, and (c) all confidential or proprietary information of the Company, including, without limitation, Intellectual Property used or owned by the Company, obtained by the Holder or its directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives prior to the Closing, except to the extent that (i) such information has otherwise been made public through no fault or action of the Holder; (ii) any such information that is reasonably necessary for enforcing the Holder's rights hereunder or thereunder is disclosed to any Governmental Authority in connection with any legal proceedings involving a dispute between the Holder and Parent; (iii) if the Holder is an investment fund or vehicle, the Holder may disclose such information to its affiliates and its affected partners, members, managers, officers, investors and prospective investors; or (iv) the Holder is required by applicable Law to divulge or disclose any such information, in which case the Holder shall promptly notify Parent in writing in advance of disclosing such information and use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent to limit such disclosure to the extent so required by applicable Legal Requirements. In furtherance of, but subject to, the foregoing, Parent acknowledges that each institutional investor will report the economic terms of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to its current and prospective limited partners.

  



  

6. _General Release_. Effective for all purposes as of the Effective Time, the Holder acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of himself, herself or itself and each of the Holder's current or former affiliates, officers, directors, employees, managers, partners, principals, advisors, agents, stockholders, members, investors, equity holders or other representatives (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors), family members, heirs, beneficiaries, estates, executors, administrators, trustees, successors or assigns, in each case solely in their capacity as such (each, a " _Releasor_ ") that:

behalf of the Company, (6) rights under any other Contracts other than (x) the

B-6

 



    



  

(g) Releasor acknowledges that he, she or it is familiar with
Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California (" _Section
1542_"), which provides as follows:

  



  

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

  



  

(h) Releasor hereby waives and relinquishes any rights and
benefits that Releasor may have under Section 1542 or any similar statute
or common law principle of any jurisdiction. Releasor acknowledges that he,
she or it may hereafter discover facts in addition to or different from those
that Releasor now knows or believes to be true with respect to the subject
matter of this release, but it is Releasor's intention, subject to Section
6(b), to fully and finally and forever settle and release any and all Claims
that do now exist, may exist or heretofore have existed with respect to the
subject matter of this release. In furtherance of this intention, the
releases contained herein shall be and remain in effect as full and complete
general releases notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any such
additional or different facts.

  



  

(i) The release set forth in this Section 6 is conditioned upon
the consummation of the Merger as contemplated in the Merger Agreement and
shall become null and void and shall have no effect whatsoever, without any
action on the part of any Person, upon termination of the Merger Agreement in

7. _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

(a) _Notices_. Any notice or other communication required or
permitted to be delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be made and
given in compliance with the provisions of Section 10.1 of the Merger
Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Interpretation_. The words "include," "includes" and
"including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by
the words "without limitation." All references to the Company in this
Agreement shall be deemed to refer to the Company and each of its
subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires.

  



  

(c) _Successors_. All covenants and agreements and other
provisions set forth in this Agreement and made by or on behalf of any of the
parties hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of the successors, heirs
and permitted assigns of such party, whether or not so expressed.

  



  

(d) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. The Company, the Surviving

the Stockholder Representative are intended third party beneficiaries of this
Agreement and shall be entitled to enforce this Agreement against the Holder

(e) _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the
provisions contained herein is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect for any reason in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and
enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the
remaining provisions hereof shall not be in any way impaired or affected (so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party), it
being intended that the rights and privileges of each party shall be
enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, and any such invalidity, illegality and unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in
any other jurisdiction (so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party).

  



  

   

B-7

 



    



  

(f) _Amendment_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
this Agreement may only be amended, modified or supplemented by written
agreement of the Holder, the Stockholder Representative and Parent.

  



  

(g) _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the
State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely
in such state. The parties hereto agree that any legal proceeding by or
against any party hereto or with respect to or arising out of this Agreement
shall be brought exclusively in any state or federal court in the State of
Delaware. By execution and delivery of this Agreement, each party hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts and to the appellate courts therefrom solely for the purposes of
disputes arising under this Agreement and not as a general submission to such
jurisdiction or with respect to any other dispute, matter or claim
whatsoever. The parties hereto irrevocably consent to the service of process
out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by
the delivery of copies thereof by overnight courier to the address for such
party to which notices are deliverable hereunder. Any such service of process
shall be effective upon delivery. Nothing herein shall affect the right to
serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable Legal Requirements.
The parties hereto hereby waive any right to stay or dismiss any action or
proceeding under or in connection with this Agreement brought before the
foregoing courts on the basis of (a) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason, or that
it or any of its property is immune from the above described legal process,
(b) that such action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that
venue for the action or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement may not
be enforced in or by such courts, or (c) any other defense that would hinder
or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which any party
hereto is entitled pursuant to any final judgment of any court having
jurisdiction.

  



  

(h) _Specific Performance_. It is agreed and understood that
monetary damages would not adequately compensate an injured party hereto
for the breach of this Agreement by the Holder, that this Agreement shall be
specifically enforceable, and that any breach or threatened breach of this
Agreement shall be the proper subject of a temporary or permanent injunction
or restraining order. Further, the Holder hereby waives any claim or defense
that there is an adequate remedy at law for such breach or threatened breach.

  



  

(i) _Other Remedies_. Any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive
of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party,
and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise
of any other remedy.

  



  

   

B-8

 



    



  

(j) _Legal Counsel_. The parties hereto acknowledge that Robinson
Bradshaw and Hinson, P.A. (" _RBH_ ") has represented Parent and Porter Hedges
LLP (" _PH_ "), has represented the Company, in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and neither RBH nor PH has
undertaken to represent any other party, including the Holder, in connection
herewith or therewith.

  



  

(k) _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, may be executed in two or more counterparts and by the
different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered (including by means of electronic delivery) shall be an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

  



  

(l) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the
exhibits and schedules hereto and thereto (including the Note and the Earn-
Out Agreement), and the documents and instruments and other agreements among
the parties hereto and thereto referenced herein and therein: (i) constitute
the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings both written and
oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, (ii)
other than the third party beneficiaries referenced in Section 7(d) hereof,
are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
hereunder and (iii) shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise,
except that Parent may assign its rights and delegate its obligations
hereunder or thereunder to its affiliates as long as Parent remains
ultimately liable for all of Parent's obligations hereunder and thereunder.

  



  

(m) _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

  



  

(n) _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate automatically
and be of no further force or effect in the event the Merger Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Effective Time..

2. Payments of Principal and Interest.

  



  

(a) From the date hereof until the date when the principal under
this note has been paid in full, interest shall accrue on the unpaid
principal amount of this note at the rate of three and one half percent
(3.50%) per annum, and shall be paid quarterly in arrears in cash. Such
interest shall be computed for the actual number of days elapsed in a year
consisting of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be. Interest on the unpaid
balance shall accrue from the date hereof and quarterly payments shall be due
and payable in cash, in arrears, on the fifth (5th) calendar day following
the end of each calendar quarter until all outstanding principal, accrued but
unpaid interest and any other costs and fees are paid in full as provided for
herein. The first payment of interest shall be due on July 6, 2020. All
accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal balance of this note shall
be due and payable at the Maturity Date. In the event that any amount under
this note is not paid when due, then interest shall accrue on such
unpaid amount at a rate of ten percent (10.00%) per annum (the "Default
Rate") until such unpaid amount is paid in cash.

  



  

(b) The entire unpaid principal balance of this note and all
accrued and unpaid interest on this note, _less_ any offset pursuant to
_Section 5_, _less_ the aggregate amount of any additional Change in Control
Payments triggered as a result of such payment, shall be due and payable on
the Maturity Date.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that prior to the
Maturity Date (i) the Company effects a sale of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Company to a third party, (ii) Maker effects a sale of
the Company to a third party, (iii) Maker effects a merger or consolidation
of the Company or other transaction involving the Company, in each case which
results in at least 50% of the combined voting power of the voting securities
of the Company being owned by a third party or (iv) Maker or the
Company makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or any
proceeding shall be instituted by or against Maker or the Company seeking to
adjudicate it as bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking liquidation, winding up or
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, protection, relief or composition of
its debts under any applicable law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization, within thirty (30) days after such event, Maker shall pay to
the Payees in accordance with each Payee's Pro Rata Percentage in full the
remaining payments of principal and interest the Payees would have been
entitled to through the Maturity Date within five (5) days of such event,
_less_ any offset pursuant to _Section 5_, _less_ the aggregate amount
of any additional Change in Control Payments triggered as a result of such
payment.

  



  

(d) All payments of principal and interest due under this note
shall be paid to Payees in accordance with each Payee's Pro Rata Percentage
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts designated on
the Payment Spreadsheet.

  



  

3. No Usury Intended; Spreading. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this note, it is expressly provided that in no case or event shall the aggregate of (i) all interest on the unpaid balance of this note, accrued or paid from the date hereof and (ii) the aggregate of any other amounts accrued or paid pursuant to this note, which under applicable laws are or may be deemed to constitute interest upon the indebtedness evidenced by this note from the date hereof, ever exceed the highest lawful amount permissible under the then-applicable usury laws. In furtherance thereof, none of the terms of this note shall ever be construed to create a contract to pay, as consideration for the use, forbearance or detention of money, interest at a rate in excess of the maximum legal rate. Maker or other parties now or hereafter becoming liable for payment of the indebtedness evidenced by this note shall never be liable for interest in excess of such maximum legal amount. If, for any reason whatever, the interest paid or received on this note during its full term produces a rate which exceeds the maximum legal amount, the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Payees, shall credit against the principal of this note (or, if such indebtedness shall have been paid in full, Payees shall refund to the Maker) such portion of said interest as shall be necessary to cause the interest paid on this note to produce a rate equal to the maximum legal rate. All sums contracted for, charged or received by the Payees for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness evidenced hereby shall, to the extent required to avoid or minimize usury and to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full stated term of this note so that the interest rate does not exceed the maximum legal rate. The provisions of this Paragraph shall control all agreements, whether now or hereafter existing and whether written or oral, between Maker and the Payees.

  



  

   

C-2

 



    



  

4. Default and Remedies in Event of Default. The occurrence of any of the following events shall constitute a default under this note, whereupon the Stockholder Representative, may, at its option, by notice in writing to Maker, declare the principal of this note and accrued interest to the date of such declaration to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration by the Stockholder Representative, such amounts shall become immediately due and payable, and may otherwise exercise any or all rights, powers and remedies afforded by law:

  



  

(a) any part of the Debt, including any interest thereon, is not
paid when due, whether by lapse of time or acceleration or otherwise, unless
such default is fully cured within fifteen (15) calendar days after such due
date, or

  



  

(b) any proceeding is instituted by or against the Maker under any
present or future bankruptcy or insolvency statutory or similar law and, if
involuntary, the same are not stayed or dismissed within ninety (90) days, or
the Maker makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or a receiver,
trustee, conservator or other judicial representative is appointed for the
Maker.

  



  

All powers and remedies afforded to the Stockholder Representative by this
_Section 4_, shall, to the extent permitted by law, be deemed cumulative and
not exclusive of other remedies available to the Stockholder Representative,
whether hereunder or by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the
observance or performance of the covenants and agreements contained in this
note. No delay or omission by the Stockholder Representative to exercise any
right or power accruing upon any default hereunder shall impair such right
or power or shall be construed as a waiver or acquiescence therein. Every
power and remedy given to the Stockholder Representative by this _Section 4_
or by law may be exercised by the Stockholder Representative from time to time
and as often as the Stockholder Representative shall deem expedient.

  



  

5. Offset Rights. The parties hereto agree that if Payees shall become liable to (i) the Parent Indemnitees for indemnification under the Acquisition Agreement (as finally determined by a written settlement or a court of competent jurisdiction) or (ii) Maker for any payment under Section 1.8, Section 1.9 and Section 1.10 of the Acquisition Agreement (as finally determined by a written settlement or a court of competent jurisdiction), Maker has the right, in addition to its other rights under the Acquisition Agreement, at law or in equity, to offset any amounts owed to Maker under this note until such liability is satisfied in full.

  



  

   

C-3

 



    



  

6. Subordination.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
obligations of Maker in respect of the payments due under this note and any
other amounts due under this note (the " _Subordinated Debt_ ") shall be and
are fully subordinate and junior in right and time of payment to any and all
Senior Debt (as hereinafter defined). No payments or prepayments under this
note (a " _Payment_ "), shall be made except in compliance with the
provisions of this _Section 6_. If any Payment is made to the Payees
in violation of this provision, then each Payee shall hold the portion of
such Payment paid to it in trust for Senior Lender (as hereinafter defined)
and shall, after written notice to the Payees, immediately deliver such
Payment paid to it in the form received to such Senior Lender. If there is
more than one Senior Lender at the time such payments from Payees are due to
Senior Lender hereunder, the Payees shall severally make such Payments based
on a written certification of priority delivered to the Payees among the
entities constituting Senior Lender provided by Maker. If the Payees are
required pursuant to the foregoing provisions to deliver any such Payment to
Senior Lender, then to the extent Maker received credit for such Payment
against amounts due under this note, such credit shall be immediately
reversed upon the delivery of such Payment to Senior Lender and such amounts
shall once again be due and payable hereunder and evidenced hereby. Seller
Representative and the Payees hereby acknowledge and agree that the
subordination of this note specifically includes, but is not limited to the
Wells Fargo Credit Facility (as hereinafter defined).

  



  

(b) The Payees shall be entitled to be paid the amounts due under
this note in conformity with the specific payment terms of this note set
forth in _Section 2_, as long as no event of default exists under the
agreements executed in connection with the Senior Debt and the making of such
Payment would not cause, directly or indirectly, a default or event of default
to occur under the terms of the agreements executed in connection with the
Senior Debt.

  



  

(c) If there should occur any receivership, insolvency, assignment
for the benefit of creditors, bankruptcy, reorganization or arrangement with
creditors (whether or not pursuant to bankruptcy or other insolvency laws); a
default under the terms of the documents executed in connection with any
Senior Debt; sale of all or substantially all of the assets, dissolution,
liquidation or any other marshalling of the assets and liabilities of Maker,
or if this note shall be declared due and payable upon the occurrence of an
event of default under this note, then (i) no amount shall be paid by Maker
in respect of the Debt, unless and until the principal of and interest on the
Senior Debt then outstanding shall be indefeasibly paid in full, and (ii) no
claim or proof of claim shall be filed by the Stockholder Representative or
the Payees that shall assert any right to receive any payments in respect of
the principal of and interest on this note, unless and until the principal of
and interest on the Senior Debt then outstanding shall be indefeasibly paid
in full; provided that the Stockholder Representative or the Payees may file a
proof of claim in a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving Maker, as
long as such filing indicates Payees' subordination hereunder and directs
the payment of any amounts payable under such claim to Senior Lender until
the Senior Debt is indefeasibly paid in full.

  



  

   

C-4

 



    



  

(d) Subject to the rights of Senior Lender under this _Section 6_
to receive cash, securities or other properties otherwise payable or
deliverable to the Payees, nothing contained in this _Section 6_ shall
impair, as between Maker and the Stockholder Representative or the Payees,
the obligation of Maker, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, to pay to
the Payees the principal hereof and interest thereon as and when the same
became due and payable, or shall prevent the Stockholder Representative
upon an event of default hereunder, from exercising all right, powers and
remedies otherwise provided herein or by applicable law.

  



  

(e) By its acceptance of this note, the Stockholder Representative
agrees to execute and deliver such documents as may be reasonably requested
from time to time by Maker or Senior Lender in order to implement or clarify
the provisions of this _Section 6_. In addition, the Stockholder
Representative and Maker further agree that Senior Lender is a third party
beneficiary to the provisions of _Section 6_ of this note and may enforce
the terms thereof against the Stockholder Representative, the Payees,
or Maker.

  



  

(f) For purposes of this note, the following capitalized terms are
defined as follows:

  



  

i. " _Senior Debt_ " means the aggregate amount of any and all (A)

EARN-OUT AGREEMENT

  



  

BY AND AMONG

  



  

COMFORT SYSTEMS USA, INC.

  



  

and

  



  

THE STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE NAMED HEREIN

  



  

DATED AS OF [_____ __], 2020

  



     

   

D-1

 



    



  

 _EARN-OUT AGREEMENT_

  



  

This Earn-Out Agreement (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of [______ __],
2020, is by and between Comfort Systems USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Purchaser_ "), and Element Partners II, L.P., solely in its capacity as the
Stockholder Representative (as defined in the Merger Agreement (as defined
below) (and, if applicable, any successor or assign of the
Stockholder Representative). Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative are
sometimes individually referred to herein as a " _Party_ " and collectively
as the " _Parties_."

  



  

RECITALS

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company Stockholders (each individually a " _Seller_ " and,
collectively, the " _Sellers_ ") own all of the issued and outstanding
capital stock (of all classes) (the " _Shares_ ") of TAS Energy Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Purchaser,
the Company, OSC Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Merger Sub_
"), and the Stockholder Representative dated as of March 9, 2020 (the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), it is a condition to closing that the Parties execute
and deliver this Agreement to each other;

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and
into the Company and each outstanding share of Company Capital Stock at the
Effective Time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive a
portion of the Merger Consideration upon the terms and conditions set forth
therein;

  



  

WHEREAS, capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined herein shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Parties intend to provide for the payment of additional Merger
Consideration to Sellers based on the future financial performance of the
Company, as a division of the Purchaser, following the Closing (" _Earn
-Out_").

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the respective
representations, warranties and covenants contained herein and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

  



  

 _AGREEMENT_

  



  

SECTION 1  _Earn-Out_.

  



  

(a) The Earn-Out for each applicable period shall be determined as
follows:

     



  

(i) for the period from the Closing Date until June 30, 2021, the
Earn-Out shall be an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the EBITDA
(as defined below) for such period that exceeds Twenty Million Dollars and No
Cents ($20,000,000.00); and

  



  

(ii) for the period from July 1, 2021 until June 30, 2022, the
Earn-Out shall be an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the EBITDA during
such period that exceeds Twenty Million Dollars and No Cents ($20,000,000.00).

  



  

   

D-2

 



    



  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _EBITDA_ " means (without
duplication), with respect to any applicable period, the net income of the
Company and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, _plus_ , the amount of
interest expense (net of any interest income) deducted in determining net
income, _plus_ , the amount of Taxes related to the earnings or income of
the Company and its subsidiaries (whether accrued or paid in cash or
deferred) deducted in determining net income, _plus_ , the amount of
depreciation and amortization related to the Company and its subsidiaries
deducted in determining net income; and EBITDA shall not include (i) any
overhead charges or any management fees paid to Purchaser or any Affiliate of
Purchaser (other than expenses paid for goods and services procured on an
arms-length basis in the ordinary course of business such as insurance, fuel,
employee benefits, etc.), (ii) goodwill and other intangibles amortization,
that are a result of Purchaser's acquisition of the Company, (iii) any gain,
loss, income or expense resulting from any changes in Purchaser's
accounting methods, principles or practices or a material change in GAAP, and
(iv) any "extraordinary items" of gain or loss as that term is defined in
GAAP. For purposes of calculating the Earn-Out, EBITDA will be calculated in
accordance with GAAP. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Earn-Out,
EBITDA for any applicable period shall be: (i) reduced by any amounts accrued
for payment to Stockholder Representative by Purchaser for the WIP Adjustment
for the applicable period of computation, or (ii) increased by any amounts
accrued for payment to Purchaser by Stockholder Representative for the WIP
Adjustment for the applicable period of computation. It is the express
intention of the Parties that EBITDA shall be calculated in a manner
to fairly reflect the true economic return of the Company as an incremental
and separate part of Purchaser and calculated in a manner consistent with the
Company's historical practices as set forth on _Exhibit A_. The Parties shall
use the same financial information and accruals for calculation of the Earn-
Out hereunder as they use for calculation of the WIP Adjustment under the
Merger Agreement.

  



  

(c) Purchaser's obligation to pay any Earn-Out payment in
accordance with this Agreement is an independent obligation and is not
otherwise conditioned or contingent upon the satisfaction of any conditions
precedent to any preceding or subsequent Earn-Out. For the avoidance of doubt
and by way of example, if the condition precedent to the payment of the Earn-
Out for the period ended June 30, 2021 is not satisfied, but the condition
precedent to the payment of the Earn-Out for the period ended June 30, 2022 is
satisfied, then Purchaser would be obligated to pay such Earn-Out for the
period ended June 30, 2022, and not the Earn-Out for the period ended June
30, 2021.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the combined
total of all Earn-Out payments made pursuant to this _Section 1_, shall not
exceed Twenty-Five Million Dollars and No Cents ($25,000,000.00).

  



  

(e) Purchaser acknowledges that the possibility of the Company
receiving the Earn-Out payments comprises a material inducement for the
Company and the Sellers to enter into the Merger Agreement and this
Agreement. During the period of time from the Closing Date through June 30,
2022: (i) the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be operated
as a separate business unit of the Purchaser, (ii) the Purchaser, and after
the Closing, the Company and the Sellers who are Continuing Employees,
shall not take, or fail to take, any action for the primary purpose or with
the primary intent of augmenting, avoiding or reducing the Earn-Out payments,
and (iii) the Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Stockholder Representative, make any material change in the accounting
principles in place at the Company at the Closing Date that negatively effects
the calculation of EBITDA other than any change required to be implemented by
the Financial Accounting Standards Board.

  



  

   

D-3

 



    



  

(f) In the event that prior to June 30, 2022 (i) the Company
effects a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to a
third party, (ii) the Purchaser effects a sale of the Company to a third
party, (iii) the Purchaser effects a merger or consolidation of the Company
or other transaction involving the Company, in each case which results in at
least 50% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the
Company being owned by a third party or (iv) the Purchaser or the Company
makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or any proceeding
shall be instituted by or against the Purchaser or the Company seeking to
adjudicate it as bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking liquidation, winding up or
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, protection, relief or composition of
its debts under any applicable Law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization, within thirty (30) days after such event, the Purchaser shall
pay to the Sellers in full the remaining Earn-Out payments the Sellers would
have been entitled to through June 30, 2022 within ten (10) days of such
event.

  



  

SECTION 2  _Payment of Earn-Out_. Within ten (10) days after the Earn-Out for
a period is finally determined pursuant to  _Section 3_ herein, Purchaser
will pay the Earn-Out for such period, if any, less the aggregate amount of
any additional Change in Control Payments triggered as a result of the
payment of such Earn-Out, to the Sellers in accordance with each Seller's Pro
Rata Percentage by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
accounts designated on the Payment Spreadsheet. If any Earn-Out is not paid
by Purchaser to the Sellers when due hereunder, such amount shall accrue
interest from and including the date such payment was due through the date
such payment has been made at a rate per annum equal to 5%. Such interest
shall be calculated daily on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual
number of days elapsed, without compounding. Subject to the limitations and
other provisions set forth in Article VI of the Merger Agreement, the
Purchaser shall have the right to set-off any indemnifiable Losses for which
Sellers are responsible against any Earn-Out otherwise due and payable
hereunder.

  



  

SECTION 3  _Procedures to Determine Earn-Out_.

  



  

(a) On or before sixty (60) days following the end of each period
described in _Section 1(a)_, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Stockholder
Representative a proposed written calculation of the Earn-Out earned, if any,
as certified in writing by the Purchaser and delivered in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 6_. Purchaser shall provide, and cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to provide, the Stockholder Representative and
his representatives with access to the personnel, financial information,
books and records of the Company and its subsidiaries, and shall otherwise
cooperate with and reasonably assist the Stockholder Representative in taking
such acts as may be necessary to allow Stockholder Representative to prepare
all deliverables required or contemplated by this Agreement, the Note and the
Merger Agreement and make all necessary calculations in accordance with this
Agreement, the Note and the Merger Agreement .

  



  

   

D-4

 



    



  

(b) If Stockholder Representative disputes the Purchaser's
calculation of the Earn-Out, Stockholder Representative shall so
notify Purchaser within thirty (30) days after receipt of Purchaser's written
calculation referred to in _Section 2_, and submit to the Purchaser the
Stockholder Representative's proposed calculation of the Earn-Out in writing
certified by the Stockholder Representative and delivered in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 6_. If Stockholder Representative does not
dispute the Purchaser's calculation of the Earn-Out and provide Purchaser with
Stockholder Representative's calculation within such 30-day period, the
Purchaser's calculation of the Earn-Out shall be final and binding on the
Parties. If Stockholder Representative disputes Purchaser's calculation and
provides Purchaser with Stockholder Representative's calculation within such
30-day period, Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser shall then make a
good faith effort to meet and resolve the difference between Stockholder
Representative's calculation and the Purchaser's calculation. If
within thirty (30) days after receipt of Stockholder Representative's
calculation, Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser have been unable to
reach agreement, Stockholder Representative and the Purchaser within fifteen
(15) days thereafter shall jointly select an independent certified public
accounting firm, or if they are unable to do so, within twenty (20) days
thereafter either Stockholder Representative or the Purchaser shall request
the American Arbitration Association to designate a firm of
independent certified public accountants having no past or current
affiliation with Stockholder Representative, Stockholder
Representative's Affiliates, the Sellers, or the Sellers' Affiliates (such
selected accounting firm being referred to herein as the " _Arbitrator_
"), to determine whether Stockholder Representative's or the Purchaser's
calculation is most accurate. The Arbitrator shall certify this decision in
writing to the Parties, and shall have no choice but to select either the
Stockholder Representative's calculation in its entirety or the Purchaser's
calculation in its entirety (there shall be no award of pre-judgment
interest). The Arbitrator's determination shall be final and binding on the
Parties. The fees, costs, and expenses of the Arbitrator, including any
attorneys' or experts' fees related thereto, shall be borne by the non-
prevailing Party.

  



  

SECTION 4  _Modification and Waiver of Breach_. No waiver or
modification of this Agreement shall be binding unless it is in writing signed
by the Purchaser and Stockholder Representative. No waiver of a breach hereof
shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of a future breach, whether of a
similar or dissimilar nature.

  



  

SECTION 5  _Assignment_. The rights and obligations of Purchaser under
this Agreement may, without the consent of the Stockholder Representative, be
assigned by Purchaser, in its sole and unfettered discretion, (a) to any
subsidiary or Affiliate of Purchaser, provided that in the event of any such
assignment Purchaser must guarantee all obligations hereunder, (b) to any
transferee, whether by purchase, merger or otherwise, that directly or
indirectly acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of
Purchaser, provided that in the event of any such assignment Purchaser must
guarantee all obligations hereunder, or (c) as collateral to any lender or
provider of financing to the Purchaser or any subsidiary or affiliate of the
Purchaser. Except as expressly provided in the preceding sentence, no Party
may directly or indirectly assign any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Parties.

SECTION 8  _Gender; "Including" is Not Limiting; Descriptive Headings_. The
masculine and neuter genders used in this Agreement each includes the
masculine, feminine and neuter genders, and the singular number includes the
plural, each where appropriate, and vice versa. Wherever the term "including"
or a similar term is used in this Agreement, it shall be read as if it were
written "including by way of example only and without in any way limiting the
generality of the clause or concept referred to." The descriptive headings
are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be
part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



     

SECTION 9  _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each Party, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 10  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all
of which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. Facsimile
or scanned and emailed ( _i.e_., Portable Document Format (pdf)) transmission
of any signed original document or retransmission of any signed facsimile or
scanned and emailed (pdf) transmission shall constitute enforceable original
documents and will be deemed the same as delivery of an original. At the
request of any Party, the Parties will confirm facsimile or scanned and
emailed transmission by signing a duplicate original document.

  



  

SECTION 11  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and all other documents dated

other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
Parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  



  

SECTION 12  _Reformation and Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement
shall be separable and a determination that any provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal, unenforceable or void shall not affect the validity,
legality or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. In case
any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal, unenforceable or
void, it shall, to the extent possible, be modified and/or interpreted in
such manner as to be valid, legal and enforceable, but so as to most nearly
retain the intent of the Parties, and if such modification is not possible,
such provision shall be severed from this Agreement, and in either case, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. Any court of
competent jurisdiction is authorized and directed by the Parties to enforce
any otherwise invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision in part, to modify
it, to enforce it only to a degree and not fully, or otherwise to enforce
that provision only in a manner and to an extent, or for a shorter period of
time, that renders the provision valid or enforceable. The intent of the
Parties is that this Agreement be enforceable and enforced to the
maximum extent possible after excising (or deeming excised) all invalid or
unenforceable provisions, whether or not the remaining provisions are
grammatically correct.

for the Southern District of Texas in Houston, and/or any state district court
of the State of Texas located in Harris County, Texas in any action, suit or
proceeding brought by or against such Party in connection with, arising from
or relating to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby and any
document contemplated herein or otherwise relating hereto, and each Party
hereby waives and further agrees not to assert as a defense in any such suit,
action or proceeding any claim that such Party is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of any such courts, that the venue of the suit, action or
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that this Agreement or the
subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such courts. THE PARTIES
HEREBY WAIVE IRREVOCABLY ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO DEMAND A TRIAL BY JURY IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR ANY
DOCUMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR OTHERWISE RELATED HERETO.

EXHIBIT E 
 SAMPLE WIP ADJUSTMENT CALCULATION

  



  

The WIP Adjustment shall be calculated on a contract-by-contract basis using
the following formula:

  



     WIP Adjustment  | =  | Final Revenue Earned  | X  | (  | _Cost
to Date @ Closing Date_ 
  Final Total Costs  | )  | -  | Revenue Earned @ Closing Date  | -  |
Any loss that would have been accrued  as of Closing Date in accordance with
GAAP 
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
  



  

For example, if at the Closing the Company has earned $800,000 of revenue and
accrued $600,000 of expenses with respect to a particular project and upon
commencement of the project's warranty period, total revenue is $1,000,000
and total costs are $650,000, the WIP Adjustment with respect to that project
would be positive $123,077, reflecting the additional margin that would have
been reflected as of the Closing. Also, for example, if at the Closing, the
Company has recognized $800,000 of revenue and incurred $600,000 of expenses
with respect to a particular project, and upon commencement of the project's
warranty period, total revenue earned is $1,000,000 and total expenses are
$1,100,000, the WIP Adjustment with respect to that project would be negative
$300,000, composed of $200,000 in margin that had been incorrectly recognized
as of the Closing plus $54,546 representing the amount of the loss that had
been spent before the Closing, plus $45,454 representing the amount of
expected loss that would have been accrued pursuant to GAAP as of the Closing
for the project.

 _INSTRUCTIONS_

  



  

 _1._ _ Delivery of Letter of Transmittal and Certificate(s)._
This Letter of Transmittal filled in and signed, must be used in connection
with the delivery and surrender of the Certificate(s) and Warrant(s). A Letter
of Transmittal and the Certificate(s) and Warrant(s) must be received by
Parent, in satisfactory form, in order to make an effective surrender.
Delivery of the Certificate(s) and Warrant(s) and other documents shall be
effected, and the risk of loss and title to the Certificate(s) and Warrant(s)
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificate(s) and Warrant(s) to
Parent. The method of delivery of the Certificate(s) and Warrant(s) and other
documents is at the election and risk of the stockholder. If such delivery is
by mail, registered mail with return receipt requested, properly insured, is
recommended. Surrender may be made by mail, by hand or by overnight courier to
Parent at the address shown above. Upon surrender of the Certificate(s) and
Warrant(s), any Shares issued subsequent to such surrender and prior to the
closing of the Merger shall be deemed to be surrendered for payment.

  



  

2. _Terms of Conversion of the Shares._ Each Share and Warrant (as shown in the box on the first page of this Letter of Transmittal) was converted at the Effective Time of the Merger into the right to receive cash merger consideration, without interest, and subject to applicable withholding, as set forth in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

 _3._ _ Guarantee of Signature_. The Certificate(s) need not be
endorsed and stock powers and signature guarantees are unnecessary unless (a)
the Certificate(s) is(are) registered in a name other than that of the
person surrendering the Certificate(s) or (b) such registered holder
completes the Special Payment/Delivery Instructions on the first page of this
Letter of Transmittal or requests payment to a name other than the registered
holder. In the case of (a) above, any such Certificate(s) must be duly
endorsed or accompanied by a properly executed stock power with the signature
on the endorsement or stock power and on the Letter of Transmittal guaranteed
by a participant in the Security Transfer Agents Medallion Program, the New
York Stock Exchange Medallion Signature Guarantee Program or the Stock
Exchange Medallion Program (each, an "Eligible Institution"). In the case of
(b) above, only the signature on the Letter of Transmittal should be
similarly guaranteed.

  



  

 _4._ _ Signatures on Letter of Transmittal and Endorsements._ If
this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the
Shares and Warrants surrendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond with
the name(s) as written on the face of the Certificate(s) without alteration,
enlargement or any change whatsoever. If any of the Shares and Warrants
surrendered hereby are registered in different names on several Certificates,
it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many separate Letters of
Transmittal as there are different registrations of Certificates.

  



  

If any of the Shares and Warrants surrendered hereby are held of record by
two or more joint owners, all such owners must sign this Letter of
Transmittal. If this Letter of Transmittal or any Certificate or stock power
or Warrant is signed by a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian,
attorney-in-fact, officer of a corporation or other person acting in a
fiduciary or representative capacity, such person should so indicate when
signing, and proper evidence satisfactory to Parent of the authority of such
person so to act must be submitted.

  



  

If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the
Shares and Warrants listed and surrendered hereby, no endorsements of
Certificates or separate stock powers are required unless payment is to be
issued in the name of a person other than the registered holder(s).
Signatures on any such Certificates or stock powers must be guaranteed by an
Eligible Institution.

  



  

If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by a person other than the registered
holder(s) of the Shares and Warrants evidenced by Certificates listed and
surrendered hereby, the Certificates must be endorsed or accompanied by
appropriate stock powers, in either case signed exactly as the name(s) of the
registered holder(s) appear(s) on the Certificates. Signature(s) on any
such Certificates or stock powers must be guaranteed by an Eligible
Institution.

  



  

 _5._ _ Stock Transfer Taxes._ The registered holder(s) will bear
liability for any stock transfer taxes applicable to the delivery of checks
in payment for surrendered Shares and Warrants; provided, however, that if any
such check is to be issued to any person(s) other than the registered
holder(s) of the surrendered Shares and Warrants, it shall be a condition of
the issuance and delivery of such check that the amount of any stock transfer
taxes (whether imposed on the registered holder(s) or such person(s)) payable
on account of the transfer (or transfers) of the surrendered Shares
and Warrants shall be delivered to Parent or satisfactory evidence of the
payment of such taxes or nonapplicability thereof shall be submitted to
Parent before such check will be issued.

  



  

   

F-8

 



    



  

 _6._ _ Validity of Surrender, Irregularities._ All questions as
to validity, form and eligibility of any surrender of Shares and Warrants
hereby will be determined by Parent (which may delegate power in whole or in
part to Parent), and such determination shall be final and binding. Parent
reserves the right to waive any irregularities or defects in the surrender of
any Shares, and its interpretations of the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement and of this Letter of Transmittal (including these instructions)
with respect to such irregularities or defects shall be final and binding. A
surrender will not be deemed to have been made until all irregularities have
been cured or waived.

  



  

 _7._ _ Special Payment and Delivery Instructions. _Indicate the
name and address to which payment for the Shares and Warrants is to be sent
if different from the name and/or address of the person(s) signing this Letter
of Transmittal.

  



  

 _8._ _ Requests for Information or Additional Copies.
_Information and additional copies of this Letter of Transmittal may be
obtained from Parent by writing to the address on the front of this Letter of
Transmittal.

  



  

 _9._ _ Inadequate Space. _ If the space provided on this Letter
of Transmittal is inadequate, the Share certificate numbers and number of
Shares and Warrants should be listed on a separate signed schedule affixed
hereto.

  



  

 _10._ _ Letter of Transmittal Required; Surrender of
Certificate(s); Lost Certificate(s). _You will not receive any cash for your
Shares and Warrants unless and until you deliver this Letter of Transmittal
duly completed and signed, to Parent, together with the Certificate(s)
representing such Shares and Warrants (except for any portion of Shares and
Warrants that are issued subsequent to your submission of this Letter of
Transmittal and the Certificate(s) and Warrant(s)), which Certificate(s) for
such Shares shall be retained by Parent) and any required accompanying
evidences of authority in form satisfactory to Parent. If the Certificate(s)
has (have) been lost or destroyed, such fact should be indicated on the
face of this Letter of Transmittal. In such event, Parent will forward
additional documentation and instructions necessary to be completed in order
to effectively surrender the Shares and Warrants represented by such lost or
destroyed Certificate(s) (including instructions relating to payment by
holder of such lost or destroyed Certificate of an indemnity/surety bond fee
equal to 2.25% of the cash value of the Shares and Warrants represented by
such Certificate with a minimum of $150.00. No interest will be paid on
amounts due for the Shares and Warrants.

  



  

 _11._ _ Form W-9. _Each stockholder surrendering Shares and
Warrants for payment is required to provide Parent with a correct Taxpayer
Identification Number ("TIN") and certain other information on an appropriate
IRS Form W-9, or an appropriate IRS Form W-8.

THIRD AMENDMENT TO THE COMMERCIAL LEASE

  



  

This Third Amendment to the Commercial Lease (this " _Amendment_ ") is made
as of the [___] day of [_______], 2020 (the " _Effective Date_ ") by and
between IFP-II, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (" _Landlord_ "), and
TAS ENERGY INC., a Delaware corporation (" _Tenant_ "). Reference is made
herein to that certain Commercial Lease Agreement, dated September 21, 2018,
by and between Landlord and Tenant (the " _Original Lease Agreement_ " and,
together with the First Amendment to the Commercial Lease, dated September
21, 2018 (the " _First Amendment_ "), the Second Amendment to the Commercial
Lease, dated April 1, 2019 (the " _Second Amendment_ ") and this
Amendment, the " _Lease_ ") for the property located at 12218 Robin
Boulevard, Houston, Texas 77045 (the " _Property_ "). Capitalized terms used
herein but not defined shall have the meaning given to them in the Original
Lease Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment and the Second Amendment.

  



  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt, adequacy and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Lease is hereby amended and
the parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:

  



  

1. Option Term. Section 1.04 of the Original Lease Agreement shall be struck and replaced with the following:

  



  

Provided Tenant is not in default, the Tenant is granted the option to extend
the Term of this Lease for three (3) additional five (5) year periods, the
first of which will commence at the end of the original Lease Term as set
forth in §1.01 (the " _First Renewal Period_ "). The second renewal period
will commence at the end of the First Renewal Period (the " _Second Renewal
Period_ "). The third renewal period will commence at the end of the Second
Renewal Period (the " _Third Renewal Period_ "). Tenant must give notice to
the Landlord no more than two (2) years and no less than three hundred sixty
(360) days prior to the end of the initial Lease Term or prior to the end of
the First Renewal Period or Second Renewal Period, as applicable, stating
Tenant's intention to exercise its renewal option. Within a reasonable time
after Tenant's written notice setting forth its intention to extend the Lease
Term, Landlord and Tenant shall execute an amendment to the Lease evidencing
the extension of the Lease for the renewal period. Base Rent shall increase
annually during the First Renewal Period, Second Renewal Period or Third
Renewal Period, as applicable, by the percentage increase, if any, in the CPI
each year during the period (the " _Renewal Rate_ ").

  



  

2. Definition of CPI. The following term shall be defined as set out below:

  



  

" _CPI_ " means the monthly indexes of the National Consumer Price Index for
All Urban Consumers (1982-84 equals 100) issued from time to time by the
United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (the "Bureau")
or any successor measure hereafter employed by the Bureau in lieu of such
price index that measures the cost of living in the United States;
provided, however, that if no such successor measure is published, then the
term "CPI" shall mean the most nearly comparable index reflecting changes in
costs of housing (including rental housing), energy and services published by
any Governmental Authority, as appropriately adjusted; and provided, further,
that if, after the date hereof, the CPI is converted to a different
standard reference base or a substantial change is made in the number or
character of "market basket" items contained therein, then for purposes of
this Lease the CPI shall be adjusted (with the use of such conversion factor,
formula or table as is published by the Bureau or, if no such publication is
made by the Bureau, by any nationally recognized publisher of similar
statistical information) to the figure that would have resulted if not for
such conversion or change.

  



  

   

G-1

 



    



  

3. Assignment. Section 14.01 shall be amended to insert the following at the end of the section:

  



  

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Tenant may assign this
Lease, or any right or interest in this Lease or in the Leased Premises or
the Improvements on the Leased Premises, to its successor-in-interest as a
result of a change in control transaction or to an entity controlled by or
under common control with Tenant.

  



  

Tenant and Landlord agree that this Amendment shall satisfy any requirements
for prior written notice related to such an assignment.

  



  

4. Entire Agreement. This Amendment, together with the Original Lease Agreement, the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, represent the entire agreement between the parties hereto. Landlord and Tenant agree that there are no collateral or oral agreements or understandings between them with respect to the Property. This Amendment supersedes all prior negotiations, agreements, letters or other statements with respect to the Property.

  



  

5. No Further Modifications. Except as expressly amended and modified hereby or as amended and modified in the First Amendment and Second Amendment, the Original Lease Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect, the parties hereto hereby ratifying and confirming the same. To the extent of any inconsistency between the Original Lease Agreement or a previous amendment and this Amendment, the terms of this Amendment shall control.

  



  

6. Counterpart Execution. This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which when attached together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
