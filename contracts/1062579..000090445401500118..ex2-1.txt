inconsistent with such allocations on any Tax Return or otherwise. Each of
Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate with the other in preparing IRS Form 8594
or any equivalent statements for filing within a reasonable period before its

the accounts receivable of the Business as of the Closing Date calculated in
accordance with Section 2.04(e) (the "Closing Accounts Receivable"), and (y) the
initial draft of a statement of the deferred revenue liability of the Business
as of the Closing Date calculated in accordance with Section 2.04(e) (the
"Closing Deferred Revenue Liability"), and (z) the initial draft of a statement
of setting forth the current liabilities described on Section 2.04(e)(C) of the
Disclosure Schedule of the Business as of the Closing Date calculated in
accordance with Section 2.04(e) (the "Closing Specified Liabilities"), together
with a report of its independent public accounting firm indicating the results
of the procedures described in Section 2.04(e) and Section 2.04(e)(A), Section
2.04(e)(B) and Section 2.04(e)(C) of the Disclosure Schedule.

          (b) (i) If the amount of Closing Accounts Receivable is less than
$37,900,000, Seller shall, within 10 Business Days after the statement of
Closing Accounts Receivable becomes final and binding on the parties pursuant to
Sections 2.04(c) and (d) below, make payment by wire transfer in immediately
available funds of the amount of such deficiency together with a sum equivalent
to interest thereon at a rate equal to the rate of interest from time to time
announced publicly by Citibank N.A. as its LIBOR rate, calculated on the basis
of the actual number of days elapsed divided by 360, from the Closing Date to
and including the date of payment.

          (ii) If the amount of Closing Deferred Revenue Liability exceeds
     $45,500,000, Seller shall, within 10 Business Days after the statement of
     Closing Deferred Revenue Liability becomes final and binding on the parties
     pursuant to Sections 2.04(c) and (d) below, make payment by wire transfer
     in immediately available funds of the amount of such excess together with a
     sum equivalent to interest thereon at a rate equal to the rate of interest
     from time to time announced publicly by Citibank N.A. as its LIBOR rate,
     calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed divided by
     360, from the Closing Date to and including the date of payment.

          (iii) If the amount of Closing Specified Liabilities exceeds
     $14,500,000, Seller shall, within 10 Business Days after the statement of
     Closing Specified Liabilities becomes final and binding on the parties
     pursuant to Sections 2.04(c) and (d) below, make payment by wire transfer
     in immediately available funds of the amount of such excess together with a
     sum equivalent to interest thereon at a rate equal to the rate of interest
     from time to time announced publicly by Citibank N.A. as its LIBOR rate,
     calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed divided by
     360, from the Closing Date to and including the date of payment.

                                       16
<PAGE>

          (iv) The parties agree that amounts paid pursuant to Sections
     2.04(b)(i), (ii) and (iii) shall be allocated in a manner that is
     consistent with the allocation of the Purchase Price as set forth in
     Section 2.03(b).

          (c) If Purchaser disagrees with an adjustment set forth in Seller's
initial statement of Closing Accounts Receivable, Closing Deferred Revenue
Liability or Closing Specified Liabilities under this Section 2.04, Purchaser
shall notify Seller of such disagreement within 45 days after Seller has
delivered such statement to Purchaser, which notice of Purchaser shall set forth
any such disagreement in reasonable detail. Within such 45-day period, Purchaser
shall have reasonable access to any documents, schedules or workpapers used in
the preparation of the relevant initial statement. Purchaser and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disagreement, and any resolution
agreed to in writing by Purchaser and Seller shall be final and binding upon the
parties. In the event that Purchaser fails to provide notice of disagreement
with respect to one or more of Seller's initial statements within the 45-day
period as set forth above, the adjustment set forth in such statement or
statements shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto.

          (d) If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement as
contemplated by Section 2.04(c) within 45 days after delivery of written notice
of such disagreement as provided in Section 2.04(c), then Purchaser and Seller
shall jointly select a partner at Arthur Andersen LLP, KPMG LLP or
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to resolve such disagreement; provided that, if such
individual is not available or is not willing to act, then one of Arthur
Andersen LLP, KPMG LLP or PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall be chosen by lot to
designate one of its partners to resolve such disagreement (the person so
selected shall be referred to herein as the "Accounting Arbitrator"). The scope
of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Arbitrator shall be limited to
the extent to which, if any, adjustments are required in order that the
calculations set forth in Seller's initial statement of Closing Accounts
Receivable, Seller's initial statement of Closing Deferred Revenue Liability or
Seller's initial statement of Closing Specified Liabilities, as the case may be,
were prepared in accordance with Section 2.04(e), and whether there were
mathematical errors in such statement, and the Accounting Arbitrator is not to
make or be asked to make any other determination. Purchaser and Seller shall use
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Arbitrator to deliver to the parties,
as promptly as practicable, a written report setting forth the resolution of any
such disagreement determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Such report shall be final and binding upon the parties. Judgment may be entered
upon the determination of the Accounting Arbitrator in any court having
jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be enforced.
The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne
one-half by Purchaser and one-half by Seller; provided that, if the Accounting
Arbitrator determines that one party's position is completely correct, then such
party shall pay none of the fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting
Arbitrator and the other party shall pay all such fees, costs and expenses.

          (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, and for all
purposes of this Section 2.04, (i) Closing Accounts Receivable shall be
calculated in accordance with the rules of calculation specified in Section
2.04(e)(A) of the Disclosure Schedule, including the rules therein relating to
receivables and the collection thereof, in compliance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"), (ii) Closing Deferred
Revenue

specified in Section 2.04(e)(B) of the Disclosure Schedule in compliance with
U.S. GAAP and (iii) Closing Specified Liabilities shall be calculated in
accordance with the rules of calculation specified in Section 2.04(e)(C) of the
Disclosure Schedule in compliance with U.S. GAAP.

     executed by Seller and/or the Selling Subsidiary that is a party thereto;

          (ii) certified copies of the resolutions of Seller's and any Selling
     Subsidiary's respective Board of Directors authorizing the execution,
     delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements;

     accordance with Section 2.04);

          (iv) any and all documents required pursuant to Section 5.10 or
     Section 5.12; and

          (v) such other evidence as Purchaser or Purchaser's counsel may
     reasonably request to demonstrate the satisfaction of conditions and
     compliance with covenants on the part of Seller.

          SECTION 2.07. Closing Deliveries by Purchaser. At the Closing,
Purchaser shall deliver to Seller:

          (i) the Purchase Price (prior to being adjusted in accordance with
     Section 2.04), by wire transfer in immediately available funds, to an
     account or accounts designated at least two Business Days prior to the
     Closing Date by Seller in a written notice to Purchaser;

          (ii) an executed counterpart of each of the Ancillary Agreements; and

          (iii) any documents required pursuant to Section 5.10 or 5.12.

                                       18

the Selling Subsidiaries shall promptly deliver to Purchaser any cash or other
property received directly or indirectly by it with respect to such receivables
and such other related items, including any amounts payable as interest.
Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Seller any receivables and other related
items that are not included in the Assets received directly or indirectly by it,
including any amounts payable as interest.

                                  ARTICLE III

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

          Except as otherwise set forth in the Disclosure Schedule and except
for matters relating to Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities, Seller
represents and warrants to Purchaser as of the date hereof and as of the Closing
Date as though made on the Closing Date (except to the extent such
representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date only and
except to the extent any such representation or warranty may be untrue or
incorrect as a result of (A) any action or inaction by Seller that is required
by this Agreement or otherwise consented to in writing by Purchaser or (B) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the announcement thereof), as
follows:

          SECTION 3.01. Incorporation and Authority of Seller and the Selling
Subsidiaries. (a) Seller is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has
all necessary corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, to carry out its respective obligations hereunder and
thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by
Seller, the performance by Seller of its obligations hereunder and thereunder
and the consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part
of Seller. This Agreement has been, and upon execution the Ancillary Agreements
will be, duly executed and delivered by Seller, and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Purchaser) this Agreement constitutes, and upon
execution the Ancillary Agreements will constitute, legal, valid and binding
obligations of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with their
terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization and Laws affecting generally the enforcement of the
rights of contracting parties and subject to a court's discretionary authority
with respect to the granting of a decree ordering specific performance or other
equitable remedies, and further subject to the Currency Act (Canada) precluding
a court in Canada from awarding a judgement for an amount expressed in a
currency other than Canadian dollars.

          (b) Each of the Selling Subsidiaries is an entity duly formed, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
formation and has all necessary power and authority to enter into the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party, to carry out its obligations hereunder and
thereunder, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and
to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct the
Business

                                       19
<page>

as presently conducted. The execution and delivery by each Selling Subsidiary of
the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, the performance by each Selling
Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by
each Selling Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
will be, on or prior to the Closing Date, duly authorized by all requisite
corporate action on the part of the Selling Subsidiary. Each Ancillary Agreement
to which a Selling Subsidiary is a party will be duly executed and delivered by
such Selling Subsidiary, and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
by Purchaser) each such agreement will constitute legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Selling Subsidiary, enforceable against such Selling
Subsidiary in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and Laws affecting
generally the enforcement of the rights of contracting parties.

          (c) Other than the Selling Subsidiaries, no Affiliate of Seller is
presently or has in the past been engaged in the operation or conduct of the
Business.

          SECTION 3.02. No Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by Seller and the execution, delivery and performance of the
Ancillary Agreements by Seller and/or Selling Subsidiaries that are a party
thereto, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, do not and will not (a) violate or conflict with the articles, other
constituent documents or by-laws of Seller or any Selling Subsidiary, (b)
conflict with or violate any Law or Governmental Order applicable to Seller or
any Selling Subsidiary or to any of the Assets (assuming the satisfaction of the
condition in Section 8.01(b)) or (c) result in any material breach of, or
constitute a material default (or event which with the giving of notice or lapse
of time, or both, would become a default) under, or give to any Person any

WARRANTIES MADE BY SELLER IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE IN LIEU OF AND ARE EXCLUSIVE OF

DISCLAIM ANY SUCH OTHER OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES.

their execution the Ancillary Agreements will be, duly executed and delivered by
Purchaser, and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Seller)
this Agreement constitutes, and upon their execution the Ancillary Agreements
will constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations of Purchaser, enforceable
against Purchaser in accordance with their terms, except as such enforcement may

affecting generally the enforcement of the rights of contracting parties and
subject to a court's discretionary authority with respect to the granting of a
decree ordering specific performance or other equitable remedies.

          SECTION 4.02. No Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by Purchaser, and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will not (a)

(b) conflict with or violate any Law or Governmental Order applicable to
Purchaser (assuming the satisfaction of the condition in Section 8.02(b)) or (c)

the ability of Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, or
as set forth in Section 4.03 of the Disclosure Schedule.

          SECTION 4.04. Absence of Litigation. There are no Actions pending or,
to the knowledge of Purchaser, threatened which relate to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or which, individually or in the aggregate,
would materially and adversely affect Purchaser's ability to consummate the

paid by Purchaser, no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to a fee
or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Purchaser.

not be required to (or cause the Selling Subsidiaries to) increase the
compensation of, or provide (or cause the Selling Subsidiaries to provide) any
other retention incentive to, any such key employee beyond that currently
provided.

          (b) By way of amplification and not limitation, except (A) as
otherwise expressly set forth herein, (B) to the extent relating solely to
Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities, (C) as disclosed in Section 5.01(a) of

                                       33

          (vi) make or commit to make any capital expenditures in excess of

          (xi) otherwise take any action or engage in any transaction which

     to materiality inaccurate in any respect, and any representation or
     warranty which is not so qualified inaccurate in any material respect as of
     the Closing Date;

          (xii) adopt or amend any Benefit Plan or employment contract with any
     Business Employee or enter into, adopt, extend (beyond the Closing Date),

     that are material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Business,
     except (x) inventory sold in the ordinary course of business and (y) any
     Excluded Asset; or

          (xvii) authorize, or commit or agree (orally or in writing) to take,
     any of the foregoing actions.

          (c) Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts promptly to notify
Purchaser in writing of the occurrence of any matter or event that is material
to the Assets or the condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations,
working capital or properties of the Business including the receipt of any
written notice by Seller or a Selling Subsidiary to the effect that a creditor,
client, customer or other third party having a material business relationship
with the Business intends to change such relationship because of the purchase
and sale of the Assets or the consummation of any other transaction contemplated
hereby.

          SECTION 5.02. Consultation. In connection with the continuing
operation of the Business between the date of this Agreement and the Closing,
Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts in
good faith on a regular and frequent basis to consult with representatives for
Purchaser regarding material operational developments, including the entering
into, or the termination or amendment in any material respect, of any Customer
Contract or Material Contract, and the general status of ongoing operations as
reasonably requested by Purchaser or such representatives, in each case to the
extent permitted by Law. Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries each acknowledge
that any such consultation shall not constitute a waiver by Purchaser of any
rights it may have under this Agreement, and that Purchaser shall not have any
liability or responsibility for any actions of Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries
or any of their respective officers or directors with respect to matters that
are the subject of such consultation unless Purchaser expressly consents to such
action in writing.

          SECTION 5.03. Agreement Not To Compete. (a) Each of Seller and the
Selling Subsidiaries understands that Purchaser shall be entitled to protect and
preserve the going concern value of the Business to the extent permitted by Law
and that Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement absent the
provisions of this Section 5.03 and, therefore, for a period of two years from
the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not
to, directly or indirectly engage in the design, development and production
("Competitive Activities") of products that are directly in competition with the
Products set forth on Section 5.03 of the Disclosure Schedule ("Competitive
Products"), except that if any goods or services were not sold by the Business
during the period of time that it was owned by Seller (collectively, "Permitted
Goods and Services"), Seller may design, develop or produce any such Permitted
Goods and Services notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement.

          (b) Section 5.03(a) shall be deemed not breached as a result of any of
the following: (i) the ownership by Seller or any of its Affiliates of (A) less
than an aggregate of 15% of any class of stock of a Person engaged, directly or
indirectly, in Competitive Activities; (B) less than 10% in value of any class
or series of indebtedness of a Person engaged, directly or indirectly, in
Competitive Activities; (C) a Person that engages, directly or indirectly, in
Competitive Activities if such Competitive Activities account for less than 15%
of such Person's consolidated annual revenues for the fiscal year preceding the
acquisition of such Person by

                                       35
<page>

Seller or its Affiliates or (D) a Person that engages, directly or indirectly,
in Competitive Activities if such Competitive Activities account for more than
15% of such Person's consolidated annual revenues for the fiscal year preceding
the acquisition of such Person by Seller or its Affiliates and if Seller or such
Affiliate ceases such Competitive Activities (by divesting Competitive Products
or otherwise) within one year of having acquired ownership of such Person; (ii)
Seller's (or an Affiliate's) acting as a reseller, consultant or systems
integrator with respect to Products or Competitive Products, including the
implementation or modification thereof; (iii) Seller's (or an Affiliate's)
entering into a strategic alliance, marketing agreement, referral arrangement or
similar cooperative arrangement with respect to the marketing and sale of
Competitive Products manufactured by Persons other than Seller and its
Affiliates; or (iv) the design, development or production by Seller or any of
its Affiliates of software and other products solely for its internal use.

          (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, it is
understood and agreed that the remedy of indemnity payments pursuant to Article
X and other remedies at law would be inadequate in the case of any breach of the
covenants contained in Section 5.03(a). Purchaser shall be entitled to equitable
relief, including the remedy of specific performance, with respect to any breach
or attempted breach of such covenants.

          SECTION 5.04. Access to Information. From the date hereof until the
Closing (upon reasonable advance notice to Seller) during normal business hours,
so that an uninterrupted and efficient transfer of the Business may be
accomplished, Seller shall, and shall cause the Selling Subsidiaries and the
officers, directors, employees, auditors and agents of the Business to, (a)
afford the officers, employees and authorized agents and representatives of
Purchaser full access to the offices, properties, books and records of the
Business and (b) furnish to the officers, employees and authorized agents and
representatives of Purchaser such available additional financial and operating
data and other information regarding the Business as Purchaser may from time to
time reasonably request; and use its reasonable best efforts to cause
independent public accountants for Sellers to permit Purchaser's independent
public accountants to inspect its accounting work papers and other records to
the extent relating to the Business and the Assets, all in order that Purchaser
may have full opportunity to make such investigations as it shall desire to make
of the Business; provided, however, that Seller shall not be required to provide
(or cause to be provided) any such information or access to the extent that such
information or access would cause Seller or any Selling Subsidiary to be in
breach of any confidentiality restrictions applicable to it.

          SECTION 5.05. Confidentiality. (a) Subject to Section 6.01, the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated March 13, 2001, as amended August 24,
2001 between Seller and Purchaser (the "Confidentiality Agreement") is hereby
incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in full force and effect and
survive the Closing, except that the non-disclosure and non-use obligations of
Purchaser under the Confidentiality Agreement in respect of information relating
to the Business shall terminate at the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, the
no-hire and non-solicitation provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement with
respect to employees shall not prohibit Purchaser, prior to the termination of
this Agreement, from making offers of employment to the Business Employees in
accordance with Section 6.01, provided that Purchaser shall not hire any
Business Employee prior to the Closing. If this Agreement is, for any reason,
terminated prior to

                                       36
<page>

the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full
force and effect in all respects.

          (b) After the Closing Date, except as may be required by Law, neither
Seller nor any Selling Subsidiary nor any of their Affiliates nor any of the
respective successors and assigns of Seller, Selling Subsidiaries and such
Affiliates will, and each shall instruct its officers, directors, employees and
advisors not to, retain any document, databases or other media embodying
Transferred Intellectual Property or use, publish or disclose to any third
person any such Transferred Intellectual Property; provided, however, that
Seller shall be entitled to retain copies of any of the foregoing to the extent
necessary in connection with prosecuting or defending any matter not assumed by
Purchaser.

          SECTION 5.06. Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Consents. (a) Each
party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all authorizations,
consents, orders and approvals of all federal, state and local regulatory bodies
and officials or other legal requirements, including any required consultation
with works counsels or workers' representatives, that may be or become necessary
for its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations
pursuant to, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and will cooperate
fully with the other party in promptly seeking to obtain all such
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals. The parties hereto will not take
any action that would have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the
receipt of any required approvals or the satisfaction of any condition in
Article VIII.

          (b) Purchaser and Seller each agrees to make an appropriate filing of
a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and any filings or
applications required under the laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction, including the
European Union, or any nation thereof, as required with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby within ten Business Days after the date hereof
and to supply promptly any additional information and documentary material that
may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or the laws of any non-U.S.
jurisdiction. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under the HSR Act.

          (c) Each party hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain and to cooperate in obtaining any other consents and approvals which may
be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements.

          SECTION 5.07. Bulk Sales. Purchaser hereby waives compliance by Seller
and the Selling Subsidiaries with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer laws
of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the Business to Purchaser.
Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser against any and all
liabilities that may be asserted by third parties against Purchaser as a result
of noncompliance by Seller or any Selling Subsidiary with any such bulk transfer
law.

          SECTION 5.08. Insurance. (a) Effective 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date,
the Business shall cease to be insured by Seller's and Selling Subsidiaries'
insurance policies. With respect to events or circumstances covered by insurance
coverage written on an "occurrence basis," Seller and Selling Subsidiaries shall
have no liability for occurrences that take place on

                                       37
<PAGE>

and after 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date. With respect to insurance coverage
written on a "claims made" basis, Seller and Selling Subsidiaries shall have no
liability under such insurance coverage for claims made after 12:01 a.m. on the
Closing Date.

          (b) From and after the Closing Date, Seller and the Selling
Subsidiaries shall not have any liability for self-insured workers' compensation
claims with respect to the Assumed Employees in existence on the Closing Date or
arising from any event or circumstance taking place subsequent to the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller and the
Selling Subsidiaries shall be responsible for all claims or payments related to
events occurring on or prior to the Closing Date except to the extent that an
event occurring subsequent to the Closing Date results in additional claims or
payments. Purchaser shall take all steps necessary under any Law to assume the
liability for self-insured workers' compensation pursuant to this Section
5.08(b) and shall fully indemnify Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries with
respect to any liability, claim, damage or expense of any kind whatsoever
arising out of or relating to any self-insured workers' compensation claim
assumed by Purchaser hereunder. Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries shall fully
indemnify Purchaser with respect to any liability, claim, damage or expense of
any kind whatsoever arising out of or relating to any self-insured workers'
compensation claims retained by Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries hereunder.
Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries in order to
obtain the return or release of bonds or securities or indemnifications given by
Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries to any state in connection with workers'
compensation self-insurance with respect to the Business; and, in order to
effectuate such return or release, Purchaser shall, to the extent required by
any state, post its own bonds, letters of credit, indemnifications or other
securities in substitution therefor.

          SECTION 5.09. Certain Services and Benefits Provided by Affiliates.
Purchaser acknowledges that the Business currently receives from Seller and its
Affiliates certain administrative and corporate services and benefits,
including: computer and information processing services; finance, accounting and
payroll services; facilities management services, treasury services (including
banking, insurance, administration, taxation and internal audit); general
administrative services; executive and management services; legal services; and
human resources services. Purchaser further acknowledges that, except as
otherwise expressly provided in the Transition Services Agreement, all such
services and benefits shall cease, and any agreement in respect thereof shall
terminate, as of the Closing Date and Seller acknowledges that no further
payments with respect to such services shall be payable to Seller or any of its
Affiliates as of the Closing Date.

          SECTION 5.10. Further Action. (a) Until the Closing, the parties shall
use their reasonable best efforts to cause and facilitate the prompt
satisfaction of all conditions in Article VIII, and to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          (b) From and after the Closing Date, all of the parties hereto shall
execute and deliver such documents and other papers and take such further
actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and give effect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after
the Closing (i) Seller shall (and shall cause the Selling Subsidiaries to) do
all things

                                       38
<page>

necessary, proper or advisable under Laws as requested by Purchaser (A) to put
Purchaser in effective possession, ownership and control of the Assets and
Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller for such purpose and (B) to assure that
Seller, or any of the Selling Subsidiaries, as the case may be, rather than
Purchaser, is the obligor in respect of all Retained Liabilities, and Purchaser
shall cooperate with Seller for such purposes, and (ii) Purchaser shall do all
things necessary, proper and advisable under Laws as requested by Seller to
assure that Purchaser, rather than Seller or any Selling Subsidiary, is the
obligor in respect of all Assumed Liabilities, and Seller shall cooperate with
Purchaser for such purposes. Purchaser shall, upon the request of Seller, make
the Business Employees available and cooperate in all reasonable respects with
Seller and its Affiliates in the preparation for, and defense of, any lawsuit,
arbitration or other Action (whether disclosed or not disclosed in the
Disclosure Schedule) filed or claimed against Seller, its Affiliates, agents,
directors, officers and employees, whether currently pending or asserted in the
future, concerning the operation or conduct of the Business prior to the Closing
Date (including by making Business Employees available to provide information
and discovery documentation, take depositions and testify); provided, however,
that Seller gives Purchaser reasonable advance notice and that such assistance
does not interfere in any material respect with the operation of the Business as
then conducted by Purchaser.

          SECTION 5.11. Ancillary Agreements. On or prior to the Closing Date
each of Seller and Purchaser shall execute and deliver, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates that are party thereto to execute and deliver, each of the
Ancillary Agreements. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to agree to a Real Estate License Agreement pursuant to
which, among other things, the use of certain leased property will be licensed
to Purchaser.

          SECTION 5.12. Obtaining Consents. Before, at and after the Closing,
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as soon as
practicable, all consents and waivers that are required to transfer to Purchaser
all of the rights and obligations under each Material Contract and each other
contract, permit and license constituting an Asset or an Assumed Liability, as
the case may be. At least five Business Days before the Closing, Seller shall
deliver a written notice to Purchaser setting forth a complete list of such
Material Contracts and such other contracts, permits and licenses that,
notwithstanding Seller's commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents
required for the transfer thereof, will not be fully transferred at the Closing.
The delivery of such notice shall not relieve either party of its obligations
under the first sentence of this Section 5.12. Seller and Purchaser shall
cooperate in any lawful arrangement to provide that Purchaser shall receive all
benefits and be responsible for all liabilities (except for pre-Closing
liabilities that are lost profits, consequential, special, indirect or punitive
damages) under each such contracts, permits and licenses until all necessary
consents are obtained and the full transfer thereof is effective. Nothing in
this Agreement shall be construed as an attempt to transfer any contract, permit
or license that is by its terms non-transferable without the consent of any
Governmental Authority or another party thereto.

          SECTION 5.13. Retained Contracts and Identified Contracts. (a) On or
prior to the Closing, (i) Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to assign and delegate to Purchaser (or one more Subsidiaries of Purchaser
designated by Purchaser), effective as of the Closing, the rights and
obligations, as the case may be, under certain contracts of Seller and its
Affiliates (the "Retained Contracts"), which rights and obligations are related
to the Business and

                                       39
<page>

described in Section 5.13(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, and (ii) Purchaser
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to accept and assume (or cause one
or more of its Subsidiaries to assume), effective as of the Closing, such rights
and obligations, as the case may be.

          (b) If (i) any of the rights under the Retained Contracts that are
described in Section 5.13(a) of the Disclosure Schedule is not assigned and
accepted pursuant to Section 5.13(a) on or prior to the Closing or (ii) any of
the obligations under the Retained Contracts that are described in Section
5.13(a) of the Disclosure Schedule is not delegated and assumed pursuant to
Section 5.13(a) on or prior to the Closing, then to the extent reasonably
practicable, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into
an alternative, lawful arrangement under which Purchaser (or one more
Subsidiaries of Purchaser designated by Purchaser) shall, effective as of the
Closing, have the benefit of such right or the burden of such obligation, as the
case may be, in each case as if such right had been assigned and accepted or
such obligation had been delegated and assumed, as the case may be.

          (c) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver, or to cause to be delivered, to
Purchaser, copies of the Customer Contracts identified on Section 3.15(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule as "Identified Contracts" (collectively, the "Identified
Contracts"). If any such Identified Contract was entered into in the ordinary
course of business and contains commercially reasonable terms (which shall be
determined by reference to the other Customer Contracts), then the Liabilities
arising from any act, omission, event or circumstance occurring or arising
thereunder shall be Assumed Liabilities, provided that such Identified Contract
was delivered pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.13(c). If any
such Identified Contract was not entered into in the ordinary course of business
or contains terms that are not commercially reasonable (which shall be
determined by reference to the other Customer Contracts), then Seller and
Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to enter into a lawful arrangement
pursuant to which the benefits and liabilities thereunder are allocated between
Seller and Purchaser in a reasonable manner consistent with the other Customer
Contracts. If copies of any such Identified Contract are not delivered pursuant
to the first sentence of Section 5.13(c), then Seller and Purchaser shall
cooperate in good faith to enter into a lawful arrangement pursuant to which
Purchaser will support the license and maintenance obligations in respect of
such Identified Contracts (which obligations shall be determined by reference to
the other Customer Contracts) and will be entitled to receive the benefits of
such Identified Contracts (which benefits shall be determined based on the fees
and payments currently being paid by the applicable customer).

          SECTION 5.14. Deletion of Non-Transferred Software. Purchaser agrees
that, following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not use and shall cause each
of Purchaser's subsidiaries not to use any items of Business Software or other
third-party software loaded on the Transferred Equipment as of the Closing Date
which is not to be transferred or licensed to Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement, and which does not constitute an Asset. Purchaser shall, as soon as
is reasonably practical, and in any event no later than forty-five (45) days
following the Closing, delete all such non-transferred software from any of the
Transferred Equipment on which it is installed.

          SECTION 5.15. Audited Financial Statements. Prior to the date that is
45 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser
(a) audited balance sheets

                                       40
<page>
and related statements of profit and loss and cash flows as of the end of and
for each of the years ended December 31, 1998, December 31, 1999 and December
31, 2000 based on U.S. GAAP and (b) unaudited balance sheets and statements of
net assets and related statements of profit and loss and cash flows for and as
of the end of the nine month periods ended September 30, 2000 and September 30,
2001, in each case based on U.S. GAAP and on a stand-alone basis with respect to
the Business. Seller understands that such financial statements will be filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Seller will assist,
and request its accountants to assist, with respect to such filing and any other
filings with the SEC or any other offering documents that include such financial
statements, and Purchaser shall pay the cost of any consent or "comfort" letter
of Seller's accountants required in connection with the inclusion of such
financial statements in filings or offering documents. If the Closing Date is
prior to or on December 15, 2001, (i) Seller will prepare and deliver, on the
earlier of 45 days after the Closing Date or January 10, 2002, an unaudited
statement of net assets as of the Closing Date and related statements of profit
and loss for the period beginning October 1, 2001 and ending on the Closing
Date, based on U.S. GAAP, and (ii) if the Closing Date is after December 15,
2001 but on or prior to December 31, 2001, Seller will prepare and deliver prior
to January 10, 2002, such financial data relating to the Closing Date and such
period beginning October 1, 2001 and ending on the Closing Date as the parties
may reasonably agree. If the Closing Date is after December 31, 2001 but on or
prior to March 25, 2002, Seller will prepare and deliver no later than the
earlier of 45 days after the Closing Date and March 30, 2002, an unaudited
statement of net assets as of the Closing Date and related statements of profit
and loss for the period beginning January 1, 2002 and ending on the Closing
Date, based on U.S. GAAP and for the period beginning October 1, 2001 and ending
December 31, 2001. If the Closing is after March 25, 2002, Seller will prepare
and deliver on the Closing Date audited statement of net assets and related
statements of profit and loss and cash flows as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2001, based on U.S. GAAP and on a stand-alone basis with respect to
the Business. If (x) the Closing is after December 31, 2001 but on or prior to
March 25, 2002 and (y) Purchaser is required to file audited financial
statements related to the Business in connection with a transaction, other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Seller shall use its reasonable
best efforts to assist Purchaser in obtaining an audited statement of net assets
and related statements of profit and loss and cash flows as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2001, at Purchaser's expense. Purchaser shall take all
reasonable measures requested by Seller to cooperate with Seller in connection
with Seller's efforts to satisfy its obligations under this Section 5.15.

          SECTION 5.16. Exclusivity. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and its
Affiliates will not (and Seller will cause each of its employees, officers,
directors, representatives and agents not to) (a) solicit, initiate, consider,
entertain, encourage or accept the submission of any proposal or offer from any
third party relating to the direct or indirect acquisition of the Business or
(except to the extent permitted by 5.01(b)(ii)) any material portion of the
Assets, or (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations (and Seller shall
immediately cease any discussions or negotiations that are ongoing) regarding,
furnish any information with respect to, assist in or participate in or
facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by any third party to do or
seek any of the foregoing. Seller will notify Purchaser promptly (but in any
event within 48 hours) after Seller's receipt from any third party of any
proposal, offer, inquiry or contact with respect to any of the foregoing
(including the terms thereof and the identity of such third party).

                                       41
<page>

          SECTION 5.17. Certain Retained Liabilities. Purchaser shall notify
Seller promptly upon receipt of any information relating to any Liabilities
described in Section 2.02(b)(vii) and shall take all reasonable measures
requested by Seller to cooperate with Seller in managing and mitigating any such
Liability, including among other things, by providing Seller (i) the necessary
assistance of Purchaser's personnel, (ii) access to the relevant source code and
other technical data and information and (iii) access to relevant records, in
each case upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours. Seller shall
promptly reimburse Purchaser for all reasonable costs incurred by Purchaser with
Seller's prior approval in connection with Purchaser's satisfaction of such
obligations.

          SECTION 5.18. Covenant Not To Sue. Purchaser covenants to Seller not
to sue Seller, its Affiliates, its agents or any customer of Seller or its
Affiliates for patent infringement arising after the Closing Date based upon the
use of technology, products or processes covered by the Transferred Patents, or
for copyright infringement arising after the Closing Date based upon Seller's
use of the Transferred Copyrights, or for any other claim under any of the
Transferred Intellectual Property based upon Seller's or its agents' use of such
Intellectual Property, in each case so long as such use (x) is reasonably
related to business currently being conducted by Seller or its Affiliates
(including any reasonable extensions thereof) and (y) is not a Competitive
Activity, regardless of whether Section 5.03 is in effect.

          SECTION 5.19. Additional IP Rights. The parties agree for a period of
twenty four (24) months after the Closing Date, that if Purchaser believes that
an Intellectual Property right owned by Seller, directly or indirectly, as of
the Closing Date was used primarily in the Products as of the Closing Date or
primarily in the operation of the Business as of the Closing Date (and, with
respect to Patents, being limited to those Patents owned by Seller or a Selling
Subsidiary where at least one inventor was directly involved in the design and
development of the Products), and is not listed on the respective schedule
herein for the Transferred Intellectual Property, it promptly shall notify
Seller thereof. Upon receipt of such notice by Seller, the parties will analyze
the specific Intellectual Property right at issue, and upon a mutual
determination by the parties that such Intellectual Property right was used
primarily in the Products or primarily in the operation of the Business as of
the Closing Date, as discussed herein, such Intellectual Property right will be
transferred to Purchaser; provided that the foregoing shall not restrict any
party hereto from referring to arbitration pursuant to Section 11.13 a dispute
as to whether any such Intellectual Property right was used primarily in the
Products or primarily in the operation of the Business. Any such Intellectual
Property right transferred to Purchaser pursuant to this Section 5.19 will be
subject to Section 5.18; provided that in event any such Intellectual Property
right is material to a product or service of Seller or its Affiliates, the
parties agree Seller shall receive a license to use such Intellectual Property
right at the time such Intellectual Property right is transferred in accordance
with this Section 5.19, the terms of which license shall be negotiated in good
faith by Purchaser and Seller prior to such transfer, which terms at a minimum
shall provide that such license shall not require the payment of any royalty or
other payment by Seller for the use of such rights and such right shall be
assignable by Seller in the event of a divestiture, the terms of which
assignment shall be negotiated in good faith.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                                EMPLOYEE MATTERS

          SECTION 6.01. Specified Business Employees. (a) Purchaser shall,
within fourteen (14) Business Days after the date hereof, offer employment on
terms consistent with this Article VI, effective on the Closing (each such offer
an "Employment Offer"), to each Specified Business Employee employed with the
Business as of the date of such Employment Offer; provided that with respect to
any such Specified Business Employees whose employment is transferred to
Purchaser or a Purchaser Subsidiary by operation of Law, Purchaser shall provide
such individual with a transfer letter in accordance with applicable Law in lieu
of such Employment Offer. Each Employment Offer together with any such transfer
letter shall be made in the form of an offer letter setting forth the terms of
such Employment Offer and specifying a deadline of no more than 14 days after
the date of the letter by which such Employment Offer must be accepted (each,
together with any such transfer letter, an "Offer Letter"). The Employment Offer
will offer employment for each Specified Business Employee at the same location
or a location in reasonable proximity to the location at which such Specified
Business Employee worked immediately prior to Closing. The form of the Offer
Letters shall be as prescribed by Purchaser and reasonably agreed to by Seller.

          (b) Effective at the Closing, Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries
shall terminate the employment of each Specified Business Employee who is
employed in the United States (each, a "US Specified Business Employee") or who
is employed in a location other than in the United States or Europe (each, a
"Foreign Specified Business Employee") and in each case has accepted Purchaser's
Employment Offer; provided that Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries shall not be
required to take any action that would subject Seller or the Selling
Subsidiaries to an obligation to provide severance to such U.S. Specified
Business Employees or Foreign Specified Business Employees. The Purchaser or the
applicable Purchaser Subsidiary shall immediately hire on the terms set forth
herein and in the Employment Offers all US Specified Business Employees and
Foreign Specified Business Employees.

          (c) To the extent required by Law, the employment of each Specified
Business Employee employed in Europe (each, a "European Specified Business
Employee") shall transfer at the Closing to Purchaser or the applicable
Purchaser Subsidiary. To the extent required by Law, the employment of each
Business Employee employed in Europe who is not a European Specified Business
Employee (each, a "Mandatory Business Employee") shall transfer at the Closing
to Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser Subsidiary. The term "Mandatory
Business Employee" only includes those Business Employees employed in Europe (i)
who are not Specified Business Employees and (ii) for whom applicable Law
specifically requires a transfer of employment.

          (d) The "Assumed Employees" shall be (i) each Specified Business
Employee who accepts an Employment Offer and commences active employment with
the Purchaser or a Purchaser Subsidiary in accordance with the terms thereof on
or after the Closing Date and (ii) each Mandatory Business Employee who
transfers to Purchaser or a Purchaser Subsidiary by operation of Law; provided
that (A) each Specified Business Employee who is on leave of absence on the
Closing Date shall become an Assumed Employee on the date he or she reports

                                       43
<page>

for active employment with the Purchaser or a Purchaser Subsidiary after the
Closing, which in any case must be within one year of the Closing; and (B) each
Specified Business Employee who has accepted an Employment Offer and is
described in Section 6.02(a)(iv) shall become an Assumed Employee on the date he
or she reports for active employment with the Purchaser or a Purchaser
Subsidiary after the date the Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser Subsidiary
acquires all work permits required to employ such Specified Business Employee.
Seller and its Affiliates and Purchaser and its Affiliates shall cooperate in
good faith to take any action required by Law to implement the transfer of
employment of the Assumed Employees.

          (e) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement,
Seller or the Applicable Seller Subsidiary shall provide such notice to, and
consultation rights with, the Business Employees (or their representatives) as
are required by Law and Purchaser agrees that it will provide such information
as is required by Seller or such Selling Subsidiary for this purpose and shall
reasonably cooperate with Seller in connection with these consultations.

          SECTION 6.02. Assumed Employees. (a) (i) During the period commencing
at Closing and ending on July 1, 2002, Purchaser shall provide each Assumed
Employee with the same base salary as the base salary provided by Seller or any
Selling Subsidiary to such Assumed Employee immediately prior to Closing. During
the period commencing at Closing and ending on December 31, 2001, Purchaser
shall provide each Assumed Employee with the same sales compensation levels as
the sales compensation levels provided by Seller or any Selling Subsidiary to
such Assumed Employee immediately prior to Closing.

          (ii) Commencing January 1, 2002, Purchaser shall provide the Assumed
     Employees with an annual bonus plan that will provide for annual payments
     and will incorporate business performance and individual performance
     factors; provided that, the identity of the Assumed Employees eligible for
     such plan, the amount of the bonus opportunity and the performance targets
     shall be determined by Purchaser and any bonus earned by a Assumed Employee
     shall be paid at such time and in such manner as set forth in Purchaser's
     applicable bonus plan. (iii) During the one-year period immediately
     following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide the Assumed Employees
     with employee benefits and perquisites at levels that are substantially
     similar in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees
     of Purchaser; provided that during the six month period immediately
     following the Closing, the Purchaser and the Purchaser Subsidiaries shall
     provide Assumed Employees with the severance benefits provided by Seller or
     any Selling Subsidiary to such Assumed Employees immediately prior to
     Closing to the extent such benefits were disclosed to Purchaser prior to
     the Closing.

          (iv) Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
     promptly procure working permits for any Assumed Employee who needs such a
     permit in relation to his or her employment. Section 6.02(a)(iv) of the
     Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of the Specified Business Employees
     who, as of the date hereof, must maintain work permits in relation to their
     employment. With respect to any such Assumed Employees for whom Purchaser
     is unable to procure such a working permit on or prior to the Closing Date,
     Seller shall continue to employ each such Assumed Employee (each, a "Loaned

                                       44
<page>

     Employee") and lease such employee to Purchaser until such time that
     Purchaser obtains the necessary work permits for such employee (the "Lease
     Period"), which, provided that Seller promptly provides Purchaser with all
     required immigration information in its possession or control, shall not
     exceed six months. With respect to the Loaned Employees, Purchaser and
     Seller or applicable Selling Subsidiary shall execute a Loaned Employee
     Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F.

          (v) Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall lease the services of
     the persons whose names are listed in Section 6.02(a)(v) of the Disclosure
     Schedule from Seller for the period set forth in Section 6.01(a)(v) of the
     Disclosure Schedule and may not, without the prior written consent of
     Seller, solicit, attempt to solicit, or make any offer of employment to
     such persons during the period agreed by the parties. With respect to such
     persons, Purchaser and Seller or the applicable Selling Subsidiary shall
     execute a Transitional Employee Agreement in the form attached hereto as
     Exhibit G.

          (vi) Purchaser shall not communicate with any of the Specified
     Business Employees or provide to any Specified Business Employee any
     written communications or literature (including the Employment Offers)
     without previously notifying Seller and giving Seller a reasonable
     opportunity to review and comment on any such written communications or
     literature. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of Seller
     (which shall not unreasonably be withheld), Purchaser and the Purchaser
     Subsidiaries shall not (i) send any written communication to all, or a
     material percentage, of the Specified Business Employees or (ii) provide
     any material directions or orders regarding the Business to Specified
     Business Employees; provided that Seller shall have been deemed to have
     consented to any such communications if Seller's response is not received
     by Purchaser within 24 hours of the time Purchaser provided such
     communication to Seller for review.

          (vii) Seller or the applicable Selling Subsidiary shall be responsible
     for all claims incurred by Assumed Employees and their dependents on or
     prior to the date such individuals become Assumed Employees under Section
     6.01(d) hereof (the "Cutoff Date") under medical, dental, hospitalization,
     vision, life, prescription drug, disability and other similar benefit
     plans. Purchaser shall be responsible for all claims incurred by Assumed
     Employees and their dependents after the Cutoff Date under medical, dental,
     hospitalization, vision, life, prescription drug, disability and other
     similar benefit plans of Purchaser. For purposes of this Section
     6.02(a)(vii), a claim shall be deemed to have been incurred under a
     medical, dental, hospitalization, vision or other similar health plan on
     the date on which the service to which such claim relates is rendered;
     provided that the Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries shall be responsible
     for hospitalization expenses incurred by Assumed Employees or their
     dependents after the Cutoff Date to the extent such Assumed Employees or
     their dependents were hospitalized on the Cutoff Date and such expenses
     relate to that hospitalization.

          (viii) To the extent permitted by Law, Purchaser shall grant each
     Assumed Employee credit for eligibility and vesting purposes only under
     applicable Purchaser Plans for all periods of service for which such
     Assumed Employee was granted credit under a similar Benefit Plan, if any,
     in which such Assumed Employee was eligible to

                                     45
<page>

     participate immediately prior to the Closing. For purposes of determining
     the severance, vacation and sick leave entitlements only of each such
     Assumed Employee following the Closing, Purchaser shall take into account
     all service taken into account under the severance, vacation and sick leave
     Benefit Plans, respectively, in which such Assumed Employee was eligible to
     participate immediately prior to the Closing or under any employment
     contract applicable to such Assumed Employee. For purposes of this Section
     6.02(a)(viii), the term "Purchaser Plan" means an employee benefit plan,
     program or arrangement maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates in which
     an Assumed Employee is or becomes eligible to participate following the
     Closing.

          (ix) With respect to the employee benefit plans of Purchaser that are
     dental, medical or health plans (the "Purchaser Welfare Plans") in which
     the Assumed Employees become eligible to participate after Closing,
     Purchaser shall (A) waive any exclusions for pre-existing conditions under
     Purchaser Welfare Plans that would result in a lack of coverage for any
     condition for which the applicable Assumed Employee or his or her covered
     dependants would have been entitled to coverage under the corresponding
     Benefit Plan in which such Assumed Employee or his or her covered
     dependents was an active participant immediately prior to his or her
     transfer to Purchaser Welfare Plan; (B) waive any waiting period under such
     Purchaser Welfare Plan to the extent that such period exceeds the
     corresponding waiting period under the corresponding Benefit Plan in which
     such Assumed Employee or his or her covered dependents was an active
     participant immediately prior to his or her transfer to Purchaser Welfare
     Plan (after taking into account the service credit provided for herein for
     purposes of satisfying such waiting period); and (C) provide each Assumed
     Employee or his or her covered dependents with credit for any deductibles
     paid by such Assumed Employee or his or her covered dependents prior to his
     or her transfer to Purchaser Welfare Plan (to the same extent such credit
     was given under the applicable Benefit Plan prior to such transfer) in
     satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under
     such Purchaser Welfare Plan for the plan year that includes such transfer;
     provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result
     in duplication of benefits. Nothing herein shall obligate Purchaser to
     amend any Purchaser Welfare Plan to cover any condition or treatment that
     is otherwise not covered by Purchaser's Welfare Plan.

          (x) Purchaser (A) shall credit each Assumed Employee for all vacation
     earned but not taken by, or paid out to, Assumed Employees as of Closing
     under the terms of the applicable Benefit Plan in effect on the date
     hereof, but only to the extent Seller has made the payment required in this
     Section 6.02(a)(x) and (B) shall not reduce any Assumed Employee's annual
     number of paid vacation days below the number of paid vacation days to
     which such Assumed Employee is entitled immediately prior to Closing,
     except that Assumed Employees in category JCI/1, 2 or 3 who have less than
     five years of service with Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries (including
     any predecessor entities) shall receive the same number of annual vacation
     days that similarly situated employees of the Purchaser receive (but not
     less than ten annual vacation days), and no later than thirty days after
     the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay each such Assumed Employee a one-time
     cash payment equal to the excess of the value of fifteen vacation days over
     the number of annual vacation days provided by Purchaser in order to
     compensate such Assumed Employee for the reduction in vacation accruals in
     the future. Seller shall pay

                                       46
<page>

     Purchaser at the Closing an amount in cash equal to the value of the
     vacation credited to Assumed Employees under Section 6.02(a)(x)(A), above.

          (xi) For the period ending at the Closing, Seller or its applicable
     Selling Subsidiary shall provide each of the Specified Business Employees
     listed on Section 6.02(a)(xi) of the Disclosure Schedule with relocation
     benefits under Seller's current relocation policies ("Seller's Relocation
     Policies"), including making all payments related to tax gross-up costs and
     tax preparation fees. From the period beginning at the Closing and ending
     on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser or the applicable
     Purchaser Subsidiary will provide the same such relocation benefits
     (pursuant to the terms and conditions of Seller's Relocation Policies) to
     such Specified Business Employees. At the end of such one-year period, if
     any such Specified Business Employee chooses to relocate to the location at
     which he or she worked for Seller prior to receiving such relocation
     benefits, Purchaser shall pay for such relocation pursuant to its own
     relocation policies. In addition and to the extent applicable, Purchaser
     shall be responsible for the relocation of offices of the Assumed Employees
     from locations of Seller and its Affiliates to locations of Purchaser and
     its Affiliates within a reasonable time after the Closing Date.

          (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Purchaser and the Purchaser
Subsidiaries shall comply with applicable Law in (A) providing Employment Offers
to European Specified Business Employees and Foreign Specified Business
Employees and (B) employing Foreign Assumed Employees after the Closing, and
(ii) the application of the provisions of Section 6.02(b) shall be modified with
respect to Foreign Specified Business Employees to prevent duplication of any
benefits such persons may receive in connection with the termination of their
employment by Seller or its Affiliates. In addition, to the extent necessary to
avoid the payment of severance in connection with the transfer of Foreign
Specified Business Employees to the Purchaser or the Purchaser Subsidiaries at
the Closing, the Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser Subsidiary shall provide
at the Closing compensation and benefits to each Foreign Specified Business
Employee that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such
Foreign Specified Business Employee by Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries
immediately prior to Closing.

          SECTION 6.03. Foreign Assumed Employees. (a) Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein the following principles shall apply to Foreign
Assumed Employees:

          (i) With respect to any obligation or liability related to any Foreign
     Assumed Employee that (X) is accrued as of the Closing or is based on such
     Foreign Assumed Employee's service before the Closing, and (Z) that is
     transferred to Purchaser or its Affiliates (by operation of law or
     otherwise) ("Transferred Obligations"), Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries
     shall promptly pay Purchaser an amount in cash equal to (A) the Transferred
     Obligations earned or accrued as of the Closing Date, taking into account a
     reasonable allowance for (I) the anticipated growth after the Closing in
     salary or other factors that increase the final benefit payable to Foreign
     Assumed Employees based on their pre-Closing service (i.e., calculated on a
     projected benefit basis as contemplated by FASB 87) and (II) the increase
     in such Transferred Obligations due to the passage of time

                                     47
<page>

     from the Closing to the date Seller makes any payment required hereunder,
     minus (B) the sum of the fair market value of assets related to such
     Transferred Obligations transferred to Purchaser or its Affiliates and any
     provision for such Transferred Obligations reflected on the Financial
     Statements. In the event the parties cannot agree within 90 days of the
     Closing on the appropriate amount, if any, to be transferred to Purchaser
     pursuant to this clause, the parties shall select an independent third
     party actuary to determine the appropriate amount to transfer, whose
     determination shall be binding upon the parties. The costs of such actuary
     shall be split by the parties.

          (ii) The parties agree that the intent of this Section 6.03(a) is for
     Purchaser and its Affiliates to be financially responsible only for those
     obligations that would have been incurred if the Foreign Assumed Employees
     were first hired in connection with the Business on the Closing and this
     Section shall be interpreted consistently with that intent.

          (iii) The Specified Business Employees and Mandatory Business
     Employees listed in Section 3.19 of the Disclosure Schedule under the
     caption for each jurisdiction shall be referred to herein as such
     jurisdiction's Specified Business Employees or Mandatory Business
     Employees, as applicable and, in each case, the Specified Business
     Employees and Mandatory Business Employees of each jurisdiction who become
     Assumed Employees pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall be referred to herein
     as such jurisdiction's Foreign Assumed Employees.

          (b) Australia. (i) To the extent required by Law, Purchaser will
promptly after the Closing (A) establish or nominate a superannuation fund
pursuant to which Purchaser will provide superannuation benefits to the
Australia Assumed Employees (the "Purchaser's Superannuation Fund"); and (B)
take reasonable steps to provide that each Australia Assumed Employee becomes a
participant in and member of Purchaser's Superannuation Fund, effective as of
Closing.

          (ii) Within a reasonable time after the Closing Date, each Australia
     Assumed Employee will be given the opportunity to complete and sign an
     election form, in the form provided by or otherwise acceptable to the
     trustee(s) of the superannuation fund of Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries
     that covers Australia Assumed Employees (the "Seller's Superannuation
     Fund"), pursuant to which such employee may elect that such trustees either
     (A) provide such Australia Assumed Employee's Termination Benefit (as
     defined below) to such Australia Assumed Employee and transfer any amount
     of such Termination Benefit that is required to be preserved under Law to
     an acceptable superannuation arrangement nominated by such Australia
     Assumed Employee; or (B) transfer such Australia Assumed Employee's
     Termination Benefit in its entirety to an acceptable superannuation
     arrangement nominated by such Australia Assumed Employee (including
     Purchaser's Superannuation Fund). For purposes of this section,
     "Termination Benefit" shall mean, with respect to an Australia Assumed
     Employee, the benefit due to such employee under the governing rules of
     Seller's Superannuation Fund on the termination of such Australia Assumed
     Employee's employment with Seller or applicable Selling Subsidiary.

                                       48
<page>

          (iii) To the extent required by Law, with respect to each Australia
     Assumed Employee, Purchaser will provide each Australia Assumed Employee a
     benefit to be payable on his or her death or permanent disability while
     employed by Purchaser or its affiliate between Closing and the date he or
     she becomes a participant in and member of Purchaser's Superannuation Fund.
     The death or disability benefit payable under this Section 6.03(b)(iii)
     must be of an amount at least equal to the value of the benefit that would
     have been payable from Seller's Superannuation Fund if such Australia
     Assumed Employee had died or become permanently disabled immediately before
     Closing, taking into account for these purposes the Termination Benefit
     paid or payable to or in respect to such Australia Assumed Employee
     pursuant to this Section 6.03(b)(iii); provided that, Seller and the
     Selling Subsidiaries shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser and its
     Affiliates harmless against any cost, claim or expense under this Section
     6.03(b)(iii) to the extent it relates to service of the Australia Assumed
     Employees with Seller and its Affiliates before the Closing.

          (c) Germany. Seller or the applicable Selling Subsidiary shall
endeavor in good faith to obtain the voluntary termination of employment prior
to the Closing of each German Mandatory Business Employee and the execution of
an agreement by each German Mandatory Business Employee in favor of Seller and
the Selling Subsidiaries that waives all claims to reinstatement and all other
employment-related claims of such German Mandatory Business Employee. To induce
the German Mandatory Business Employees to do so, Seller or the applicable
Selling Subsidiary shall be required to offer a severance payment to each German
Mandatory Business Employee in an amount equal to no less than the value of 10
months' of the total compensation paid to, or on behalf of, such German
Mandatory Business Employee.

          (d) Italy. Seller or the applicable Selling Subsidiary shall endeavor
in good faith to obtain the voluntary termination of employment prior to the
Closing of each Italian Mandatory Business Employee and the execution of an
agreement by each Italian Mandatory Business Employee in favor of Seller and the
Selling Subsidiaries that waives all claims to reinstatement and all other
employment-related claims of such Italian Mandatory Business Employee. To induce
the Italian Mandatory Employees to do so, Seller or the applicable Selling
Subsidiary shall be required to offer a severance payment to each Italian
Mandatory Business Employee in an amount equal to no less than the value of 18
months' of the total compensation paid to, or on behalf of, such Italian
Mandatory Business Employee.

          (e) France. If, and only if, Seller or the applicable Selling
Subsidiary is not required to negotiate with the works council representing
employees of Nortel Networks, S.A. or other employee representatives to which a
similar legal scheme and enforcement mechanism apply in connection with the
termination of any French Mandatory Business Employee hereunder, Seller or the
applicable Selling Subsidiary shall endeavor in good faith to obtain the
voluntary termination of employment prior to the Closing of each French
Mandatory Business Employee and the execution of an agreement by each French
Mandatory Business Employee in favor of Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries that
waives all claims to reinstatement and all other employment-related claims of
such French Mandatory Business Employee. To induce the French Mandatory
Employees to do so, Seller or the applicable Selling Subsidiary shall be
required to offer a severance payment to each French Mandatory Business Employee
in an amount equal to no less than the value of (i) 12 months' of the total
compensation paid to, or on

                                       49
<page>

behalf of, each French Mandatory Business Employee with two or more years of
service with Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries or (ii) six months' of the total
compensation paid to, or on behalf of, each French Mandatory Business Employee
with less than two years of service with Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries.

          (f) Other European Jurisdictions. Subject to Section 6.03(c), (d) and
(e) and except as set forth below, Seller or the applicable Selling Subsidiary
shall endeavor in good faith to obtain the voluntary termination of employment
prior to the Closing of all other Mandatory Business Employees and the execution
of an agreement by all other Mandatory Business Employees in favor of Seller and
the Selling Subsidiaries that waives all claims to reinstatement and all other
employment-related claims of such Mandatory Business Employees. To induce the
Mandatory Business Employees to do so, Seller or the applicable Selling
Subsidiary shall be required to offer a severance payment to each such Mandatory
Business Employee in an amount mutually agreed upon by the parties in good
faith, but which shall be consistent with the local practice of each
jurisdiction. This Section 6.03(f) shall not apply to (i) the United Kingdom,
(ii) the Netherlands or (iii) any other jurisdiction where such a course of
action would either delay the Closing Date for such jurisdiction or would
constitute a criminal offense under applicable Law.

          (g) Each of Purchaser and Seller shall (and shall cause its relevant
Affiliates to) cooperate in connection with the consultation with any works
council in any jurisdiction that requires such consultation.

          SECTION 6.04. Mandatory Assumed Employees. (a) The Purchaser or the
applicable Purchaser Subsidiary shall, in accordance with applicable Law, employ
each Mandatory Business Employee employed by Seller or any Selling Subsidiary on
the Closing Date (each, a "Mandatory Assumed Employee"). In addition, the term
Mandatory Assumed Employee shall include each employee related to the Business
terminated by Seller or a Selling Subsidiary prior to the Closing that Purchaser
or a Purchaser Subsidiary is required to employ after Closing (each, a
"Mandatory Assumed Employee").

          (b) United Kingdom. As soon as reasonably practicable but not later
than 30 days after the Closing Date in the United Kingdom, the Purchaser or the
applicable Purchaser Subsidiary shall terminate the employment of each UK
Mandatory Assumed Employee. The Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser Subsidiary
shall endeavor in good faith to procure that termination of the Mandatory
Assumed Employees will be effected in accordance with applicable Law so as to
minimize the amount of severance or other benefits paid to the Mandatory Assumed
Employees; provided that neither the Purchaser nor any of the Purchaser
Subsidiaries represents or warrants that such terminations will be considered
"fair" or "legitimate" terminations under applicable Law. In particular, but
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser or the
applicable Purchaser Subsidiary shall:

          (i) From the date of this Agreement until Closing, as reasonably
requested by Seller, undertake in good faith to collectively consult with its
employees pursuant to s188 Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act
1992, notwithstanding the fact that the Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser
Subsidiary is not the employer of the UK Mandatory Assumed Employees during the
relevant period. For the avoidance of doubt, as reasonably

                                       50
<page>

requested by Seller with adequate notice to Purchaser, Purchaser or the
Applicable Purchaser Subsidiary shall attend and participate in consultation
meetings with the employee representatives of the UK Mandatory Assumed Employees
and provide the employees' representatives with all reasonable information as to
its intentions with respect to the UK Mandatory Assumed Employees after Closing.

          (ii) From the date of this Agreement until Closing, send such
documentation to the UK Mandatory Assumed Employees as local counsel to
Purchaser advises is necessary or appropriate.

          (iii) From the date of this Agreement until Closing, not send any
documentation (including, without limitation, any letter of termination) to the
UK Mandatory Assumed Employees or make any formal or informal, written or
verbal, communication to the UK Mandatory Assumed Employees without such
documentation or communication having first been approved by Seller (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

          (iv) Be willing and able to enter into compromise agreements (in a
form consistent with the requirements of such agreements by virtue of s203(2)(f)
and s203(3) Employment Rights Act 1996) with the Seller or applicable Seller
Subsidiary and each of the UK Mandatory Assumed Employees in the form that the
Seller requires, whether before, on or after the Closing Date.

          (c) Other European Jurisdictions. With respect to European
jurisdictions other than the United Kingdom, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Closing (after giving effect to any required employee consultations),
the Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser Subsidiary shall terminate the
employment of each Mandatory Assumed Employee. Purchaser or the applicable
Purchaser Subsidiary shall endeavor in good faith to do all things necessary,
both before and after the Closing, to procure such termination of the Mandatory
Assumed Employees in accordance with applicable Law so as to minimize the amount
of severance or other benefits paid to the Mandatory Assumed Employees; provided
that neither the Purchaser nor any of the Purchaser Subsidiaries represents or
warrants that such terminations will be considered "fair" or "legitimate"
terminations under applicable Law. In particular, but without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser
Subsidiary shall:

          (i) From the date of this Agreement until Closing (but only to the
extent consistent with local practice in each jurisdiction for similar
transactions), use its commercially reasonable efforts to collectively consult
with its employees with the Mandatory Assumed Employees, notwithstanding the
fact that the Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser Subsidiary is not the
employer of the Mandatory Assumed Employees during the relevant period.

          (ii) From the date of this Agreement until Closing (but only to the
extent consistent with local practice in each jurisdiction for similar
transactions), send such documentation to the Mandatory Assumed Employees as
local counsel to Purchaser advises is necessary or appropriate.

          (iii) From the date of this Agreement until Closing, not send any
documentation to the Mandatory Assumed Employees or make any formal or informal,
written

                                       51
<page>

or verbal, communication to the Mandatory Assumed Employees without such
documentation or communication having first been approved by the Seller (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

          (d) Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries shall jointly and severally
indemnify and hold Purchaser and the Purchasing Subsidiaries harmless against
any and all costs, expenses, claims or damages associated with or related to the
employment or termination of the Mandatory Assumed Employees, including, but not
limited to, (i) the cost of all salaries, bonuses, incentive payments, benefits,
payroll taxes, perquisites or contributions made to, paid on behalf of, or
related to the Mandatory Assumed Employees, (ii) severance, termination or
pay-in-lieu-of-notice payments made to, or on behalf of, any Mandatory Assumed
Employees, (iii) damages, fines or penalties related to the Mandatory Assumed
Employees (including, but not limited to, any failure to inform or consult),
whether imposed by contract, agreement or Law, (iv) all other expenses incurred
in connection with, or related to, the employment or termination of the
Mandatory Assumed Employees, including, but not limited to, filing fees, travel
expenses and attorney's fees and (v) all costs, fees, damages, settlement or
expenses incurred by Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary in connection with
any action or claim described in this Section 6.04(d); provided that if any
Mandatory Assumed Employee of any jurisdiction has not been terminated prior to
the expiration of the applicable period set forth on Section 6.04(d) of the
Disclosure Schedule the obligations of Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries under
this Section 6.04(d) with respect to such Mandatory Assumed Employee shall
continue after such period only if Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser
Subsidiary is pursuing the termination of such Mandatory Assumed Employees in
good faith in accordance with applicable Law, it being understood that this
proviso shall in no way limit the obligations of Seller or the Selling
Subsidiaries with respect to expenses, costs, damages or losses (regardless of
when incurred) related to Indemnifiable Terminations of Mandatory Assumed
Employees. For this purpose, "Indemnifiable Terminations" means terminations of
Mandatory Assumed Employees by Purchaser or a Purchaser Subsidiary which occur
during the applicable period or while the Purchaser or applicable Purchaser
Subsidiary continues to act in good faith. The parties agree and acknowledge
that the intent and purpose of this Section 6.04(d) is to place the parties in
the economic position they would have occupied if (I) the employment of the
Mandatory Assumed Employees had not transferred to Purchaser or the Purchaser
Subsidiary and (II) Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries had taken the actions
taken by Purchaser and the Purchasing Subsidiaries in connection with the
Mandatory Assumed Employees during the applicable period and after the
applicable period assuming the Purchaser or Purchaser Subsidiary acts in good
faith.

          (e) In the event any Mandatory Assumed Employee brings any action or
claim against the Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary, Purchaser or the
applicable Purchaser Subsidiary shall have the full authority to control, defend
or settle such action or claim; provided that Seller will be kept informed as to
the existence of all material actions taken in respect of such claims and must
consent to any settlement that (i) requires any remedy other than the payment of
money damages or (ii) requires the payment of more than two times a Mandatory
Assumed Employee's annual compensation.

          SECTION 6.05. Additional Benefits Agreements. (a) Section 6.05(a) of
the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a contingent payment for certain Assumed
Employees employed in the United States (a "Benefit Gap Payment"). Prior to the
Closing, Purchaser shall calculate a

                                       52

<page>

Benefit Gap Payment for certain other Assumed Employees (which, in the aggregate
for such Assumed Employees, shall not exceed $3,000,000 minus the aggregate
payments shown on Section 6.05(a) of the Disclosure Schedule) intended to
compensate such Assumed Employees for the difference in value between the
benefits provided to such Assumed Employees prior to Closing by Seller or the
Selling Subsidiaries and the benefits provided to such Assumed Employees after
Closing by Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser Subsidiary. Purchaser shall pay
the applicable Benefit Gap Payment in two equal installments on the six month
anniversary of the Closing Date and the first annual anniversary of the Closing
Date to the relevant Assumed Employees if, and only if, such Assumed Employees
are on the active payroll of the Purchaser or its Affiliates on each such date.

          (b) Purchaser shall provide a retention pool consisting of (i)
US$5,000,000 in cash and (ii) options to purchase 900,000 shares of Purchaser
common stock (the "Retention Options"). Seller shall provide a retention pool of
US$7,500,000 in cash. (Purchaser's retention pool and Seller's retention pool
shall collectively be referred to herein as the "Retention Pool"). The entire
Retention Pool shall be used for the purpose of retaining the services of the
Specified Business Employees through the Closing Date and for a reasonable
period thereafter, and shall be allocated (in the case of cash) and granted (in
the case of Retention Options) as of the Closing Date to the individuals listed
and in the amounts and at the times indicated on Section 6.05(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule. The Retention Options shall be granted by Purchaser as of
the Closing Date to the Assumed Employees listed and in the amounts indicated on
Section 6.05(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, and shall have (A) an exercise price
equal to the fair market value of Purchaser common stock on the Closing Date,
and (B) a vesting schedule pursuant to which not less than 25% of the options
vest on each of the first through the fourth anniversaries of the Closing Date;
provided that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not be required to grant any
Retention Options in violation of applicable Law. No later than 30 days prior to
the date any Assumed Employee's rights to any portion of the Retention Pool
vests (as set forth on Section 6.05(b) of the Disclosure Schedule) (each such
date, a "Vesting Date"), Purchaser shall provide a written notice (the
"Certificate") to Seller certifying the amount of the retention payments owed by
Seller on such Vesting Date as described on Section 6.05(b) of the Disclosure
Schedule. No less than 15 days prior to the applicable Vesting Date, Seller or
the Selling Subsidiaries shall transfer to Purchaser an amount, in readily
available funds, equal to the amount owed by Seller as shown on the Certificate.
As soon as practicable after the applicable Vesting Date, Purchaser shall pay
its portion of the retention payments that vested on the Vesting Date and shall
pay on behalf of Seller Seller's portion of such payments. Purchaser shall
promptly refund to Seller Seller's portion of any retention payments shown on
the Certificate that do not vest on the Vesting Date.

          (c) Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries shall amend, or cause to be
amended, each bonus incentive plan applicable to any Assumed Employee ("Seller's
Bonus Plans") to provide that such Assumed Employee shall continue to be
eligible for any bonus incentive for the bonus cycle in effect on the Closing
(the "Current Bonus Cycle"). As soon as reasonably practicable after the end of
the Current Bonus Cycle, Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries shall determine the
bonus, if any, to be paid to each Assumed Employee under the terms of Seller's
Bonus Plans (the "Final Bonus Payment"). The Purchaser shall reimburse Seller
the Applicable Amount of each Assumed Employee's Final Bonus Payment to the
extent (i) an Assumed Employee's Final Bonus Payment is consistent with bonus
payments made worldwide to similarly situated employees of

                                       53
<page>

Seller or its Affiliates and (ii) Seller has disclosed to Purchaser prior to the
date hereof the aggregate amount of Final Bonus Payments reasonably expected to
be paid. For this purpose, the "Applicable Amount" of each Assumed Employee's
Final Bonus Payment is an amount equal to the product of (X) such Assumed
Employee's Final Bonus Payment and (Y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
total number of days from the Closing Date to December 31, 2001 and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in the Current Bonus Cycle.

          SECTION 6.06. Seller's Additional Indemnity Obligations. In addition
to its other obligations hereunder, the Purchaser shall not be responsible for,
and the Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries shall indemnify and hold the
Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless against, liabilities or claims related to:
(A) any current or former employee of the Seller or any Selling Subsidiary who
is not a Specified Business Employee, (B) Specified Business Employees who
decline the Purchaser's Employment Offer, (C) the termination of employment of
any Specified Business Employee or Assumed Employee by the Seller or any Selling
Subsidiary on the Closing; provided that Purchaser has complied with its
obligation under this Article VI (it being understood that such proviso shall
only be applicable to the extent such non-compliance affects the amount of the
indemnity hereunder) and (D) any event or occurrence with respect to Assumed
Employees that occurred on or before the Closing, except such events or
occurrences that are a result of the acts or omissions of Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates other than any such acts or omissions taken (or not taken) in
compliance with, or pursuant to, this Article VI. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries and their Affiliates shall be
responsible for providing all notifications, payments or benefits required to be
provided under The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1989, as
amended or any similar federal, state or local statute (collectively,
"Notification Statutes") to individuals terminated by the Seller, the Selling
Subsidiaries or their Affiliates on or prior to Closing.

          SECTION 6.07. Purchaser's Additional Indemnity Obligations. Neither
Seller nor any Selling Subsidiary shall be responsible for, and the Purchaser
and its Affiliates shall indemnify and hold Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries
and their Affiliates harmless against severance liabilities or claims for
severance related to: (A) any violation of Section 6.02(b) by Purchaser or the
applicable Purchaser Subsidiary or a failure to continue after Closing to
provide the compensation and benefits specified in Section 6.02(b) for Foreign
Specified Employees; provided that for such liabilities to be eligible for
reimbursement or indemnification hereunder, any such failure or violation must
occur prior to the second anniversary of Closing or (B) the failure of Purchaser
or any applicable Purchaser Subsidiary to provide severance to Assumed Employees
(other than Mandatory Assumed Employees) in accordance with the proviso of
Section 6.02(a)(iii)). In addition, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall pay
Seller and its Affiliates at the Closing $7,000,000 in readily available funds
related to the termination of certain Business Employees. Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall be responsible for providing all notifications, payments or
benefits required to be provided under the Notification Statutes to individuals
terminated by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates after the Closing.

                                  TAX MATTERS

          SECTION 7.01. (a) Except as provided in Section 7.01(b), Seller and
Purchaser shall bear equally any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,
transfer, value added, consumption, goods and services, stock transfer, stamp
duties, and any similar Taxes, duties, registration charges or other like
charges which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (including penalties and interest thereon, other than penalties and
interest described in the last sentence of this Section 7.01(a)) ("Transaction
Taxes"), and the parties shall reasonably cooperate to file such documents and
Tax returns in respect of a Transaction Tax as necessary, including, to the
extent reasonable, as determined by the parties acting in good faith, filing
such applications and documents as shall permit any such Transaction Tax to be
assessed and paid on or prior to the Closing Date in accordance with any
available pre-sale filing procedure. Purchaser shall complete, execute and
provide Seller with an executed copy of the resale or other exemption
certificates with respect to the inventory items sold hereunder to the extent
Seller provides Purchaser with such certificates. Seller and Purchaser, as
required, shall prepare such certificates in a form that meets the legal
requirements of the relevant states, localities or other taxing jurisdictions.
For the avoidance of any doubt, any penalties or interest imposed as a result of
a party's sole negligence in timely and accurately paying any Transaction Taxes
to a relevant taxing jurisdiction shall be borne solely by such party.

          (a) Section 7.01(a) shall not apply to the extent that the Transaction
Tax is refundable ("Refundable Transaction Taxes") to the party legally
responsible for paying such Transaction Tax in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the law of the taxing jurisdiction, in which case such Refundable
Transaction Taxes shall be the sole liability of such legally responsible party;
provided, however, that Section 7.01(a) shall apply to any Refundable
Transaction Tax to the extent such Refundable Transaction Tax is not actually
refunded or refundable within 6 months of the date of payment of such Tax.

          (b) Seller and Purchaser agree to treat all payments made either to or
for the benefit of the other under any indemnity provisions of this Agreement
and for any misrepresentations or breach of warranty or covenants as adjustments
to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and that such treatment shall govern for
purposes hereof. Any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement
shall be (i) increased to take into account any net Tax cost incurred by the
indemnified party arising from the receipt or accrual of indemnity payments
hereunder (grossed-up for such increase) and (ii) reduced to take account of any
net Tax benefit realized by the indemnified party arising from the deductibility
of any indemnified amount.

          (c) Subject to Section 7.01(a) of this Agreement, (i) Seller and the
Selling Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall bear all Taxes of any kind
relating to all Tax periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing
Date (including as a result of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) or any
similar provision under state, foreign or local law) and (ii) Purchaser shall
bear all Taxes relating to the Assets or the conduct or operation of the
Business for all Tax periods or portions thereof beginning after the Closing
Date.

                                       55

          (d) For purposes of this Agreement, any real property, sales, use,
value added, consumption, goods and services, stock transfer, stamp duties, ad
valorem and similar Taxes shall be allocated between portions of a Tax period
that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period") in
the following manner: (i) in the case of a Tax imposed in respect of property
and that applies ratably to a Straddle Period, the amount of Tax allocable to a
portion of the Straddle Period shall be the total amount of such Tax for the
period in question multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
number of days in such portion of such Straddle Period and the denominator of
which is the total number of days in such Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case
of sales, value-added and similar transaction-based Taxes (other than
Transaction Taxes allocated under Section 7.01(a) of this Agreement), shall be
allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period in which the relevant
transaction occurred.

          (e) Seller shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of Taxes
relating to the Assets or the Business for any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall be entitled to
any refunds or credits of Taxes relating to the Assets or the Business for any
taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date.

          (b) by Seller or Purchaser, if the Closing shall not have occurred
prior to April 1, 2002 (the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that the

of the Closing to occur prior to such date;

          (i) Seller shall have no liability under Section 10.02(a) or Section

     aggregate liability that Seller would, but for this Section 10.03(b)(i),
     have under Section 10.02(a) and Section 10.02(b) in connection with such

          (iv) Seller shall have no liability under Section 10.02(a) in respect

          (vi) Seller shall be liable under Section 10.02(a) in respect of

     may be, on commercially reasonable terms (as defined in Section 3.18(g)).

          Section 10.04. Termination of Indemnification. The obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless any party pursuant to Section 10.01 or Section 10.02
shall terminate when the applicable representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement terminates pursuant to Section 11.01; provided, however, that such
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with

                                       60
<page>

respect to any item as to which the person to be indemnified shall have, before
the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a
notice of such claim (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim)
pursuant to Section 10.05 to the party to be providing the indemnification.

          SECTION 10.05. Notification of Claims. (a) A party entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to Section 10.01 or 10.02 (the "Indemnified Party") shall
promptly (and in no event later than 30 days) notify the party liable for such
indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of any third party claim
or demand which the Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give
rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement; provided, however, that
failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure.

          (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to employ counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to assume and defend any such
third party claim or demand asserted against the Indemnified Party at its own
expense; provided that such counsel has no conflict of interest. The Indemnified
Party shall have the right to participate in (but not control) the defense of
any such claim or demand at its own expense. The Indemnifying Party shall notify
the Indemnified Party in writing, as promptly as possible after the date of the
notice of claim given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party under
Section 10.05(a), of its election to defend in good faith any such third party
claim or demand. The Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any such
third party claim or demand without the consent of the Indemnifying Party (not
to be unreasonably withheld) unless the judgment or proposed settlement by its
terms (w) obligates the Indemnified Party to pay the full amount of the
liability in connection with such third party claim, (x) releases the
Indemnifying Party completely in connection with such third party claim, (y)
does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnifying
Party and (z) does not otherwise adversely affect the Indemnifying Party). The
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with and shall make available to the
Indemnifying Party or its agents, all records and other material in the
Indemnified Party's possession reasonably required by it for its use in
contesting any third party claim or demand. The Indemnifying Party shall not
settle or compromise any such third party claim or demand unless the Indemnified
Party consents (which such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), unless
the judgment or proposed settlement by its terms (w) obligates the Indemnifying
Party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with such third
party claim, (x) releases the Indemnified Party completely in connection such
third party claim, (y) does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief
upon the Indemnified Party and (z) does not otherwise adversely affect the
Indemnified Party).

          (c) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party under Section 10.01 or 10.02 that does not involve a third
party claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim with
reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party; provided that such notice shall
not be effective unless it expressly specifies, or it is reasonably apparent
from the document, that it is a notice for indemnification hereunder. Subject to
Section 10.04, the failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability
that it may have to such Indemnified Party under Section 10.01 or 10.02, except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been
prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the
Indemnified Party within fourteen (14) calendar days following its receipt of
such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the
Indemnified Party

                                       61
<page>

under Section 10.01 or 10.02, such claim specified by the Indemnified Party in
such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party
under Section 10.01 or 10.02 and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of
such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the case of any notice
in which the amount of the claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such
later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion thereof) becomes
finally determined.

          SECTION 10.06. Exclusive Remedies. From and after the Closing, the
indemnification provisions of Article X shall be the sole and exclusive remedies
of Seller and Purchaser, respectively, for any breach of the representations and
warranties herein or in any of the Ancillary Agreements (other than the
Preferred Customer Software License Agreement and the Transition Services
Agreement) or the nonperformance of any covenants or agreements herein or in any
of the Ancillary Agreements (other than the Preferred Customer Software License
Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement).

          SECTION 11.13. Arbitration. (a) The parties agree to negotiate in good
faith to resolve any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of, in connection
with, or in relation to the interpretation, performance, non-performance,
validity or breach of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (other than the
Preferred Customer Software License Agreement) or otherwise arising out of, or
in any way related to, this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (other than
the Preferred Customer Software License Agreement), including any claim based on
contract, tort, statute or constitution (a "Dispute"); provided that whether the
parties negotiated in good faith to resolve any Disputes will not be an issue to
be resolved in any forum. In the event the parties are unable to resolve such
Dispute, such Dispute shall be determined by arbitration conducted in English
and the place of such arbitration shall be New York City. Such arbitration shall
be conducted by, and all decisions and awards shall be rendered by, a single
arbitrator (the "Arbitrator") and, except as otherwise provided herein, in
accordance with the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC")
in effect at the time of such arbitration. The Arbitrator shall be jointly
selected by Purchaser and Seller, or, if the parties do not select the
Arbitrator within the ten (10) Business Days of the delivery of a notice by
either party to the other requesing such selection, then the Arbitrator shall be
appointed by the ICC.

          (b) The parties hereto agree that each controversy, dispute or claim
arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements (other than the Preferred Customer Software License Agreement) for
which indemnification is being sought as the sole and exclusive remedy shall be
submitted to the Arbitrator for an initial determination of whether a Loss has
occurred for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement (but not the
amount of such Loss). In the event that the Arbitrator determines that a Loss
has occurred for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement, each of
the parties shall within 20 Business Days (the "Submission Period") after the
Arbitrator issues such determination, submit in writing a dollar amount to the
Arbitrator representing such party's best and final estimate of the amount of
such Loss. The arbitrator shall then determine the amount of such Loss. In
determining the Loss, the Arbitrator shall choose from one of the two dollar
amounts he or she has received from the parties in accordance with the prior
sentence and shall have no discretion to choose another dollar amount. The party
responsible for such Loss, as determined by the Arbitrator, shall pay the dollar
amount so determined by the Arbitrator to the party entitled to such amount, as
determined by the Arbitrator, upon demand by such first party. In the event a
party fails to submit such a dollar amount during the Submission Period, the
Arbitrator shall choose the dollar amount submitted by the party that submitted
a dollar amount.

          (c) All other controversies, disputes and claims, including those
involving non-monetary remedies, whether a dispute is an arbitrable dispute,
whether arbitration has been waived, whether an assignee of this Agreement is
bound to arbitrate, or as to the interpretation or enforceability of this
Section 11.13, shall be determined by the Arbitrator in accordance with the
rules of the ICC.

          (d) Any award rendered by the Arbitrator shall be final, binding and
unappealable except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.ss.1 et
seq., and judgment may be entered on any such award by any state or federal
court having competent jurisdiction.

          (e) The parties intend that the provisions set forth in this Section
11.13 be valid, enforceable and irrevocable. The designation of a situs or a
governing law for this Agreement or

                                       65

the arbitration shall not be deemed an election to preclude application of the
Federal Arbitration Act if it would be applicable. In its award the Arbitrator
shall allocate, in his or her discretion, among the parties to the arbitration
all costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Arbitrator
and reasonable attorney's fees, costs and expert witness expense of the parties.

          (f) Except as set forth in Section 11.13(b), the Arbitrator shall be
entitled, if appropriate, to award any remedy in such proceedings, including
monetary damages, specific performance and all other forms of legal and
equitable relief. The provisions of this Section 11.13 shall not apply to any
arbitration between the parties conducted by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant
to Section 2.04.

          (g) In any arbitration pursuant to this Section 11.13, and before the
Arbitrator establishes the facts of the case, each party shall be entitled to
the timely production by the other party of relevant, non-privileged documents
or copies thereof. If the parties are unable to agree on the scope and/or timing
of such document production, the Arbitrator shall have the power, upon
application of any party, to make all appropriate orders for the production of
documents by any party.

          (h) In any arbitration pursuant to this Section 11.13, and before the
Arbitrator establishes the facts of the case, each party shall be entitled to
examine witnesses by deposition to provide non-privileged testimony that is
relevant to the controversies, claims or disputes at issue. If the parties are
unable to agree on the propriety of a deposition, or its scope and/or timing,
the Arbitrator shall have the power, upon the application of any party, to make
all appropriate orders in connection with a proposed deposition.

          SECTION 11.14. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopier shall
be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

          SECTION 11.15. No Presumption. This Agreement shall be construed
without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or
interpretation against the party drafting or causing any instrument to be
drafted.
