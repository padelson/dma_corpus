receive at the Effective Time an amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B)
the exercise price per share of the Company Common Stock subject to such
Cash-Out Option and (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Cash-Out Option, with the aggregate amount of such payment

Out Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Cash-Out
Option shall be cancelled without payment therefore and have no further force
and effect. At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is unvested,
unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without the need for any further
action on the part of the holder thereof. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Each Company SAR (or portion thereof) that is issued, unexercised and

Effective Time, without the need for any further action on the part of the
holder thereof, and shall be converted into the right to receive at the
Effective Time an amount in cash in U.S. dollars equal to the product of (i)
the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise
price per share of the Company Common Stock subject to such Company SAR or
portion thereof and (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Company SAR or portion thereof, with the aggregate amount of
such payment rounded to the nearest cent (the aggregate amount so payable
referred to as the " _SAR Consideration_ "), less such amounts are required
to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state
or local or foreign tax law with respect to making of such payment. In the
event that the exercise price per share of the Company Common Stock subject
to any Company SAR Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such Company SAR shall be cancelled without payment
therefor and have no further force and effect. At the Effective Time, each
Company SAR that is unvested, unexpired, unexercised and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (and that does not vest as a result
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) shall be cancelled
and extinguished without the need for any further action on the part of the
holder thereof. 

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
in order to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.9, including making
any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee
thereof or any administrator of a Company Incentive Plan as may be necessary,
which actions shall not result in any additional liability to the Company,
including pursuant to Sections 162(m), 280G and 409A of the Code. 

  

Section 2.10 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration are
as follows: 

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, a bank or trust company in
the United States reasonably acceptable to the Company shall be designated by
Parent to act as the Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for payment of the
Merger Consideration, the Option Consideration and the SAR Consideration. 

  

(b) _Deposit with Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit or shall cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, to be held
separate and apart from its other funds, in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock, the Company Stock Options and Company SARs
(other than holders of shares of Company Common Stock cancelled pursuant
to Section 2.6) (each, a " _Holder_ "), cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to
pay (i) the aggregate Merger Consideration which all Holders of Company
Common Stock are entitled to receive pursuant to this Article II, with
instructions and authority to such Paying Agent to pay to each
respective Holder thereof the Merger Consideration upon surrender of their
respective Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as provided herein, and (ii) the
aggregate Option Consideration and SAR Consideration payable pursuant to
Sections 2.9(a) and 2.9(b) to Holders of Company Stock Options and Company
SARs (such cash referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above, the " _Merger Fund_
"), with instructions and authority to such Paying Agent to pay to each
respective Holder of Company Stock Options and Company SARs, as applicable,
in accordance with this Article II. Except as provided in Sections 2.10(c),
2.10(d) and 2.10(e), any such deposit of funds shall be irrevocable. 

  

    ##### 

  

  

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after (and in any event
within three (3) Business Days after) the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail (A) to each Holder of record, as of the Effective
Time, of a Certificate or Certificates or of Book-Entry Shares whose shares
of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares) to the Paying Agent and which shall
be in the form and have such other customary provisions as Parent and the
Company may specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration to be received by the Holder thereof pursuant to this
Agreement, and (B) to each Holder of a Company Stock Option and/or Company
SAR, as applicable, a check in an amount due and payable to such Holder
pursuant to Section 2.9 hereof in respect of such Company Stock Option or
Company SAR; _provided_ that, in lieu of the payments contemplated by this
clause (B), Parent and the Surviving Corporation may direct the Paying Agent
to reimburse the Surviving Corporation (or its designees) for (but only
to the extent of) any amounts actually paid by or on behalf of the Surviving
Corporation to the Holders of Company Stock Options or Company SARs in
respect of the consideration payable therefor. Upon surrender of a
Certificate (or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares the receipt of an
"agents message" by the Paying Agent, or such other evidence of transfer as
the Paying Agent may reasonably request) for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the Holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive promptly in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and
the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith
cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the
benefit of Holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, or for the benefit of Holders of Company Stock Options or Company
SARs on the portion of the Option Consideration or SAR Consideration payable
to such Holder with respect to any Company Stock Options or Company SARs, as
applicable. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore outstanding on the
records of the Company. If Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to
the Company for transfer following the Effective Time, they shall be canceled
against delivery of the Merger Consideration. All cash paid upon surrender of
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article
II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. Until so surrendered, each
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall represent after the Effective
Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a holder of Book-
Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate to the Paying
Agent to receive the consideration to which such Holder is entitled pursuant
to this Article II in respect of such Book-Entry Shares. 

  

    ##### 

  

  

(d) _Termination of Merger Fund_. Any portion of the Merger Fund deposited
with the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.10 and any interest received
with respect thereto that remain undistributed to the Holders of the
Certificates, Book-Entry Shares, Company Stock Options or Company SARs for
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation, upon, and in accordance with, any demand by the
Surviving Corporation therefor, and any holders of Certificates, Book-Entry
Shares, Company Stock Options or Company SARs who have not theretofore
complied with this Section 2.10 shall be entitled to receive only from the
Surviving Corporation payment, as general creditors thereof, of their claim
for Merger Consideration, Option Consideration and SAR Consideration, as the
case may be, to which such Holders may be entitled at such time, without
interest thereon, subject to escheat and abandoned property and similar laws.
The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those
of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Company Common Stock
for the Merger Consideration and the exchange of Company Stock Options and
Company SARs for the Option Consideration and SAR Consideration,
respectively. 

  

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Acquisition Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, any of their respective Affiliates or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration, Option
Consideration or SAR Consideration held in the Merger Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Certificate, Company Stock Option or Company SAR shall not
have been surrendered prior to two (2) years after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any cash in respect of such
Certificate, Company Stock Option or Company SAR would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such
Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate, Company Stock Option or
Company SAR shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

(f) _Investment of Merger Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Merger Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1,000,000,000. Any interest or other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , that any such
investment or any such payment of interest or other income may not delay the
receipt by Holders of any Merger Consideration. If for any reason (including
losses) the cash in the Merger Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all

the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate

the making of such payment under the Code or any provisions of applicable
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
and withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing authority by Parent, the

shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Holder of the Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares or to the Holder of
Company Stock Options or Company SARs, as the case may be, in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent.

by the Holder claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Parent, the posting by such Holder of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim

(a) There are no material actions, suits, litigations, arbitrations,
proceedings or investigations pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or any of
their respective assets or properties, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company,
are there any material and undischarged judgments, orders, injunctions, writs,
awards, settlements or decrees outstanding against the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets or properties. 

  

(b) To the Knowledge of the Company, since September 30, 2010, the Company,
each of its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses have been in
compliance in all material respects with, and not in violation in any
material respect of, any Applicable Law. As of the date hereof, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice from any
Governmental Entity that it has violated or is violating any Applicable Law,
except for alleged violations that have been rectified or resolved or in
respect of which there is no reasonable likelihood of material penalty or
other materially adverse consequence. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has all certificates of authority, franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, approvals and orders of any Governmental Entity necessary for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties or
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the " _Company
Permits_ "), except for those the absence of which have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to interfere materially with the conduct of the
Companys or such Subsidiarys business or to subject the Company or its
Subsidiary to material fines or other material penalties. The Company and
its Subsidiaries are, and since March 31, 2011 have been, in compliance with
the terms of the Company Permits and no suspension or cancellation of any of
the Company Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, except for any such failures to be in compliance that would not
reasonably be expected to interfere materially with the conduct of the
Companys or such Subsidiarys business or to subject the Company or its
Subsidiary to material fines or other material penalties.

Section 3.14 _Intellectual Property_. To the Knowledge of the Company, the
Company or a Subsidiary thereof owns free and clear of all Liens (other than
Permitted Liens) or has the defensible right to use, whether through
ownership, licensing or otherwise, all material Intellectual Property used in
the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Company Intellectual
Property_ ") in each case in the same form and substantially the same manner
as such Company Intellectual Property is used in connection with such
businesses as conducted on the date hereof. As of the date hereof, no
material written claim of invalidity or conflicting ownership rights has been
made or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened by a third party with
respect to any Company Intellectual Property owned by the Company or a
Subsidiary thereof (" _Company-owned Intellectual Property_ ") and no
Company-owned Intellectual Property is the subject of any material pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened action, suit, claim,
investigation, arbitration or other proceeding challenging the Companys
ownership rights in such Company-owned Intellectual Property. Section 3.14(b)
of the Companys Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all material
Company Registered Intellectual Property as of the date hereof and none of
such listed registrations for any Company-owned Intellectual Property have
been cancelled, abandoned or, to the Knowledge of the Company, adjudicated
invalid. Within the three year period prior to the date hereof, no Person has
given written notice to the Company or any Subsidiary thereof that the
conduct of the Companys or its Subsidiarys business is infringing,
violating, or misappropriating, or has materially infringed, violated, or
misappropriated, any third partys domestic or foreign rights in or to any
Intellectual Property in any material respect. To the Knowledge of the
Company, none of the Company-owned Intellectual Property has been or is
currently being infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated by any third
party in any material respect. The Company and each Subsidiary thereof have
taken reasonable measures to safeguard the confidentiality and value of all
Company-owned Intellectual Property comprising material trade secrets or
other confidential information. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and each ancillary agreement by the Company and the
consummation of the Transactions will not in any material respect (x) breach,
violate or conflict with any material instrument or agreement concerning the
Companys or its Subsidiarys use of any Company Intellectual Property, (y)
cause the forfeiture or termination or give rise to a right of forfeiture or
termination of any rights in or to the Company Intellectual Property or (z)
impair the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to (i) use any
Company Intellectual Property and (ii) make, use, sell, license or dispose
of, or to bring any action for the infringement of, any Company-
owned Intellectual Property, all in the same form and manner as the Company
or its Subsidiary has prior to the date hereof. 

  

Section 3.15 _Material Contracts_. None of the Company nor any of its

promulgated by the SEC) except for Contracts that are filed as exhibits to
Company SEC Documents, (ii) limits or otherwise restricts the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries from engaging or competing in any material line of
business or in any geographic area or with any Person, or that requires
referrals of business or provides for priority or exclusive status for any
Person, (iii) would be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation
S-K promulgated by the SEC, (iv) relates to the formation, creation,
operation, management or control of any partnership or joint venture, (v)

services valued at £100,000 or more per annum, or requires payments or
consideration at or above such levels in 2011, or (viii) that would
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each
Contract of the type described in the first sentence of this Section 3.15 is
referred to herein as a " _Company Material Contract_." Subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equitable Remedies Exception, each Company Material Contract
is a valid and binding obligation of the Company (or, if a Subsidiary of the
Company is a party, such Subsidiary) and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
the other parties thereto, and is in full force and effect, and the Company
and each Subsidiary thereof __ have performed all obligations required to be
performed by them to date under each Company Material Contract to which they
are a party, except where the Companys or its Subsidiarys noncompliance or
nonperformance has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of or default
under (nor does there exist any condition which with the passage of time or
the giving of notice (or both) would cause such a violation of or default
under) or has Knowledge of, or has received notice of, any violation of or
default under (or any condition which with the passage of time or the giving
of notice (or both) would cause such a violation of or default under) any
Company Material Contract, except for those violations or defaults that have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.16 _Insurance_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries maintains
insurance policies with reputable insurance carriers against risks of a
character and in such amounts as are usually insured against by similarly
situated companies in the same or similar businesses, all of which are in
full force and effect and, to the Companys Knowledge, are valid and
enforceable in accordance with their terms. Section 3.16 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list of all material
insurance policies in force on the date hereof with respect to the business

comparable contract rights in and to, all properties and other assets which
are, individually or in the aggregate, material to the business or financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, free
and clear of all Liens (except for Permitted Liens) and (b) have complied in
all material respects with the terms of each lease of property that is
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except for
defects in title or failure to comply, have not had and would not reasonably
be excepted to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Such leases are in full force and effect (except for any
scheduled expirations after the date hereof in accordance with the terms of
such leases) and, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equitable Remedies Exception,
are enforceable in accordance with their respective terms against the Company
or its Subsidiary party thereto and, to the Knowledge of the Company, the
other parties thereto, and as of the date hereof neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received or provided any written notice of any event
or occurrence that has resulted or would reasonably be expected to result
(with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time or both) in a
material default with respect to any such lease. 

  

    ##### 

  

  

Section 3.18 _Labor and Employment_. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with all Applicable Laws respecting
employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment
(including termination of employment), wages, hours of work, occupational
safety and health, and worker classification, and are not engaged in any
unfair labor practices, except for such violations which could
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of
the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received written notice from any Governmental Entity of an alleged or
actual violation of any such labor or employment laws, or of the intent of
any Governmental Entity to conduct an investigation with respect to or
relating to any such matters and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no such
investigation is in progress. Since September 30, 2010, no strikes, work
stoppages, slowdowns, lockouts, material arbitrations or material grievances,
or other material labor disputes have occurred or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened in writing, involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any collective bargaining agreements, and there are not, to the Knowledge of
the Company, any union organizing activities concerning any employees of the
Company. 

  

Section 3.19 _Opinion of Financial Advisors_. The Company Board has received
the oral opinion of Oppenheimer and Co. Inc. to the effect that, as of the date
of such opinion and subject to the various assumptions and qualifications
therein, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to
the holders of Company Common Stock and the Company will promptly provide a
written copy of such opinion to Parent solely for information purposes
following receipt thereof by the Company. It is agreed and understood that
such opinion is for the benefit of the Company Board and may not be relied on
by Parent or Acquisition Sub. 

  

Section 3.20 _Brokers_. Except for Oppenheimer and Co. Inc., whose fees and
expenses shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the
Companys agreement with such firm, which agreement has been previously
disclosed to Parent, no agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor

action, agreement or commitment of the Company or any of its Affiliates, to
any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or
commission in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 

  

Section 3.21 _State Takeover Statutes_. Subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Acquisition Sub set forth in
Section 4.6, the Company Board has, to the extent such statutes are
applicable, taken all action (including appropriate approvals of the Company
Board) necessary to render the business combination provisions of the NYBCL
inapplicable to the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. No other "fair price", "moratorium", "control share acquisition",
"business combination" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation
enacted under state or federal laws in the United States or similar
charter or bylaw provisions are applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

Section 3.22 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, including any
modification or qualification thereto included in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries or any other Person
on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries makes any other express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company, any of the
Companys Subsidiaries or any information provided to Parent or Acquisition
Sub with respect to the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
 OF PARENT AND ACQUISITION SUB 

   

Except (i) as set forth in the corresponding section of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, it being understood that matters disclosed pursuant to one section
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed with respect to
any other section of the Parent Disclosure Schedule where it is reasonably
apparent that the matters so disclosed are applicable to such other sections,
and (ii) for events or matters expressly contemplated or permitted under this
Agreement or any agreement contemplated hereby or thereby, each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub (each, an " _Acquiror Entity_ ") hereby jointly and severally
represents and warrants to the Company as follows: 

  

Section 4.1 _Organization_. Each Acquiror Entity is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize that concept) under the laws of its jurisdiction
of incorporation and has the requisite power and authority to carry on its
business as now being conducted. Each Acquiror Entity is duly qualified to
do business (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept) and
is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that
concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except where any failure to be so duly qualified,
licensed and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
that concept) has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, an Acquiror Entity Material Adverse
Effect. 

  

Section 4.2 _Authorization_. Each Acquiror Entity has the requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each
Acquiror Entity and the performance of its obligations hereunder have been
duly and validly authorized, and this Agreement has been approved and adopted
by the Board of Directors of each Acquiror Entity, and no other corporate
proceedings (such as approval by the stockholders or holders of any other
securities of Parent) on the part of either Acquiror Entity are necessary to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement.
Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent, as the sole
stockholder of Acquisition Sub (either directly or indirectly through one or
more wholly-owned Subsidiaries), is approving this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by each Acquiror Entity and, assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each Acquiror Entity,
enforceable against each Acquiror Entity in accordance with its terms,
subject to the Bankruptcy and Equitable Remedies Exception. 

  

    ##### 

  

  

Section 4.3 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by each Acquiror Entity do not, and except for
those filings, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals as may be
required under, and other applicable requirements of, the Exchange Act, the
NYBCL, state blue sky, securities or takeover laws, stock exchange and Nasdaq
Stock Market requirements and the Irish Competition Act 2002, the performance
of this Agreement by each Acquiror Entity and the consummation by each
Acquiror Entity of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (i) conflict
with or result in a breach of any provision of the charter or bylaws (or
equivalent documents in the relevant jurisdiction) of such Acquiror Entity,
(ii) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due
notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right
of termination, vesting, amendment, cancellation or acceleration or impose on
either of the Acquiror Entities any obligation to repurchase, repay, redeem
or acquire or any similar right or obligation) under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any Contract to which any Acquiror Entity is
a party or by which it or its assets is bound, (iii) require any filing or
registration with, or permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any
Governmental Entity on the part of either Acquiror Entity or (iv) violate any
Applicable Law to which such Acquiror Entity or any of its properties or
assets is subject, excluding from the foregoing clauses (ii)  (iv) such
conflicts, requirements, defaults, failures, breaches, rights or violations
that have not had and would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to have an Acquiror Entity Material Adverse Effect. 

  

Section 4.4 _Proxy Statement_. None of the information relating to the
Acquiror Entities and supplied or to be supplied by either Acquiror Entity or
its respective Affiliates specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement,
at the time of its mailing to the Companys stockholders and at the time of
the Special Meeting, will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. No representation is made by any Acquiror Entity with respect to
statements made in the Proxy Statement, or otherwise, based upon information
not supplied by an Acquiror Entity, including any information supplied by the
Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates. 

  

Section 4.5 _Capitalization; Operations_. All of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Acquisition Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned
by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, free and
clear of all Liens. Acquisition Sub was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has not and,
prior to the Effective Time will not have, other than in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and other than those
incidental to its organization and maintenance of corporate existence, (i)
engaged in any business activities, (ii) conducted any operations, (iii)
incurred any liabilities or (iv) owned any assets or property. 

  

Section 4.6 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. Neither Acquiror Entity nor
any of its respective "affiliates" or "associates" is the "beneficial owner"
of any shares of Company Common Stock or any securities convertible into,
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock, or is an
"interested shareholder" of the Company (as such quoted terms are defined
in Section 912 of the NYBCL). There are no voting trusts or other agreements
or understandings to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with
respect to the voting of the capital stock or other equity interests of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

Section 4.7 _Financing_. Parent and Acquisition Sub will have on the Closing
Date, sufficient funds available to them in cash or under existing credit
lines to finance the payment of the Merger Consideration and the Option
Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement and to otherwise perform
their obligations hereunder.

Section 4.8 _Brokers_. Except for Credit Suisse, whose fees and expenses shall
be paid by Parent, no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled as a
result of any action, agreement or commitment of the Acquiror Entities, to
any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or
commission in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. 

  

Section 4.9 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent or Acquisition Sub, threatened against either Acquiror Entity, at law
or in equity, that has had or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, an Acquiror Entity Material Adverse
Effect. 

  

Section 4.10 _Absence of Arrangements with Management_. Other than this
Agreement, as of the date hereof, there are no contracts, undertakings,
commitments, agreements or obligations or understandings between Parent or
Acquisition Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and
any member of the Companys management or the Company Board on the other hand,
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operations
of the Company after the Effective Time. 

  

Section 4.11 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, neither Parent
nor Acquisition Sub nor any other Person on its behalf makes any other
express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or
Acquisition Sub or any information provided to the Company or any of its

Section 5.1, except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement. 

   

Section 5.2 _Stockholders  Meeting; Proxy Material_. 

  

(a) As promptly as is reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare a preliminary proxy statement relating
to the approval of the Merger by the Companys stockholders (as amended or
supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ "), which shall, subject to Section
5.2(d), include the Company Recommendation. The Company shall provide Parent
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such draft, and once
such draft is in a form reasonably acceptable to each of Parent and the
Company, the Company shall file the Company Proxy Statement with the SEC.
Parent and Acquisition Sub will timely supply the Company with such Acquiror
Entity Information as is required or desirable to be included in the Proxy
Statement, it being understood that the Company will not include any Acquiror
Entity Information not supplied or approved by Parent (which approval will
not be unreasonably withhold or delayed). The Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC
as promptly as practicable after such filing. 

  

(b) The Company shall as promptly as is reasonably practicable notify Parent
and Acquisition Sub of the receipt of any oral or written comments from the
SEC relating to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall cooperate and provide
Parent and Acquisition Sub with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on each amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement and all
responses to requests for additional information by and replies to comments
of the SEC, prior to filing such with or sending such to the SEC, and the
parties hereto will provide each other with copies of all such filings made
and correspondence with the SEC. The Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after the date the SEC
staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may
commence mailing the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time, any information should be discovered by any party which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy
Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto and, to the extent required by Applicable Law, an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed by
the Company with the SEC and disseminated by the Company to the stockholders
of the Company. 

  

    ##### 

  

  

(c) Following the clearance of the Proxy Statement with the SEC, and subject
to the other provisions of this Agreement (including Section 5.2(d)), the
Company, acting through the Company Board and in accordance with Applicable
Law, the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Company Bylaws and the
rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of
its stockholders (the " _Special Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof for the purpose of considering and taking action upon this
Agreement and the Merger and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit proxies in favor of approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , for the
avoidance of doubt, the Company may postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting:
(i) with the consent of Parent, (ii) for the absence of a quorum, (iii) to
allow reasonable additional time for the filing and distribution of
any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company Board has determined
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is
necessary under Applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed by the Companys
stockholders prior to the Company Meeting, or (iv) if the Company has
provided a Notice of Superior Proposal contemplated by Section 5.2(d)(C)(ii),
during the five Business Day period contemplated thereby. 

  

(d) Except as provided in this Section 5.2(d), the Company Board shall neither
withdraw, modify or change, nor resolve to withdraw, modify or change, in any
manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, the Company Recommendation, nor
take any other action or make any other public statement in connection with
the Special Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation (any of
the foregoing, a " _Change in Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
Board may determine (i) to effect a Change in Recommendation and (ii) not to
solicit proxies in favor of approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, if __ (A) the Company has complied
in all material respects with its obligations under Section 5.4, (B) the
Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
independent outside legal and financial advisors, that failure to take such
action would result in a violation of its fiduciary responsibilities to
the Companys stockholders under Applicable Law and (C) if the Company Board
intends to effect a Change in Recommendation following and as a result of an
Acquisition Proposal, (i) the Company Board has concluded in good faith that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company
Board has provided five Business Days prior written notice (a " _Notice of
Superior Proposal_ ") advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take
such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action
by the Company Board (it being understood and agreed that any amendment
to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal
shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new five Business Day
period), (iii) during such five Business Day period, if requested by Parent,
the Company has engaged in and has caused its legal and financial advisors to
engage in good faith negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent desires
to negotiate) to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the Acquisition
Proposal which was determined to constitute a Superior Proposal is no longer
a Superior Proposal and (iv) at the end of such five Business Day period,
such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn and continues to constitute
a Superior Proposal (taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a Notice of Superior Proposal, as
a result of the negotiations required by clause (iii) or otherwise). 

  

    ##### 

  

  

Section 5.3 _Access to Information; Control_. Between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company shall (a) give Parent,
Acquisition Sub, and its and their respective counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized representatives (collectively, " _Acquiror s
Representatives_") reasonable access during normal business hours to
the offices, properties, Contracts, books and records (including Tax Returns
and other Tax-related information) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (b)
furnish to Acquirors Representatives such financial and operating data and
other information (including Tax Returns and other Tax-related information)
relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective operations as
such Persons may reasonably request and (c) instruct the employees, counsel
and financial advisors of the Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate with
Parent and Acquisition Sub in their investigation of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such access
shall only be provided to the extent that such access would not violate
Applicable Laws. Prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries made available pursuant to this Section 5.3,
shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. Prior to
the Effective Time, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall, and Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall cause each of the Acquirors Representatives not
to, use any information acquired pursuant to this Section 5.3 for any purpose
unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. 

   

Section 5.4 _No Solicitation_. 

  

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier,
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or
officers shall (whether directly or indirectly through officers, directors,
employees, Affiliates, advisors, representatives, agents or other
intermediaries), and the Company shall direct and use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries respective officers, directors,
employees, Affiliates, advisors, representatives or other agents of the
Company not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly
encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public
information) any inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal or
transaction that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into,
participate and/or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any
non-public information or data relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or
afford access to the properties, books or records of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to, any Person relating to, or who has made or disclosed to the
Company that it is contemplating making, an Acquisition Proposal or (iii)
accept or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement,
letter of intent or agreement in principle (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement to the extent expressly provided in the following
sentence), providing for or relating to an Acquisition Proposal or enter into
any agreement, letter of intent or agreement in principle requiring the
Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions
contemplated 

  

    ##### 

  

   

hereby, (iv) waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any
contractual "standstill" or similar obligation of any Person other than
Parent (except for any portion of any such standstill or similar obligation
that restricts the ability of a person to communicate an Acquisition Proposal
to the Company Board) or (v) agree or publicly propose to do any of the
foregoing. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if at any time prior to the
adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders at the
Special Meeting, (x) the Company complies with Section 5.4(b) but receives an
Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party and (y) the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its independent outside legal and
financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the Company may take any of
the actions described in clause (ii) of the previous sentence to the extent
that the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
independent outside legal and financial advisors, that failure to take such
actions would result in a violation of its fiduciary responsibilities to
the Companys stockholders under Applicable Law; _provided_ , that following
receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, the Company and its representatives may
contact the party submitting such Acquisition Proposal in order to clarify
and understand the terms and conditions of such proposal so as to determine
whether such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would possibly be likely
to lead to a Superior Proposal or to direct such Person to this Agreement;
_provided_   _further_ that the Company (A) will promptly, and in any event
within two (2) Business Days, provide notice to Parent of any determination
to take any such action, (B) will not disclose any information to such Person
without entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with
such Person and (C) will promptly provide to Parent and Acquisition Sub any
non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
provided to such other Person which was not previously provided to Parent and
Acquisition Sub. 

  

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person and any other activities conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and, subject to the other provisions of this Section
5.4, will use its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce any
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party (except for any portion of any such
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement that restricts the ability
of a person to communicate an Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board),
including by requesting the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished. Without limiting the Companys obligations
under Section 5.4(a), the Company will promptly (within one Business Day)
following the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal advise Parent of the
substance thereof (including the identity of the Person making, and the terms
and conditions of, such Acquisition Proposal) and will keep Parent apprised
of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis
(and in any event with 48 hours of the occurrence of such developments,
discussions or negotiations). 

  

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement, including in this Section 5.4, shall
prohibit the Company or the Company Board, directly or indirectly through
advisors, agents or other intermediaries, from (i) taking and disclosing to
its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing
a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position
thereunder, or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under Applicable Law or would
constitute a violation of Applicable Law. It is understood and agreed that,
for purposes of this Agreement (including Article VII), a factually accurate
public statement by the Company that describes the Companys receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with
respect thereto, or any "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company
Board, shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation or an approval or
recommendation with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Section 5.5 _Director and Officer Liability_. 

  

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor
all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liability for acts and
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancements of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of
the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in their capacity as such (the " _Indemnitees_ ") as provided
in their respective charters (or similar constitutive documents) or bylaws,
by all Applicable Laws, or in any indemnification agreement set forth
in Section 5.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and all such rights shall
survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
Indemnitees, unless an alteration or modification of such documents is
required by Applicable Law or any Indemnitee affected thereby otherwise
consents in writing thereto. 

  

(b) In furtherance of, and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company
shall indemnify and hold harmless, and after the Effective Time Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless, each
Indemnitee as and to the extent provided in Section 8.2 of the Companys
Amended and Restated By-laws, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, as
if such Section 8.2 were restated herein, _mutatis mutandis_. 

  

(c) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain in effect officers and directors liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time committed by directors or officers of the Company in their
capacity as such, covering each director and officer of the Company serving
as such immediately prior to the Effective Time and covered immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the Companys officers and directors liability
insurance policy maintained by the Company and in effect as of the date
hereof, on terms with respect to coverage and amount not materially
less favorable in the aggregate than those of the policy in effect on the
date hereof, so long as the Surviving Corporation is not required to pay an
annual premium in excess of 300% of the last annual payment paid by the
Company for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (the
"Maximum Premium"). If the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the
insurance described in the prior sentence for an amount less than or equal to
the Maximum Premium, it shall instead obtain as much comparable insurance as
possible for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. At the Companys
option, the Company may purchase at or prior to the Effective Time, a six-year
"tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent
benefits as the current policies of officers and directors liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective
Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , that the premium for any such "tail" policy shall
not be in excess of 300% of the last annual payment made by the Company for
such insurance prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to
be obtained pursuant hereto. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained
by the Company prior to the Effective Time, it shall be deemed to satisfy all
obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 5.5(c) and Parent
shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its
full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase
or pay for insurance hereunder. 

  

    ##### 

  

  

(d) This Section 5.5 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
Indemnitees referred to herein, their heirs and personal representatives and
shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its successors
and assigns. 

  

(e) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person or (iii) dissolves or liquidates, then, and in each case,
to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or the transferee of its
assets upon dissolution or liquidation shall assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 5.5. In addition, the Surviving Corporation shall
not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any assets in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Corporation or its
successor unable to satisfy its obligations hereunder. 

   

Section 5.6 _Certain Filings_. 

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company shall, and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable after the
date hereof. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one another (i)
in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or
waivers are required to be obtained from any non-governmental Third Parties
to any Company Material Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) in seeking any such
actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking timely to
obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company and the Parent shall make such filings with
the Competition Authority as may be required under the Irish Competition Act
2002. Subject to Section 5.6(c), each party will use its reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions necessary, including to
comply promptly and fully with any requests for information from Governmental
Entities, to obtain any clearance, waiver, approval or authorization that is
necessary to enable the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby as soon as practicable after the date hereof. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Subject to Section 5.6(c), (i) the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall each use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if
any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
under any Regulatory Law and (ii) if any administrative, judicial or
legislative action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party,
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall each
cooperate with the other parties and use its respective reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect
and that restricts, prevents or prohibits consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including by pursuing all reasonable avenues
of administrative and judicial appeal. For purposes of Section 5.6(a) and
clause (i) of this Section 5.6(b), "reasonable best efforts" in relation to
any approvals or consents required under the Irish Competition Act 2002 shall
include agreeing to such undertakings, agreements, divestitures or
other actions as are reasonably requested by the Competition Authority or
that are required to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding under the Irish Competition Act 2002 that would otherwise have
the effect of preventing the Closing or delaying the Closing beyond the
outside date specified in the proviso to Section 7.1(b), or to obtain the
consent, clearance, waiver or authorization of the Competition Authority
without which the Closing would be prevented or delayed beyond the
outside date specified in the _proviso_ to Section 7.1(b); _provided,_ that
such undertakings, agreements, divestitures and/or other actions would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. 

  

(c) Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall (i) subject to any
restrictions under any Applicable Law, to the extent practicable, promptly
notify each other of any communication to that party from any Governmental
Entity (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice and the Competition Authority) with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions and other agreements contemplated hereby, (ii)
subject to any restrictions under any Applicable Law, use reasonable best
efforts to consult with the other party in advance of any meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions and other agreements
contemplated hereby, (iii) subject to any restrictions under any Applicable
Law, furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) received
by it, its Affiliates and their respective representatives from any
Governmental Entity or members of its staff with respect to this Agreement
and the transactions and other agreements contemplated hereby (excluding
documents and communications which are subject to preexisting confidentiality
agreements and to the attorney client privilege or work product doctrine) and
(iv) furnish the other party with such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as such other party and its Affiliates may reasonably
request in connection with their preparation of necessary filings,
registrations, or submissions of information to any Governmental Entities in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions and other agreements
contemplated hereby and thereby, including any filings necessary or
appropriate under the provisions of any Regulatory Law.

(d) _Third Party Consents_. Between the date hereof and the Effective Time,
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the third
party consents set forth in Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

Section 5.7 _Public Announcements_. None of the Company, Parent, Acquisition
Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates shall issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
approval of the other parties, except to the extent required, based upon
the advice of outside counsel, by Applicable Law or by any listing agreement
with, or the rules and regulations of, the Nasdaq Stock Market and after such
prior notice to the other parties hereto as is practicable under the
circumstances. 

  

Section 5.8 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "business combination"
or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation
is or may become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, the
Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take
such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such
statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

Section 5.9 _Certain Notifications_. Between the date hereof and the Effective
Time, the Company shall promptly notify Parent and Acquisition Sub of (i) any
notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, if the failure to obtain such consent would reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any notice or
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) any action, suit, charge,
complaint, grievance or proceeding commenced or, to the Companys
Knowledge, threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary which, if pending
on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been
disclosed pursuant to Section 3.13 or which relates to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly notify the Company
of any action, suit, charge, complaint, grievance or proceeding commenced or,
to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or Acquisition Sub
which, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
have been disclosed pursuant to Section 4.9 or which relates to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Between the date hereof
and the Effective Time, each party shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto in writing after becoming aware of the occurrence of any event which
will, or is reasonably likely to, result in the failure to satisfy any of
the conditions specified in Article VI. 

   

Section 5.10 _Employees and Employee Benefit Plans_. 

  

(a) For a period of not less than one year following the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall provide, or cause to be provided to, all
individuals who are employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries (including
employees who are not actively at work on account of illness, disability or
leave of absence) on the Closing Date (the " _Affected Employees_
") compensation, salary, wages, cash incentive opportunities, severance,
medical, retirement and other employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements (excluding equity- based compensation) that are comparable, in
the aggregate, to the compensation, salary, wages, cash incentive
opportunities, severance, medical, retirement and other written employee
benefit plans, programs and arrangements (excluding equity-based
compensation) provided to such Affected Employees immediately prior to the
Closing, as such plans, programs and arrangements are disclosed to the Parent
pursuant to Section 3.11. Parent acknowledges that a "change of control" (or
similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company Incentive Plans and the
Company Plans, as applicable, will occur at or prior to the Effective Time,
as applicable. 

  

    ##### 

  

  

(b) If and to the extent that Affected Employees are after the Closing Date
transferred to the Parent or Subsidiaries of the Parent other than the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, the Parent will give or cause its
relevant Subsidiary to give the Affected Employees full credit for purposes
of eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accrual (other than benefit
accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) under the employee benefit
plans and arrangements maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in
which such Affected Employees participate for such Affected Employees
service with the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or any of
their respective predecessors (to the extent such service was credited under
the analogous predecessor plan), except to the extent such credit would
result in an unintended duplication of benefits.

parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person
(including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former

its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries), other than
the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters
provided for in this Section 5.10) under or by reason of any provision of
this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall affect
the right of Parent (or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
or its Subsidiaries) to terminate the employment of its employees,
including any Affected Employee. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
to grant any employee a right to continued employment by the Parent, the
Company, Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries.
Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or implied, shall constitute an
amendment to any Company Plan.

earlier termination of this Agreement, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall not,
and shall not permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take or agree

cured (or is not capable of being cured) within twenty (20) Business Days
following receipt by Parent or Acquisition Sub, as the case may be, of

    ##### 

  

  

(h) by Parent, _provided_ that neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub is then in

Article VII, Article VIII and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and remain enforceable thereafter, and (ii)
subject to Section 7.3, nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any party
or parties hereto, as applicable, from liability for any breach of this
Agreement prior to its termination. 

   

Section 7.3 _Fees and Expenses_. 

  

(a) The Company agrees to pay Parent the sum of $5,200,000 (the " _Termination
Fee_ ") if (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(e), or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(f), such payment to be made concurrently with the termination of
this Agreement by the Company in the case of clause (i), or within three
(3) Business Days after termination of this Agreement by Parent in the case
of clause (ii). 

  

(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent (x)
pursuant to Section 7.1(b) without a vote of the stockholders of the Company
with respect to the adoption of this Agreement at the Special Meeting having

such termination, a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal was publicly

as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom in respect of
applicable Taxes. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather
represents liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent and Acquisition Sub for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
event that the Termination Fee is paid as a result of a termination of this
Agreement, Parents right to receive payment of the Termination Fee pursuant
to this Section 7.3 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their respective Affiliates, if applicable for (A) the
loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated and
(B) any other losses, damages, obligations or liabilities suffered as a
result of or under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and upon payment of the Termination Fee in accordance with this
Section 7.3, none of the Company or any of its respective stockholders,
directors, officers, agents or Affiliates, as the case may be, shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

(e) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.3, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses.

words "without limitation," (ii) the word "or" is not exclusive and (iii) the
words "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" refer to this
Agreement as a whole. Unless the context otherwise requires, a
reference herein: (i) to an Article or Section means an Article and Section

such agreement, instrument or other document as amended, supplemented and
modified from time to time to the extent permitted by the provisions thereof

Section 8.5 _Amendments, Modification and Waiver_. 

  

(a) Except as may otherwise be provided herein, any provision of this
Agreement may be amended, modified or waived by the parties hereto, by action
taken by or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, prior to the
Closing Date if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company, Parent and Acquisition
Sub or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to
be effective;  _provided_ , that no such amendment, modification or waiver by
the Company shall be effective unless it is authorized by the Company Board;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that, after the Company Stockholder Approval has
been obtained, there shall not be made any amendment that by Applicable Law
requires further approval by the Companys stockholders without first
obtaining such further approval. 

  

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law or in equity. 

  

Section 8.6 _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns;  _provided_ , that none of the Company,
Parent or Acquisition Sub may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part (whether
by operation of law or otherwise), without the consent of the other parties
hereto and, in the case of the Company, the Company Board. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Acquisition Sub may assign any of its rights
hereunder to any Subsidiary of Parent and Parent may assign its rights
hereunder to any affiliate of Parent; provided that, such assignment shall
not relieve Acquisition Sub or Parent of their obligations hereunder without
the prior written consent of the Company. 

  

Section 8.7 _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and agree that any
breach of the terms of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm for
which money damages would not be an adequate remedy and accordingly the
parties agree that, in addition to any other remedies, each party shall be
entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement by a decree of specific
performance without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages
as a remedy and without the need for posting a bond or other security. 

   

Section 8.8 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by
Jury_. 

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York (regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court of the State of New York or any federal court, in each case, sitting in
the borough of Manhattan in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or
proceeding except in such court, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such court,
(iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such action or proceeding in such court and (iv) waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum
to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in such court. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law. Each party to
this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for notices in Section 8.2. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect
the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner
permitted by Applicable Law. 

  

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
8.7(c). 

  

Section 8.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated herein are not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as originally contemplated
to the fullest extent possible. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 8.10 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 5.5,
this Agreement is solely for the benefit of the Company and its successors
and permitted assigns, with respect to the obligations of Parent and
Acquisition Sub under this Agreement, and for the benefit of Parent and
Acquisition Sub and their respective successors and permitted assigns,
with respect to the obligations of the Company under this Agreement, and this
Agreement shall not be deemed to confer upon or give to any other third party
any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right.
The Indemnitees referred to in Section 5.5 shall be third party beneficiaries
entitled to enforce the provisions of Section 5.5 of this Agreement. 

  

Section 8.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including any exhibits or
schedules hereto, and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all other prior agreements or understandings, both written and
oral, between the parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter
hereof. 

  

Section 8.12 _Counterparts; Fax Signatures; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may
be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. Each of the parties hereto (i) has agreed to permit
the use, from time to time and where appropriate, of faxed signatures in
order to expedite the Closing, (ii) intends to be bound by its respective
faxed signature, (iii) is aware that the other parties hereto will rely on
the faxed signature and (iv) acknowledges such reliance and waives any
defenses to the enforcement of the documents effecting the transactions
contemplated hereby contemplated by this Agreement based on the fact that
a signature was sent by fax. This Agreement shall become effective when each
party hereto shall have received counterparts hereof signed by all of the
other parties hereto.
