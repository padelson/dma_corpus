be correspondingly adjusted to provide to the GP Sellers the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 



 

(e) _Fractional New Common Units_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, any GP Seller who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a New Common Unit pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ will receive from
Parent, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Average Closing Price
as of the Closing Date and (ii) the fraction of a New Common Unit that such
holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_,
which amount of cash, if any, shall be paid to the appropriate GP Seller at
Closing, subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(f) _Tax Characterization of GP Purchase_. The GP Sellers and Parent each
acknowledges and agrees that for federal income Tax purposes the GP Purchase
will be treated as an "assets-over" partnership merger transaction under
Treasury Regulations Sections 1.708-1(c)(1) and 1.708-1(c)(3)(i), whereby
Partnership GP will be the terminating partnership and Parent will be the
resulting partnership. As a result, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes the
GP Purchase will be treated as a contribution of all of the assets of
Partnership GP to Parent in exchange for the GP Purchase Price, the cash
received in lieu of fractional Parent Common Units and the assumption of
liabilities. To the maximum extent possible, any cash received in lieu of
fractional Parent Common Units and other cash deemed received in exchange for
Partnership GPs assets shall be treated as a reimbursement of preformation
capital expenditures described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-4(d). To
the extent any cash received in lieu of fractional Parent Common Units and
other cash deemed received in exchange for Partnership GPs assets exceeds the
amount that can be so treated, such excess cash will be treated as proceeds of
a Disguised Sale. Each of the GP Sellers and Parent agrees to prepare and
file all U.S. federal income Tax Returns in accordance with the foregoing and
shall not take any position inconsistent therewith on any such Tax Return, or
in the course of any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
U.S. federal income Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws
following a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
final administrative decision by an applicable Governmental Authority.

(a) _The Merger and Surviving Entity_. Upon the terms and subject to the

The Merger will have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the

unchanged and will be the agreement of limited partnership of the Surviving
Entity until duly amended in accordance with the terms thereof and applicable
Law.

 



 

(d) _Admission as Partner_. At the Effective Time, (i) ** ** by virtue of the
Merger, and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Partnership, the Partnership GP or any holder of Parent Securities or
Partnership Common Units, Parent shall be admitted as the sole limited partner

(the " ** _Closing_** ") will occur on (a) the third Business Day after the
day on which the last of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_

or (b) such other date to which Parent and the Partnership may agree in

 **ARTICLE III 
MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES**

 



 

 **3.1** ** ****_Merger Consideration_**. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Partnership, Partnership GP, or
any holder of Parent securities or Partnership Common Units:

 



 

(a) All of the limited liability company interests in Merger Sub outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically converted into
1,000 Partnership Common Units.

 



 

(b) The general partner interest in the Partnership issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain outstanding in the
Surviving Entity in the form set forth in the Existing Partnership Agreement,
and Partnership GP, as the holder of such general partner interest, will
continue as the sole general partner of the Surviving Entity as set forth in
the Existing Partnership Agreement. At the Effective Time, the books and
records of the Partnership will be revised to reflect that all limited
partners of the Partnership immediately prior to the Effective Time cease to
be limited partners of the Partnership pursuant to the terms of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement and that Parent is the sole limited partner of the Partnership, and
the Partnership will continue without dissolution.

 



 

(c) Each Partnership Common Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (excluding any Excluded Units) will be converted into the
right to receive 0.550 Parent Common Units (the " ** _Merger Consideration_**
," and such ratio, the " ** _Exchange Ratio_** "), which Parent Common Units
will be duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid in accordance with
applicable Laws and the Parent Agreement, as applicable (such Parent Common
Units described in this clause (c) and the Parent Common Units issued to the
GP Sellers as the GP Purchase Price are referred to collectively herein as the
" ** _New Common Units_** ," and the issuance of the New Common Units as part
of the Merger Consideration and GP Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement
is referred to herein as the " ** _New Common Unit Issuance_** ").

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, each Partnership Common Unit (if any) owned immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the Partnership or its wholly owned Subsidiaries or
by Parent or its wholly owned Subsidiaries (collectively, the " ** _Excluded
Units_** ") will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist and no
consideration will be received therefor.

 



 

 **3.2** ** ****_Rights As Unitholders; Unit Transfers_**. All Partnership
Common Units converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ will cease to be outstanding and will
automatically be canceled and will cease to exist when converted as a result
of and pursuant to the Merger. At the Effective Time, each holder of a
certificate representing Partnership Common Units (a " ** _Certificate_** ")
and each holder of non-certificated Partnership Common Units represented by
book-entry (" ** _Book-Entry Units_** ") will cease to be a limited partner of
the Partnership and cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive (a) the Merger Consideration, and the right to be admitted as
an Additional Member of Parent in connection therewith, (b) any cash to be
paid in lieu of any fractional New Common Unit in accordance with _Section
3.3(d)_, and (c) any distributions in accordance with _Section 3.3(c)_, in
each case, to be issued or paid, without interest, in consideration therefor
in accordance with _Section 3.3_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the rights of
(i) ** ** any holder of the Partnership Restricted Units will be as set forth
in _Section 3.5_, and (ii) ** ** any holder of Excluded Units will be as set
forth in _Section 3.1(d)_. In addition, holders as of the relevant record
date of Partnership Common Units immediately prior to the Effective Time will
have continued rights to any distribution, without interest, with respect to
such units with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time that may
have been declared or made by the Partnership with respect to such Partnership
Common Units in accordance with the terms of the Existing Partnership
Agreement and this Agreement and which remains unpaid as of the Effective
Time. Such distributions by the Partnership are not part of the Merger
Consideration, and will be paid on the payment date set therefor to such
holders of Partnership Common Units regardless of whether they exchange their
Partnership Common Units pursuant to _Section 3.3_. At the Effective Time,
the unit transfer books of the Partnership will be closed immediately and
there will be no further registration of transfers on the unit transfer books
of the Partnership with respect to Partnership Common Units.

 



      
 

 



 

 **3.3** ** ****_Exchange of Certificates_**.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will appoint a
commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Partnership to
act as exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of exchanging Partnership
Common Units for the Merger Consideration as required by this _Article III_
(the " ** _Exchange Agent_** "). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of the holders of the applicable Partnership Common Units, for
exchange in accordance with this _Article III_, through the Exchange Agent,
New Common Units and cash as required by this _Article III_. Parent agrees to
make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to pay any distributions pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ and to make
payments in lieu of any fractional New Common Units pursuant to _Section
3.3(d)_, in each case without interest. Any cash (including as payment for any
fractional New Common Units in accordance with _Section 3.3(d)_ and any
distributions with respect to such fractional New Common Units in accordance
with _Section 3.3(c)_) and New Common Units deposited with the Exchange Agent
are hereinafter referred to as the " ** _Exchange Fund_**." The Exchange Agent
will, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be paid for Partnership Common Units pursuant to this
Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by _Sections
3.3(c)_ and _3.3(d)_ , the Exchange Fund will not be used for any other
purpose.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will
instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of Partnership
Common Units as of the Effective Time (other than holders of Excluded Units)
(i) a letter of transmittal (specifying that in respect of certificated
Partnership Common Units, delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which will be in customary form and
agreed to by Parent and the Partnership prior to the Effective Time) (the " **
_Letter of Transmittal_** "), and (ii) instructions (in customary form and
agreed to by Parent and the Partnership prior to the Effective Time) for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Units in exchange
for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of Partnership Common Units
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Units, as applicable. Promptly
after the Effective Time, upon surrender of Certificates, if any, for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letters of transmittal,
properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents (including in
respect of Book-Entry Units) as may reasonably be required pursuant to such
instructions, each holder who held Partnership Common Units immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than (x) holders of the Partnership Restricted
Units and (y) holders of Excluded Units) will be entitled to receive upon
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Units therefor (A) New Common
Units representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of New Common Units
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article III_
(after taking into account all Partnership Common Units then held by such
holder), and (B) a check in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article III_,
including cash payable in lieu of any fractional New Common Units pursuant to
_Section 3.3(d)_ and distributions pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, any cash payment in lieu
of fractional New Common Units, or any Parent distributions payable pursuant
to _Section 3.3(c)_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Partnership
Common Units that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Partnership, the

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Partnership Common Units may
be paid to a transferee, if the Certificate representing

 

such Partnership Common Units or evidence of ownership of the Book-Entry Units
is presented to the Exchange Agent, and in the case of both certificated and
Book-Entry Units, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence
and effect such transfer and the Person requesting such exchange will pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of the delivery of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the
record holder of such Partnership Common Units, or will establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
payable. Until such required documentation has been delivered and
Certificates, if any, have been surrendered, as contemplated by this _Section
3.3_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Unit representing a Partnership Common
Unit (other than an Excluded Unit) will be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such delivery and
surrender the Merger Consideration payable in respect of Partnership Common
Units, and (without the necessity of such surrender) any cash or distributions
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Section 3.3_.

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Partnership Common Units_. No
distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Units with a
record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any
Partnership Common Units with respect to New Common Units that such holder
would be entitled to receive in accordance herewith and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional New Common Units will be paid to any such holder until such
holder has delivered the required documentation and surrendered any
Certificates or Book-Entry Units as contemplated by this _Section 3.3_.
Subject to applicable Law, following compliance with the requirements of
_Section 3.3(b)_, there will be paid to such holder of New Common Units
issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time
of such compliance, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional New
Common Units to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_
(which shall be paid by the Exchange Agent as provided therein) and the amount
of distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to New Common Units and payable with respect to such New Common
Units, and (ii) promptly after such compliance, or, if later, at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time, but prior to such delivery and surrender and a payment
date subsequent to such compliance payable with respect to such New Common
Units (which shall be paid by Parent).

 



 

(d) _Fractional New Common Units_. No certificates or scrip of New Common
Units representing fractional New Common Units or book entry credit of the
same will be issued upon the surrender of Partnership Common Units outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with _Section 3.3(b)_,
and such fractional interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
have any rights as a holder of any New Common Units. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of Partnership Common Units converted
in the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a New Common Unit (after taking into account all Partnership Common Units
exchanged by such holder) will receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest rounded up to the nearest whole cent) in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the Average Closing Price as of the Closing Date and (ii) the
fraction of a New Common Unit that such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to this _Article III_. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
fractional interests, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments
to

 



      
 

 



 

such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Further Rights in Partnership Common Units_. The Merger Consideration
issued upon conversion of a Partnership Common Unit in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section
3.3(d)_) and any declared distributions to be paid on Partnership Common Units
as described in _Section 3.3(c)_ will be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Partnership Common Unit.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Partnership Common Units after 180
days following the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand by
Parent and, from and after such delivery, any former holders of Partnership
Common Units who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ will
thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of such Partnership Common Units, any cash in lieu of fractional New Common
Units to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_, or any
distributions with respect to New Common Units to which they are entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_, in each case, without any interest thereon. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Partnership Common Units immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, be held by Parent. Without limitation of the foregoing, after
180 days following the Effective Time any amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of Partnership Common Units will become the property of Parent,
subject to the legitimate claims of any Person previously entitled thereto
under abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 



 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of an indemnity agreement or a bond, in such amount
reasonably determined by Parent, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of Partnership Common Units represented by
such Certificate and any distributions to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ and any cash payable in lieu of
fractional New Common Units to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant
to _Section 3.3(d)_.

 



 

(h) _Withholding_. Parent and the Exchange Agent are entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Partnership Common Units such amounts as Parent or the
Exchange Agent reasonably deems to be required to deduct and withhold under
the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law, with respect to
the making of such payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the
Exchange Agent, as applicable, will provide reasonable notice to the
applicable holders of Partnership Common Units prior to deducting and
withholding any amounts pursuant to this _Section 3.3(h)_. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Partnership
Common Units in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent or the Exchange Agent. The Parties agree that the Partnership intends
to deliver to Parent a valid

 



      
 

 



 

certificate of non-foreign status pursuant to U.S. Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1445-2(b) such that no withholding will be required pursuant to
Section 1445 of the Code.

 



 

(i) _Book Entry and Admission of Holders of New Common Units as Additional
Members of Parent_. All New Common Units to be issued in the Merger will be
issued in book-entry form, without physical certificates. Upon the issuance of
New Common Units to the holders of Partnership Common Units in accordance with
this _Section 3.3_ and the execution and delivery by such holder of a
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal, Parent and the Parent Board will
be deemed to have automatically consented to the admission of such holder as a
member of Parent in respect of its New Common Units such holder shall be
automatically admitted as a member of Parent and such admission will be
reflected on the books and records of Parent.

 



 

(j) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to
invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis, in Parents
sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment or loss
thereon affects the amounts payable or the timing of the amounts payable to
the Partnership Unitholders pursuant to the other provisions of this _Section
3.3_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will be
paid promptly to Parent.

 



 

(k) _Tax Characterization of Merger and Cash Received_. The Partnership and
Parent each acknowledges and agrees that for federal income Tax purposes the
transactions consummated pursuant to this Agreement will be treated as an
"assets-over" partnership merger transaction under Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.708-1(c)(1) and 1.708-1(c)(3)(i), whereby the Partnership will be
the terminating partnership and Parent will be the resulting partnership. As a
result, the transactions consummated pursuant to this Agreement shall be
treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as a contribution of all of the
assets of the Partnership to Parent in exchange for the Merger Consideration,
the cash received in lieu of fractional Parent Common Units and the assumption
of liabilities. To the maximum extent possible, any cash received in lieu of
fractional Parent Common Units and other cash deemed received in exchange for
the assets shall be treated as a reimbursement of preformation capital
expenditures described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-4(d). To the
extent any cash received in lieu of fractional Parent Common Units and other
cash deemed received in exchange for the assets exceeds the amount that can be
so treated, such excess cash will be treated as proceeds of a disguised sale
transaction described in Section 707(a)(2)(B) of the Code (a " ** _Disguised
Sale_** "). Each of the Partnership and Parent agrees to prepare and file all
U.S. federal income Tax Returns in accordance with the foregoing and shall not
take any position inconsistent therewith on any such Tax Return, or in the
course of any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to U.S.
federal income Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws
following a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
final administrative decision by an applicable Governmental Authority.

 



 

 **3.4** ** ****_Anti-Dilution Provisions_**. Without limiting the covenants
in _Sections 4.1_ and _4.2_ , in the event the outstanding Partnership
Common Units or Parent Common Units shall have been changed into a different
number of units or a different class after the date of this Agreement by
reason of any subdivisions, reclassifications, splits, unit distributions,
combinations or exchanges of Partnership Common Units or Parent Common Units,
the

 



      
 

 



 

Exchange Ratio will be correspondingly adjusted to provide to the holders of
such Partnership Common Units and Partnership Restricted Units the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 



 

 **3.5** ** ****_Treatment of the Partnership LTIP_**. Immediately prior to
the Effective Time, any award of Partnership Restricted Units that is subject
to time-based vesting and that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior
to the Effective Time will, automatically and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, become fully vested and the restrictions with respect
thereto shall lapse and such Partnership Restricted Units shall be deemed to
be Partnership Common Units for purposes of this _Article III_.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV** 
**ACTIONS PENDING CLOSING**

 



 

 **4.1** ** ****_Conduct of Business by the Partnership_**. From the date of
this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of

_provided_ , _however_ , that no action or omission by the Partnership or its

of _Sections 4.1(b)_ through _(r)_ shall be a breach of this _Section
4.1(a)_;

 



 

(b) (i) issue, sell or otherwise permit to become outstanding, or authorize
the creation of, any additional equity or any additional Rights or (ii) enter
into any agreement with respect to the foregoing;

redeem or otherwise acquire any membership, partnership or other equity
interests or Rights, except upon the forfeiture of Partnership Restricted

Except as set forth in (a) all forms, registration statements, reports,
schedules and statements filed or furnished by the Partnership with the SEC
under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since January 1, 2014 and prior
to the date of this Agreement, and in each case including all exhibits and
schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein
(collectively, the " ** _Partnership SEC Documents_** ") (but excluding any
disclosure contained in any such Partnership SEC Documents under the heading
"Risk Factors" or "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" or
similar heading (other than any historical factual information contained
within such headings, disclosure or statements)), or (b) the Partnership
Disclosure Schedule prior to the execution of this Agreement ( _provided_ that
(i) disclosure in any section of such Partnership Disclosure Schedule is
deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other section of this Agreement to
the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of the Partnership
Disclosure Schedule that such disclosure is applicable to such other section
notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross reference thereto, and
(ii) the mere inclusion of an item in such Partnership Disclosure Schedule as
an exception to a representation or warranty is not deemed an admission that
such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had, or would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Partnership (a " ** _Partnership Material Adverse Effect_** ")), the
Partnership Entities represent and warrant to Parent as follows:

 



 

 **5.1** ** ****_Organization, General Authority and Standing_**. Each
Partnership Entity is a limited partnership or limited liability company
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware
and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted.
Section 5.1 of the Partnership Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and

(c), as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **5.2** ** ****_Capitalization_**.

 



 

(a) As of the close of business on April 17, 2015, there are 28,074,433

provided in the Existing Partnership Agreement, are not subject to any
preemptive or similar rights (and were not issued in violation of any
preemptive or similar

Partnership GP has no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligation
the holders of which have the right to vote (or are convertible into or
exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the holders of the
GP Membership Interests. The GP Sellers have delivered a true, correct and
complete copy of the Partnership GP LLC Agreement to Parent.

 



 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, except as set forth above in this
_Section 5.2_, (i) there are no partnership interests, limited liability

options, warrants, preemptive rights, subscriptions, calls or other rights,
convertible securities, exchangeable securities, agreements or commitments of
any character obligating the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,
transfer or sell any partnership or other equity interest of the Partnership
or such Subsidiary or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for such
partnership interests or equity interests, or any commitment to authorize,
issue or sell the same or any such equity securities, except pursuant to this

securities having the right to vote) with the Partnership Unitholders on any
matter.

 



 

(e) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the
voting or registration of capital stock or other equity interest of the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries.

of interests in its Subsidiaries as set forth in Section 5.1 of the
Partnership Disclosure Schedule, neither the

 



      
 

 



 

Partnership nor Partnership GP owns beneficially, directly or indirectly, any
equity securities or similar interests of any person, or any interest in a
partnership or joint venture of any kind. The Partnership or Partnership GP
owns such interests in its respective Subsidiaries free and clear of all
Liens, except for Permitted Encumbrances.

consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the Partnership
Unitholder Approval, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
have been authorized by all necessary limited partnership or limited liability
company action by each Partnership Entity. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by each Partnership Entity and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Other Parties thereto,

 **5.5** ** ****_No Violations or Defaults_**. Subject to required filings
under federal and state securities laws and with the NASDAQ, assuming the
other consents and approvals contemplated by _Section 5.6_ and _Article
VIII_ are duly obtained and assuming the consents, waivers and approvals
specified in _Section 7.9(a)_ are obtained, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby by each Partnership Entity do not and will not (a)
constitute a breach or violation of, or result in a default (or an event that,
with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) under, or result
in the termination or in a right of termination or cancellation of, or
accelerate the performance required by, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
deed of trust, license, franchise, lease, contract, agreement, joint venture
or other instrument or obligation to which any Partnership Entity or any of
its respective Subsidiaries is a party or by which any Partnership Entity or
any of its Subsidiaries or properties is subject or bound except for such
breaches, violations, defaults, terminations, cancellations or accelerations
that, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect, (b) constitute a
breach or violation of, or a default under the Existing Partnership Agreement,
the Partnership Certificate of Limited Partnership, the Partnership GP LLC
Agreement or the certificate of limited partnership of Partnership GP, (c)
materially contravene or conflict with or constitute a material violation of
any provision of any Law binding upon or applicable to any Partnership Entity

Subsidiaries assets.

 



 

 **5.6** ** ****_Consents and Approvals_**. No consents or approvals of, or
filings or registrations with, any Governmental Authority are necessary in
connection with (a) the execution and delivery by each Partnership Entity of
this Agreement or (b) the consummation by any Partnership Entity of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (i) the filing with

(ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, (iii) any consents, authorizations, approvals, filings
or exemptions in connection with compliance with the rules of the NASDAQ, (iv)
such filings and approvals as may be required to be made or obtained under the
Antitrust Laws, and (v) such other consents, authorizations, approvals,
filings or registrations the absence or unavailability of which would not,
either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

 **5.7** ** ****_Financial Reports and the Partnership SEC Documents_**.

 



 

(a) Since January 1, 2014, the Partnership has filed or furnished with the SEC
all forms, registration statements, reports, schedules and statements required
to be filed or furnished under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. At the
time filed (or, in the case of registration statements, solely on the dates of
effectiveness) (except to the extent amended by a subsequently filed
Partnership SEC Document prior to the date of this Agreement, in which case as
of the date of such amendment), each Partnership SEC Document complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act, as the case may be and did not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact, or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(b) Any consolidated financial statements of the Partnership included in the
Partnership SEC Documents (the " ** _Partnership Financial Statements_** ") as
of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment) (i) complied as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto, (ii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be expressly
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, for
normal year-end adjustments (that are not individually or in the aggregate
material) and the absence of footnotes, in each case, to the extent permitted
by applicable SEC regulations)), and (iii) fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end adjustments that are not,
individually or in the aggregate, material).

 



 

 **5.8** ** ****_Internal Controls and Procedures_**. The Partnership has
established and maintains internal control over financial reporting and
disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15
and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to the
Partnership, including its Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by the
Partnership in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to the Partnerships principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms. The Partnerships principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent
evaluation, to

 



      
 

 



 

the Partnerships auditors and the audit committee of the Partnership Board
(a) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls that could adversely affect the Partnerships ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for the
Partnerships auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (b)
any fraud, regardless of whether material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Partnerships internal controls.
The principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the
Partnership have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
the Exchange Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC
with respect to the Partnership SEC Documents, and the statements contained in
such certifications were complete and correct as of the dates they were made.

 



 

 **5.9** ** ****_Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_**. Except as disclosed in
the audited financial statements (or notes thereto) included in the
Partnerships Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014
(the " ** _Balance Sheet Date_** "), and in the financial statements (or notes
thereto) included in subsequent Partnership SEC Documents filed by the
Partnership prior to the date of this Agreement, neither the Partnership nor
any of its consolidated subsidiaries had at the Balance Sheet Date or has
incurred since that date, any liabilities or obligations (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise) of any nature, except (a) liabilities,
obligations or contingencies that (i) are accrued or reserved against in the
financial statements of the Partnership included in the Partnership SEC
Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, or reflected in the notes
thereto, (ii) were incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with past practices, or (iii) relate to this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the proposal of
Parent with respect to the Merger or (b) liabilities, obligations or
contingencies that (i) would not reasonably be expected, either individually
or in the aggregate, to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect or (ii)
have been discharged or paid in full prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

 **5.10** ** ****_Absence of Certain Changes or Events_**.

 



 

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any change, event,
development, circumstance, condition, occurrence or effect that has had or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement, except
for this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) the
Partnership and Partnership GP have carried on and operated their businesses
in all material respects in the ordinary course of business and (ii) none of
the Partnership, Partnership GP or any Subsidiary of the Partnership or
Partnership GP has undertaken any action that would be prohibited by _clauses
(d)_, _(e)_ , _(g)_ , _(h)_ , _(i)_ , _(l)_ , _(o)_ , _(p)_ or (to the extent
related to any of the foregoing clauses) _(r)_ of _Section 4.1_ if such
provisions were in effect at all times since the Balance Sheet Date.

 



 

 **5.11** ** ****_Compliance with Applicable Law; Permits_**.

 



 

(a) Except with respect to Tax matters (which are provided for in _Section
5.18_) and environmental matters (which are provided for in _Section 5.13_),
each of the Partnership and Partnership GP is in compliance with all, and is
not in default under or in violation of any, applicable Law, other than any
noncompliance, default or violation that would

 



      
 

 



 

not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Partnership nor Partnership
GP has received any written communication since the Balance Sheet Date and
prior to the date of this Agreement from a Governmental Authority that alleges
that the Partnership is not in compliance with or is in default or violation
of any applicable Law, except where such non-compliance, default or violation
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Partnership GP, the Partnership and its Subsidiaries are in possession of
all franchises, tariffs, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements,
variances, exemptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any
Governmental Authority necessary under applicable Law to own, lease and
operate their properties and to lawfully carry on their businesses as they are
being conducted as of the date of this Agreement (collectively, the " **
_Partnership Permits_** "), except where the failure to be in possession of
such Partnership Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. All
Partnership Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to
be in full force and effect would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension or cancellation of any of the Partnership Permits is pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Partnership, threatened, except where such suspension or
cancellation would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **5.12** ** ****_Material Contracts_**.

time after the Closing;

Agreement may be limited by applicable Law and public policy, each of the

obligation of the Partnership or Partnership GP and constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of the other parties thereto and (ii) is in full force and
effect as of the date of this Agreement, in each case unless the failure to be

 



       
 

 



 

so would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) There is not, to the Knowledge of the Partnership, under any Partnership

under federal and state securities laws and with the NASDAQ, assuming the
other consents and approvals contemplated by _Section 5.6_ and _Article
VIII_ are duly obtained and assuming the consents, waivers and approvals
specified in _Section 7.9(a)_ are obtained, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby by Parent do not and will not (a) constitute a breach or
violation of, or result in a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse
of time or both, would become a default) under, or result in the termination
or in a right of termination or cancellation of, or accelerate the performance
required by, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
franchise, lease, contract, agreement, joint venture or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or properties is subject or bound except for
such breaches, violations, defaults, terminations, cancellations or
accelerations that, either individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect,

 



       
 

 



 

(b) constitute a breach or violation of, or a default under the Parent
Agreement or Parents certificate of formation, (c) materially contravene or
conflict with or constitute a material violation of any provision of any Law
binding upon or applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (d) result
in the creation of any material Lien on any of the assets of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries assets.

 



 

 **6.6** ** ****_Consents and Approvals_**. No consents or approvals of, or
filings or registrations with, any Governmental Authority are necessary in
connection with (a) the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of

the State of Delaware, (iii) any consents, authorizations, approvals, filings

Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the Transactions.

 



 

 **6.7** ** ****_Financial Reports and Parent SEC Documents_**.

 



 

(a) Since January 1, 2014, Parent has filed or furnished with the SEC all
forms, registration statements, reports, schedules and statements required to
be filed or furnished under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. At the
time filed (or, in the case of registration statements, solely on the dates of
effectiveness) (except to the extent amended by a subsequently filed Parent
SEC Document prior to the date of this Agreement, in which case as of the date
of such amendment), each Parent SEC Document complied in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act,
as the case may be and did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact, or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(b) Any consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents (the " ** _Parent Financial Statements_** ") as of their respective
dates (if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment) (i) complied as
to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii)
were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be expressly indicated in the notes thereto
or, in the case of unaudited statements, for normal year-end adjustments (that
are not individually or in the aggregate material) and the absence of
footnotes, in each case, to the extent permitted by applicable SEC
regulations), and (iii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for
the periods then ended (subject, in the case of

 



      
 

 



 

unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end adjustments that are not,
individually or in the aggregate, material).

 



 

 **6.8** ** ****_Internal Controls and Procedures_**. Parent has established
and maintains internal control over financial reporting and disclosure
controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule
15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent, including its
Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Parents
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms. Parents principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent
evaluation, to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board
(a) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls that could adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for Parents auditors
any material weaknesses in internal controls and (b) any fraud, regardless of
whether material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Parents internal controls. The principal executive
officer and the principal financial officer of Parent have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any
related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the
Parent SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications were
complete and correct as of the dates they were made.

 



 

 **6.9** ** ****_Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_**. Except as disclosed in
the audited financial statements (or notes thereto) included in Parents
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and in the
financial statements (or notes thereto) included in subsequent Parent SEC
Documents filed by Parent prior to the date of this Agreement, neither Parent
nor any of its consolidated subsidiaries had at the Balance Sheet Date or has
incurred since that date, any liabilities or obligations (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise) of any nature, except (a) liabilities,
obligations or contingencies that (i) are accrued or reserved against in the
financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents filed
prior to the date of this Agreement, or reflected in the notes thereto, (ii)
were incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business
and consistent with past practices or (iii) relate to this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the proposal of Parent with
respect to the Merger or (b) liabilities, obligations or contingencies that
(i) would not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate,
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) have been discharged or paid
in full prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

 **6.10** ** ****_Absence of Certain Changes or Events_**.

 



 

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any change, event,
development, circumstance, condition, contribution, occurrence or effect that
has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement, except
for this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) Parent and
its Subsidiaries have carried on and operated their respective businesses in
all material respects in the ordinary course of business and (ii) none of
Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent has undertaken any action that would be
prohibited by _clauses (d)_, _(e)_ , _(f)_ , _(g)_ , _(j)_ or (to the extent
related to any of the foregoing clauses) _(l)_ of _Section 4.2_ if such
provisions were in effect at all times since the Balance Sheet Date.

 



 

 **6.11** ** ****_Compliance with Applicable Law; Permits_**.

 



 

(a) Except with respect to Tax matters (which are provided for in _Section
6.18_) and environmental matters (which are provided for in _Section 6.13_),
each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all, and is not in
default under or in violation of any applicable Law, other than any
noncompliance, default or violation that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
communication since the Balance Sheet Date and prior to the date of this
Agreement from a Governmental Authority that alleges that Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is not in compliance with or is in default or violation of any
applicable Law, except where such non-compliance, default or violation would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises, tariffs,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exemptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority
necessary under applicable Law to own, lease and operate their properties and
to lawfully carry on their businesses as they are being conducted as of the
date of this Agreement (collectively, the " ** _Parent Permits_** "), except
where the failure to be in possession of such Parent Permits would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. All Parent Permits are in full force and effect,
except where the failure to be in full force and effect would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the Parent
Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, except where
such suspension or cancellation would not individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **6.12** ** ****_Material Contracts_**. (a) Section 6.12 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule contains a listing of the following contracts to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in effect on the date of this
Agreement (each contract that is described in this _Section 6.12_ being a "

(i) each "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC);

this Agreement;

 



 

(vi) each contract expressly limiting or restricting the ability of Parent or
its Subsidiaries to make distributions or declare or pay dividends in respect

or is subject; and

 



 

(viii) each agreement under which Parent has advanced or loaned any amount of
money to any of its officers, directors, employees or consultants, in each
case with a principal amount in excess of $100,000.

 



 

(b) Except to the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity; and provided that any indemnity, contribution
and exoneration provisions contained in any such Parent Material Agreement may
be limited by applicable Law and public policy, each of the Parent Material
Agreements (i) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Parent and
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the other parties thereto and
(ii) is in full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement, in each
case unless the failure to be so would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) There is not, to the Knowledge of Parent, under any Parent Material
Agreement, any default or event that, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default on the part of any of the parties thereto, or any
notice of termination, cancellation or material modification, in each case,
except such events of default, other events, notices or modifications as to
which requisite waivers or consents have been obtained or which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

 **6.13** ** ****_Environmental Matters_**. Except as reflected in the Parent
Financial Statements, and except for any such matter that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect:

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries and its assets, real properties and
operations are in compliance with all Environmental Laws and Environmental
Permits;

 



 

(b) Neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries have received any written notice from
any Governmental Authority alleging, with respect to any such entity or any of
their respective assets, real properties (whether owned or leased or formerly
owned or leased) or operations, the violation of or liability under any
Environmental Law (including liability as a potentially responsible party
under CERCLA or any analogous state laws) or any Environmental Permit that
remains pending or unresolved;

 



 

(c) There are no actions, suits, proceedings (including civil, criminal,
administrative and dispute resolution proceedings), claims, causes of action,
government investigations, orders, decrees or judgments pending or in effect,
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened by a Governmental Authority or
other third party against Parent or its Subsidiaries that allege a violation
of or liability under any Environmental Law that remain pending or unresolved,
and, to the Knowledge of Parent, there are no existing facts or circumstances
that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any such action, suit,
proceeding, claim, cause of action, investigation, order, decree or judgment
that remain pending or unresolved;

 



 

(d) There has been no Release of any Hazardous Material by Parent or its
Subsidiaries in violation of Environmental Law at, on, under or from any real
properties as a result of the operations of Parent or its Subsidiaries that
has not been remediated as required by any Environmental Law or otherwise
adequately reserved for in the Parent Financial Statements; and

 



 

(e) This _Section 6.13_ constitutes the sole and exclusive representation and
warranty of Parent with respect to Environmental Permits, Hazardous Materials
and Environmental Law.

 



 

 **6.14** ** ****_Reserve Report_**. The factual, non-interpretive data
relating to the Oil and Gas Properties of Parent on which the reserve report
prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, referred to in Parents Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 (the " ** _Parent
Reserve Report_** ") was based was accurate in all material respects at the
time such data was provided to DeGolyer and MacNaughton. With respect to the
proved reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve Report, the Parent Reserve
Report conforms in all material respects to the guidelines with respect
thereto of the SEC. Except for changes (including changes in Hydrocarbon
commodity prices) generally affecting the oil and gas industry and normal
depletion by production, there has been no change in respect of the matters
addressed in the Parent Reserve Report that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **6.15** ** ****_Title to Properties_**. Parent and its Subsidiaries have
good and indefeasible title to all real and personal properties that are
material to the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries,

 



      
 

 



 

in each case free and clear of all Liens and defects and imperfections of
title except (a) such as do not materially affect the value of such property
and do not materially interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of
such property by Parent and its Subsidiaries, (b) for Permitted Encumbrances
and (c) such as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **6.16** ** ****_Litigation_**. As of the date of this Agreement, there are
no Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, against
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is otherwise a party or, to the Knowledge of Parent, a threatened
party, except for Proceedings that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

 **6.17** ** ****_Information Supplied_**. Subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Partnership set forth in _Article V_,
none of the information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or on
behalf of Parent specifically for inclusion in (a) the Registration Statement
will, at the time the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, is filed with the SEC or at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading or (b) the Proxy Statement (which will be
included as a prospectus in the Registration Statement) will, on the date the
Proxy Statement is first mailed to Partnership Unitholders and at the time of
the Partnership Unitholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Registration
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
makes no representation or warranty with respect to information supplied by or
on behalf of the Partnership for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
any of the foregoing documents.

(c) there is no Proceeding now pending against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax or Tax Return, nor has any written
adjustment with respect to a Tax Return or written claim for additional Tax

(d) no written claim has been made by any Tax authority in a jurisdiction

(h) none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return or has any

Subsidiaries), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise;

 



 

(i) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries that is classified as a partnership
for U.S. federal tax purposes has in effect a valid election under Section 754
of the Code;

purposes, and not as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable
as a corporation under Section 7704 of the Code, and has been properly treated
as such since its formation; and

 



 

(k) each Subsidiary of Parent is currently (and has been since its respective
formation) either (i) properly classified as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes or (ii) properly disregarded as an entity separate from
its respective owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 301.7701-3(b).

 



 

 **6.19** ** ****_Employee Benefits_**.

 



 

(a) Section 6.19(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and accurate list of each material Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained
or contributed to by Parent or any of its ERISA Affiliates during the six-year
period preceding the Closing Date, or for which Parent or any of its ERISA
Affiliates has or could have any liability, contingent or otherwise (each, a "
** _Parent Employee Benefit Plan_** ").

 



 

(b) With respect to each Parent Employee Benefit Plan, Parent has heretofore
made available to the Partnership a true and complete copy, or summary if no

Authority within the prior three (3) years.

 



 

(c) Each Parent Employee Benefit Plan has been administered in all respects in
accordance with its terms, and in compliance with the applicable provisions of
all Laws applicable to such Parent Employee Benefit Plan, and complies with
such terms and such Laws, in each case except where the failure to be so
administered or to so comply, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There are no
investigations by any Governmental Authority, termination proceedings or other
claims (except routine claims for benefits payable under the Parent Employee
Benefit Plans) or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened against or involving any Parent Employee Benefit Plan or asserting
any rights to, or claims for benefits under, any Parent Employee Benefit Plan
that would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent

Affiliates under (i) Title IV of ERISA, (ii) Section 302 of ERISA, (iii)
Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, (iv) to the Knowledge of Parent, a

rely upon an opinion letter for a master/prototype plan or an advisory letter
for a volume submitter plan and, to the Knowledge of Parent, nothing has
occurred that could adversely affect the qualified status of any such Parent
Employee Benefit Plan. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each Parent Employee Benefit Plan
conforms with or is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and no "prohibited
transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406
and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA, has
occurred with respect to any Parent Employee Benefit Plan and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, no fiduciary (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of
ERISA) of any Parent Employee Benefit Plan subject to Part 4 of Title I of
ERISA has committed a breach of fiduciary duty that could subject the
Partnership to material liability taken as a whole. Each Parent Employee
Benefit Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the
Closing in accordance with its terms, without liability to Parent or the
Partnership (other than ordinary administration expenses and payment of
accrued benefits).

 



 

(e) Except as set forth on Section 6.19(e) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
no payments (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and related
regulations) have or will be made under a Parent Employee Benefit Plan in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby that,
in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result

 



      
 

 



 

in the imposition of sanctions imposed under Sections 280G and 4999 of the
Code, and there are no Liens arising from or relating to any Parent Employee
Benefit Plan.

 



 

(f) Except as set forth on Section 6.19(f) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
to the Knowledge of Parent, no Parent Employee Benefit Plan or any other
arrangement maintained by Parent or its Affiliates provides any of the
following retiree or post-employment benefits to any Person: medical,
disability (other than disability benefits relating to a disability occurring
during relevant employment) or life insurance benefits, except as required by
(i) the applicable requirements of Section 4980B of the Code or any similar
state law or (ii) company-paid or subsidized healthcare coverage pursuant to
an employment, severance or similar agreement, plan or arrangement. Except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, each of Parent and each of its ERISA Affiliates is in compliance with
(A) the requirements of the applicable health care continuation and notice
provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended, and the regulations (including proposed regulations) thereunder and
any similar state Law and (B) the applicable requirements of the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the
regulations (including the proposed regulations) thereunder.

 



 

(g) Parent is, and has been, in compliance in all respects with all applicable
Law relating to the employment of labor, including all such applicable Law
relating to wages, hours, collective bargaining, discrimination, civil rights,
safety and health and workers compensation, except where the failure to
comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(h) None of Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party to, or subject to, a
collective bargaining agreement with any labor union or representative of any
individuals employed by Parent or any of its Affiliates, and no organizational
activity has occurred, or to the Knowledge of Parent has been threatened, in
each case within the past six years. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, threatened, labor disputes, strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages,
requests for representation, pickets or work slow-downs, nor has such event or
labor difficult occurred within the past three years.

 



 

 **6.20** ** ****_Intellectual Property_**. Parent and its Subsidiaries own or
have the right to use all Intellectual Property necessary for the operation of
the businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted
(collectively, the " ** _Parent Intellectual Property_** ") free and clear of
all Liens except for Permitted Encumbrances, except where the failure to own
or have the right to use such Intellectual Property would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. To the Knowledge of Parent, the use of the Parent Intellectual
Property by Parent and its Subsidiaries in the operation of Parents business
as presently conducted does not infringe upon or misappropriate any
Intellectual Property of any other Person, except for such matters that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **6.21** ** ****_Related Party Transactions_**. Except as disclosed in the
Parent SEC Documents, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries are party to
any transaction or arrangement under which any (a) present or former executive
officer or director of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, (b) beneficial
owner (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of 5% or more

 



      
 

 



 

of any class of equity of Parent or (c) Affiliate, "associate" or member of
the "immediate family" (as such terms are respectively defined in Rules 12b-2
and 16a-1 of the Exchange Act) of any of the foregoing is a party to any
actual or proposed loan, lease or other contract with or binding upon Parent
or any Subsidiary of Parent or owns or has any interest in any of their
respective properties or assets, in each case as would be required to be
disclosed by Parent pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

 



 

 **6.22** ** ****_Insurance_**. Parent and its Subsidiaries maintain, or are
entitled to the benefits of, insurance in such amounts and against such risks
substantially as Parent believes to be customary for the industries in which
it and its Subsidiaries operate. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (a)
all material insurance policies maintained by or on behalf of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement are in full force and
effect, and all premiums due on such policies have been paid by Parent or its

 **ARTICLE VII 
COVENANTS**

 



 

The Partnership Entities hereby covenant to and agree with the Parent
Entities, and Parent and Merger Sub hereby covenant to and agree with the
Partnership Entities, that:

 



 

 **7.1** ** ****_Consummation of the Transactions_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
7.1(d)_), each of the Parent Entities, on the one hand, and each of the
Partnership Entities, on the other hand, will cooperate with the other and use
(and will cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best
efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be
done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to
the Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable (and in any event no
later than the Outside Date) and to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions, including preparing and
filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notifications, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, applications and other documents (including any required or
recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), (ii) obtain promptly
(and in any event no later than the Outside Date) all approvals, consents,
clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, registrations,
permits (including Environmental Permits), authorizations and other
confirmations from any Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate the Transactions, (iii) defend any lawsuits or
other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions and (iv) obtain all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties. For purposes of
this Agreement, " ** _Antitrust Laws_** " means the Sherman Act, as amended,
the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and all other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that
are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party hereto
agrees to cooperate with each other to determine if the transactions
contemplated hereby require a filing and observation of the waiting period
under the HSR Act and, if required, to make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the

 



      
 

 



 

transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event
within 15 Business Days after the date of this Agreement and to supply as
promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested by any Governmental Authority pursuant to the HSR Act or
any other Antitrust Law and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken (including by their respective Subsidiaries), all other actions
consistent with this _Section 7.1_ necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date). Parent shall
bear and pay the fees payable in connection with any filings required to be
made under the HSR Act.

 



 

(c) Each of the Parties hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry
by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including
any proceeding initiated by a private Person, (ii) promptly inform the Other
Parties of (and supply to the Other Parties) any communication received by
such Party from, or given by such Party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental
Authority and any material communication received or given in connection with
any proceeding by a private Person, in each case regarding the Transactions
(iii) permit the Other Parties to review in advance and incorporate their
reasonable comments in any communication to be given by it to any Governmental
Authority with respect to obtaining any clearances required under any
Antitrust Law in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv)
consult with the Other Parties in advance of any meeting or teleconference
with any Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private Person, with any other Person, and, to the extent not prohibited by
the Governmental Authority or other Person, give the Other Parties the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and teleconferences.
Subject to _Section 7.4(b)_, the Parties will take reasonable best efforts to
share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other
privilege pursuant to this _Section 7.1_ in a manner so as to preserve the
applicable privilege. Any Party may share information with any Other Party on
an "outside counsel only" basis. Nothing in this _Section 7.1_ shall obligate
the Parties to share any information regarding the value of the transaction
or, absent the entry of a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement,
information covered by the attorney client privilege, work product doctrine or
other similar privilege.

 



 

(d) Parent agrees to take, or cause to be taken (including by its
Subsidiaries), any and all steps and to make, or cause to be made (including
by its Subsidiaries), any and all undertakings necessary to resolve any
objections that a Governmental Authority or any other Person may assert under
any Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions, in
each case, so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and
in any event no later than the Outside Date (including any extension thereof
provided for in this Agreement or agreed to in writing by the Parties);
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, nothing in this _Section 7.1_ shall require, or be construed to
require, any Party to sell or otherwise dispose of, hold separate (through the
establishment of a trust or otherwise), divest itself of or

 



      
 

 



 

limit the ownership or operations of all or any portion of their respective
businesses, assets or operations.

 



 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this _Section 7.1_, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private Person, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the Transactions as violative of any
Antitrust Law, each of Parent and the Partnership will use reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

 **7.2** ** ****_Registration Statement; Proxy Statement._**

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Partnership will prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement and the
Partnership and Parent will jointly prepare and Parent will file with the SEC
the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a
prospectus. Each of the Partnership and Parent will use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and keep the
Registration Statement effective for so long as necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent also agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky"
permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Partnership will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Partnership Unitholders as
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective
under the Securities Act. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the
Registration Statement will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment
or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Partnership without
providing the Other Parties a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating
to the Partnership or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors
or officers, is discovered by the Partnership or Parent that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Registration Statement or
the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information will
promptly notify the Other Parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information will be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the Partnership
Unitholders. The Parties will notify each other promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or
the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or
the Registration Statement or for additional information and will supply each
other with copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or
the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating
to the Registration Statement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Partnership will, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date
of this Agreement, establish a record date for, and, subject to _Section
7.3_, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Registration Statement
being declared effective by the SEC, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold, the Partnership Meeting. If reasonably practicable, the Partnership
Meeting shall be held within 45 days after the mailing of the Proxy Statement.
Subject to _Section 7.3_, the Partnership GP will, through the Partnership
Board, (i) determine that the Merger is in the best interests of the
Partnership and the Partnership Unitholders and (ii) recommend that the
Partnership Unitholders approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger (the " ** _Partnership Board
Recommendation_** "). The Proxy Statement shall (subject to _Section 7.3_)
include the Partnership Board Recommendation. Unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article IX_, the Partnerships obligations to
call, give notice of and hold the Partnership Meeting in accordance with this
_Section 7.2(b)_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the making,
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Superior Proposal
or Alternative Proposal, or by any Partnership Change in Recommendation.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Partnership agrees that:
(i) unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Article
IX_ (including, if applicable, upon payment of the Termination Fee), the
Partnership shall not submit any Superior Proposal to a vote of the
Partnership Unitholders; and (ii) the Partnership shall not (without Parents
prior written consent) adjourn, postpone or, subject to termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_, cancel (or propose, publicly or
otherwise, or resolve to adjourn, postpone or cancel) the Partnership Meeting.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Partnership
may postpone or adjourn the Partnership Meeting (A) in the absence of proxies
sufficient to obtain the Partnership Unitholder Approval, to solicit
additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining Partnership Unitholder
Approval, (B) in the absence of a quorum or (C) to allow reasonable additional
time for the filing or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that
the Partnership has determined after consultation with outside legal counsel
is necessary for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated
and reviewed by the Partnership Unitholders prior to Partnership Meeting.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if there occurs a
Partnership Change in Recommendation and this Agreement is not terminated in
accordance with _Article IX_, the Partnership shall remain required to call,
hold and convene the Partnership Meeting unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms.

 



 

 **7.3** ** ****_Alternative Proposals; Change in Recommendation_**.

 



 

(a) The Partnership will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective directors, officers, and employees to, and will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause their respective other Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to an Alternative Proposal. Except as
permitted by this _Section 7.3_, the Partnership will not, and will cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers and employees
not to, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer
that would reasonably be expected to lead to the submission of any Alternative
Proposal, or (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public information with respect
to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative Proposal.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval, (1) the Partnership has
received a written Alternative Proposal that was not solicited after the date
of this Agreement and that the Partnership Board believes is _bona fide_ , and
that did not result from a material breach of this _Section 7.3_ and (2) the
Partnership Board, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, determines in good faith that such Alternative Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be likely to lead to or result in a Superior
Proposal, then the Partnership may, subject to clauses (x), (y) and (z) below,
(A) furnish information, including non-public information, with respect to the
Partnership and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Alternative
Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such
Alternative Proposal; _provided_ that (x) substantially concurrently with
furnishing any such non-public information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person, the Partnership gives Parent written notice of
the identity of such Person and the Partnerships intention to furnish non-
public information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person, (y) the Partnership receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement between the Partnership and such Person with
confidentiality provisions that are not less restrictive to such Person than
the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent and (z) the
Partnership will provide to Parent any non-public information about the
Partnership and its Subsidiaries that was not previously provided or made
available to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with providing or
making available such non-public information to such other Person.

 



 

(b) In addition to the obligations of the Partnership set forth in _Section
7.3(a)_, the Partnership will promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours
after receipt) (i) advise Parent in writing of any Alternative Proposal (and
any changes thereto) and the material terms and conditions of any such
Alternative Proposal, including the identity of such Person making such
Alternative Proposal, and (ii) provide Parent with copies of all written
proposals or draft agreements received by the Partnership or any
Representative of the Partnership setting forth the terms and conditions of,
or otherwise relating to, such Alternative Proposal. The Partnership will keep
Parent reasonably informed of material developments with respect to any such
Alternative Proposal, offers, inquiries or requests (and the Partnership shall
promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide Parent
with copies of any additional written proposals received by the Partnership or
that the Partnership has delivered to any third party making an Alternative
Proposal relating to such Alternative Proposal) and of the status of any such
discussions or negotiations. The Partnership Entities agree that neither
Partnership Entity nor any of the Subsidiaries of the Partnership will enter
into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement
that prohibits the Partnership from providing any information to Parent in
accordance with this _Section 7.3_.

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.3_, the Partnership Board
shall not: (i) (A) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent
the Partnership Board Recommendation, (B) fail to include the Partnership
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (C) publicly approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Alternative
Proposal (any action described in this _Section 7.3(c)(i)_ being referred to
as a " ** _Partnership Change in Recommendation_** "); (ii) approve, adopt or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

partnership agreement, or other similar contract or any tender or exchange
offer providing for, with respect to, or in connection with, any Alternative
Proposal; (iii) fail to announce publicly within ten Business Days after a
tender offer or exchange offer relating to the Partnership Units shall have
been commenced that the Partnership Board recommends rejection of such tender
offer or exchange offer and reaffirming the Partnership Board Recommendation;
or (iv) resolve, agree or publicly propose to, or permit the Partnership or
any Representative of the Partnership to agree or publicly propose to take any
of the actions referred to in this _Section 7.3(c)_. For the avoidance of
doubt, a public statement that describes the Partnerships receipt of an
Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
shall not be deemed a Partnership Change in Recommendation.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the Partnership receives a written
Alternative Proposal (and such proposal is not withdrawn) that the Partnership
Board believes is _bona fide_ , (ii) such Acquisition Proposal did not result
from a breach of this _Section 7.3_ and (iii) the Partnership Board
determines, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, then
the Partnership Board may at any time prior to obtaining the Partnership
Unitholder Approval, terminate this Agreement and pay Parent a Termination Fee
or effect a Partnership Change in Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Partnership Board may not take such action pursuant to the foregoing
unless:

 



 

(i) the Partnership has provided prior written notice to Parent specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons for such action (including a description of the
material terms of such Superior Proposal and delivering to Parent a copy of
any current draft of any proposed definitive agreement providing for the
Alternative Proposal for such Superior Proposal in the form to be entered into
and any other relevant proposed transaction agreements) at least two Business
Days in advance of its intention to take such action with respect to a
Partnership Change in Recommendation, unless at the time such notice is
otherwise required to be given there are less than two Business Days prior to
the Partnership Meeting, in which case the Partnership will provide as much
notice as is reasonably practicable (the period inclusive of all such days,
the " ** _Notice Period_** ") (it being understood and agreed that any
material amendment to the terms of a Superior Proposal shall require a new
notice pursuant to this _Section 7.3(d)(i)_ and a new Notice Period); and

 



 

(ii) during the Notice Period, the Partnership has negotiated with Parent in
good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding any revisions
to or adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by
Parent.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Partnership Board is permitted, at any time prior to obtaining the Partnership
Unitholder Approval, other than in connection with an Alternative Proposal, to
make a Partnership Change in Recommendation in response to an Intervening
Event, but only if (i) prior to taking any such action, the Partnership Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with and considering the advice
of the Partnerships outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Delaware law, the
Existing Partnership Agreement or the Partnership GP LLC Agreement, (ii) the
Partnership has given at least three Business Days advance written notice to
Parent that the Partnership Board intends to take such action

 



      
 

 



 

(which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the reasons for such action)
and (iii) during such period the Partnership has negotiated with Parent in
good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding any revisions
to or adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by
Parent. If after compliance with the foregoing clauses (i)  (iii) the
Partnership Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a
Partnership Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its duties
under applicable Delaware law, the Existing Partnership Agreement or the
Partnership GP LLC Agreement, then the Partnership Board may, at any time
prior to obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval, effect a Partnership
Change in Recommendation. An " ** _Intervening Event_** " means a material
event, circumstance, state of facts, occurrence, development or change that
did not exist or was not known to the Partnership Board on the date of this
Agreement (or if known, the consequences of which were not known or reasonably
foreseeable by the Partnership Board as of the date of this Agreement), which
event, circumstance, state of facts, occurrence, development or change, or any
material consequences thereof, becomes known to the Partnership Board prior to
the receipt of the Partnership Unitholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (A) in no event shall the receipt, existence, potential for or terms of
an Alternative Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof
constitute an Intervening Event and (B) if the Intervening Event relates to a
change, event, development, circumstance, condition, occurrence or effect
involving the Partnership, then none of the following changes, events,
developments, circumstances, conditions, occurrences or effects shall
constitute an Intervening Event: (1) changes in the general economic,
financial, credit or securities markets, including prevailing interest rates
or currency rates, or regulatory or political conditions and changes in oil,
natural gas, condensate or natural gas liquids prices or prices of other
commodities, including changes in price differentials; (2) changes in general
economic conditions in the (v) oil and gas exploration and production
industry, (w) natural gas gathering, compressing, treating, processing and
transportation industry generally, (x) the natural gas liquids fractionating
and transportation industry generally, (y) the crude oil and condensate
logistics and marketing industry generally, and (z) the natural gas marketing
and trading industry generally; (3) the announcement or pendency of this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, performance of obligations
under this Agreement); and (4) changes in any Laws or regulations applicable
to the Partnership or the industries in which the Partnership or Parent
operate or applicable accounting regulations or the interpretations thereof.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement will prevent the Partnership or the
Partnership Board from taking and disclosing to the Partnership Unitholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Partnership Unitholders) or
from making any legally required disclosure to Partnership Unitholders. Any
"stop-look-and-listen" communication by the Partnership or the Partnership
Board to the Partnership Unitholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Partnership
Unitholders) will not be considered a failure to make, or a withdrawal,
modification or change in any manner adverse to Parent of, all or a portion of
the Partnership Board Recommendation.

 



 

(g) The Partnership agrees that it will not release or permit the release of a
Person from, or amend, waive or permit the amendment or waiver of any
provisions of, any "standstill" or similar agreement or provision to which the
Partnership is or becomes a party or

 



      
 

 



 

under which the Partnership has any rights, and will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to enforce such agreement or provision at the request of
Parent.

 



 

(h) The Partnership acknowledges and agrees that any action inconsistent with
any provision set forth in this _Section 7.3_ that is taken by a
Representative of the Partnership that, if taken by the Partnership would have
been a material breach of this _Section 7.3_, shall be deemed to constitute a
breach of such provision by the Partnership.

 



 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " ** _Alternative Proposal_** " means any proposal or offer from any
Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) other than
Parent and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (A) ** ** direct or indirect

transactions) of assets of the Partnership equal to 20% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Partnership or to which 20% or more of the
Partnerships revenues or earnings are attributable, (B) ** ** direct or
indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of the Partnerships equity securities, (C)
** ** tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
beneficially owning 20% or more of the Partnerships equity securities or (D)
** ** merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Partnership that is structured to permit such Person or group to acquire
beneficial ownership of at least 20% of the Partnerships consolidated assets
or equity interests; in each case, other than the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

(ii) " ** _Superior Proposal_** " means a written offer that was not solicited

assets of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries, or (B) related to a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transactions involving the Partnership, in
each case made by a third party, which did not result from a material breach
of _Section 7.3_, is on terms and conditions that the Partnership Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, to be more favorable to the Partnership Unitholders
than the Merger, taking into account at the time of determination (a) relevant
financial considerations, (b) the identity of the person making such offer,
(c) the anticipated timing, conditions and prospects for completion of the
transactions contemplated by such offer, (d) the other terms and conditions of
such offer and the implications thereof on the Partnership, including relevant
legal, regulatory and other aspects of such offer and (e) any changes to the
terms of this Agreement that as of that time had been committed to by Parent
in writing.

 



 

 **7.4** ** ****_Access to Information; Confidentiality_**.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to afford to the Other Parties and their respective
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours (and, with
respect to books and records, the right to copy) to all of

 



      
 

 



 

its and its Subsidiaries properties, commitments, books, contracts, records
and correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form),
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives. Each Party shall furnish promptly to the Other Parties (i) a

operating reports, in each case, to the extent as prepared by the Partnership
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. Except for
disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, each
Party and its Representatives shall hold information received from the Other
Parties pursuant to this _Section 7.4_ in confidence in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(b) This _Section 7.4_ shall not require any Party to permit any access, or
to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith judgment
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of such Party
would reasonably be expected to result in (i) any violation of any contract or
Law to which such Party or its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject or cause
any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that such Party or any of
its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to
such information and such undermining of such privilege could in such Partys
good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel) adversely affect in any material respect such Partys position in any
pending or, what such Party believes in good faith (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel) could be, future litigation or (ii) if
such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Other Parties
or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a
litigation, such information being reasonably pertinent thereto; _provided_
that, in the case of clause (i), the Parties hereto shall cooperate in seeking
to find a way to allow disclosure of such information (including by entering
into a joint-defense or similar agreement) to the extent doing so (1) would
not (in the good faith belief of the Party being requested to disclose the
information (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel))
reasonably be likely to result in the violation of any such contract or Law or
reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to
such information or (2) could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the
party being requested to disclose the information (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed through the use of
customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which non-employee
Representatives of the Other Parties shall be provided access to such
information; _provided, further_ , that the Party being requested to disclose
the information shall (x) notify the Other Parties that such disclosures are
reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries obligations under any
such contract or Law or are reasonably likely to cause such privilege to be
undermined, (y) communicate to the Other Parties in reasonable detail the
facts giving rise to such notification and the subject matter of such
information (to the extent it is able to do so in accordance with the first
proviso in this _Section 7.4(b)_) and (z) in the case where such disclosures
are reasonably likely to violate its or

 



      
 

 



 

its Subsidiaries obligations under any contract, use reasonable commercial
efforts to seek consent from the applicable third party to any such contract
with respect to the disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not
otherwise expressly prohibited by the terms of such contract).

 



 

(c) Prior to and after the Closing, GP Sellers and their Affiliates shall
provide Parent access to the personnel, books, work papers and records of GP
Sellers and their Affiliates relating to Partnership GP, the Partnership and
its Subsidiaries to the extent reasonably necessary to enable Parent to
prepare financial statements of Partnership GP, the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries in such form and covering such periods as may be required by any
applicable securities Laws to be filed with the SEC. Furthermore, GP Sellers
and their Affiliates shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the independent public accountants of Partnership GP, the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries to provide any consent necessary to the filing of such financial
statements with the SEC and to provide such customary representation letters
as are necessary in connection therewith. All of the financial statements,
reports, opinions and related activities to be prepared, provided, delivered,
made available or undertaken pursuant to this _Section 7.4(c)_ shall be
prepared, provided, delivered, made available and undertaken at the sole cost
and expense of Parent.

 



 

(d) For a period of three years following the Closing, GP Sellers and their
Affiliates shall retain all books, records, information and documents in
possession of GP Sellers and their Affiliates that are necessary to prepare
and audit financial statements with respect to the assets and liabilities of,
or otherwise relating to, Partnership GP, the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries, except to the extent originals or copies thereof are transferred
to Parent in connection with Closing.

 



 

 **7.5** ** ****_Public Statements_**. The initial press release with respect
to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Partnership. Parent and the
Partnership will not, and each of the foregoing will cause its Representatives
not to, issue any public announcements or make other public disclosures
regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, without the
prior written approval of the Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party
or its Representatives may issue a public announcement or other public
disclosures required by Law or the rules of any stock exchange upon which such
Partys or its Parent entitys capital stock is traded, _provided_ such Party
uses reasonable best efforts to afford the Other Parties an opportunity to
first review the content of the proposed disclosure and provide reasonable
comment regarding same; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 7.5_
shall not be deemed to restrict in any manner the Partnerships ability to
communicate with its employees and that the Partnership shall not be required
by this _Section 7.5_ to consult with any Other Party with respect to a
public announcement in connection with the receipt and existence of an
Alternative Proposal and matters related thereto or a Partnership Change in
Recommendation, subject to the obligations set forth in _Section 7.3_.

 



 

 **7.6** ** ****_Confidentiality_**. The obligations of Parent and the
Partnership under the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and all information provided to any Party hereto or its Representatives
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement is deemed to be "Confidential
Information" as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to
restrict the

 



       
 

 



 

performance by the Partnership or Parent of their respective obligations under
this Agreement, and in the case of any conflict between the terms of this
Agreement and the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement the terms of this
Agreement shall control.

 



 

 **7.7** ** ****_Takeover Laws_**. Neither the Partnership nor Parent will
take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, and each
of them will take all reasonable steps within its control to exempt (or ensure
the continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
from the Takeover Laws of any state that purport to apply to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

 **7.8** ** ****_New Common Units Listed_**. Parent will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to list, prior to the Closing, on the NASDAQ Global Select
Market, upon official notice of issuance, the New Common Units.

 



 

 **7.9** ** ****_Third-Party Approvals_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and the
Partnership and their respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to prepare all documentation, to
effect all filings, to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all Governmental Authorities and third parties necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with
the terms and conditions of such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations and to cause the Transactions to be consummated as
expeditiously as practicable. Each of Parent and the Partnership has the right
to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the
other, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, with respect to, all material written information submitted to
any third party or any Governmental Authorities in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the Parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and promptly. Each
Party hereto agrees that it will consult with the Other Parties with respect
to the obtaining of all material permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
each Party will keep the Other Parties apprised of the status of material
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and the Partnership agrees, upon request, to furnish the
Other Parties with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries,
directors, officers and unitholders and such other matters as may reasonably
be necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the
Registration Statement or any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such Other Parties or any of such Other Partys Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

(c) This _Section 7.9_ shall not apply to (i) approval under Antitrust Laws
or (ii) approval of the SEC of the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **7.10** ** ****_Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_**.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or
indemnification agreement or under the Existing Partnership Agreement, this
Agreement or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of
any of the Partnerships Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Entity, jointly and severally, will: (i) indemnify
and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time
prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of Partnership
GP, the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries and also with respect to any
such Person, in such Persons capacity as a director, officer, employee,
member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, foundation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise
(regardless of whether such other entity or enterprise is affiliated with the
Partnership) serving at the request of or on behalf of Partnership GP, the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries and together with such Persons heirs,
executors or administrators (collectively, the " ** _Indemnified Parties_** ")
to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law in connection
with any Claim or Action and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
Indemnification Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) resulting therefrom;
and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within 15 days after any request for
advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, any Indemnification
Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or
otherwise participating with respect to any Claim or Action in advance of the
final disposition of such Claim or Action, including payment on behalf of or
advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Indemnification Expenses incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect
to such indemnification or advancement, in each case without the requirement
of any bond or other security. The indemnification and advancement obligations
of Parent and the Surviving Entity pursuant to this _Section 7.10(a)_ extend
to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim
or Action relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the consideration and approval thereof and the process
undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim or Action relating thereto),
and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder continue
as to any Indemnified Party who has ceased to be a director or officer of
Partnership GP, the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries after the date of
this Agreement and inure to the benefit of such persons heirs, executors and
personal and legal representatives. As used in this _Section 7.10_: (x) the
term " ** _Claim_** " means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed
action or proceeding, whether instituted by any Party hereto, any Governmental
Authority or any other person, that any Indemnified Party in good faith
believes might lead to the institution of any action or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including any
arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism (" ** _Action_**
"), arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified
Partys duties or service as a director, officer, employee, member, trustee or
other fiduciary of Partnership GP, the Partnership or of any of its
Subsidiaries or as a trustee of (or in a similar capacity with) any
compensation and benefit plan of any thereof; (y) the term " **
_Indemnification Expenses_** " means documented out of pocket attorneys fees
and expenses and all other reasonable and documented out of pocket costs,
expenses and obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses, court
costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating,

 



      
 

 



 

printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier
charges) paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a
witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to
investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which
indemnification is sought pursuant to this _Section 7.10(a)_, including any
Action relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an
Indemnified Party; and (z) the phrase "to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by applicable Law" includes, but is not limited to (1) to the
fullest extent authorized or permitted by any provision of the DRULPA and the
DLLCA that authorizes or permits additional indemnification by agreement or
otherwise, or the corresponding provision of any amendment to or replacement
of the DRULPA and the DLLCA and (2) to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the DRULPA and the DLLCA
adopted after the date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which an
entity may indemnify its directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or
fiduciaries or persons serving in any capacity in which any Indemnified Party
serves, _provided_ that any amendment, alteration or repeal of the DRULPA or
the DLLCA that adversely affects any right of any Indemnified Party will be
prospective only and does not limit or eliminate any such right with respect
to any Claim or Action involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any
action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.
Neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity will settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened Claim or Action in
respect of which indemnification has been or could be sought by such
Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such Claim or Action without admission or finding of
wrongdoing, or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the Indemnitees as provided in the Existing
Partnership Agreement (or, as applicable, the charter, bylaws, partnership
agreement, limited liability company agreement, or other organizational
documents of any of Partnership GP or the Partnerships Subsidiaries) and
indemnification agreements of Partnership GP, the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries will be assumed by the Surviving Entity and Parent in the Merger,
without further action, at the Effective Time and will survive the Merger and
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 



 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Existing
Partnership Agreement and the organizational documents of the Partnerships
Subsidiaries will contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation and limitations on
liability of directors and officers than are set forth in the Existing
Partnership Agreement, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who,
at or prior to the Effective Time, were Indemnified Parties, unless such
modification is required by Law and then only to the minimum extent required
by Law; _provided, however_ , that any such modification shall be prospective
only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any Claim
or Action involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or
omission to act that took place prior to modification; and _provided further_
that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or
asserted or

 



      
 

 



 

any Claim made within such period continue until the disposition of such
Action or resolution of such Claim.

 



 

(d) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent will maintain in
effect the current directors and officers liability and fiduciary liability
insurance policies covering the Indemnified Parties (but may substitute
therefor other policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing
terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties
so long as that substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage)
with respect to matters occurring on or before the Effective Time, but Parent
is not required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual
premiums paid therefor prior to the date of this Agreement (the " ** _Maximum
Amount_** ") and will purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be
obtained for that amount if the coverage described in this _Section 7.10(d)_
would cost in excess of that amount. If Parent elects, then Parent may, on or
prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail policy" with respect to acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time
that were committed or alleged to have been committed by such Indemnified
Parties in their capacity as such; _provided_ that in no event shall the cost
of such policy, if purchased by the Partnership, exceed six times the Maximum
Amount and, if such a "tail policy" is purchased, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Entity shall have any further obligations under this _Section
7.10(d)_.

 



 

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and is
not the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 7.10_.

 



 

(f) Parent will cause the Surviving Entity to perform all of the obligations
of the Surviving Entity under this _Section 7.10_.

 



 

(g) This _Section 7.10_ survives the consummation of the Transactions and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and to be enforceable by, the Indemnified
Parties and the Indemnitees and their respective heirs and personal
representatives, and will be binding on Parent, the Surviving Entity and their
respective successors and assigns.

 



 

 **7.11** ** ****_Notification of Certain Matters_**. The Partnership shall
give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Partnership, to the extent in each case it obtains Knowledge thereof, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such Party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent is
reasonably likely to be material to the Partnership or Parent, (b) any
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such Party or any of
its Subsidiaries and that relate to the Transactions and (c) any material
failure of such Party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it hereby that would result in the failure to
be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VIII_;
_provided_ that, in the

 



      
 

 



 

case of clause (c), the failure to comply with this _Section 7.11_ shall not
result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing
in _Article VIII_, or give rise to any right to terminate this Agreement
under _Article IX_, if the underlying fact, circumstance, event or failure
would not in and of itself give rise to such failure or right.

 



 

 **7.12** ** ****_Section 16 Matters_**. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Partnership will take all such steps as may be required (to the extent
permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Partnership
Common Units (including derivative securities with respect to Partnership
Common Units) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Partnership, or will become
subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

 **7.13** ** ****_Distributions_**. Each of the Partnership and Parent will
consult with the Other Party regarding the declaration and payment of
distributions in respect of Partnership Common Units, the Parent Common Units,
Parent Class B Units, and Parent Preferred Units occurring after the date of
this Agreement, and the record and payment dates relating thereto, to ensure
that no Partnership Unitholder receives two distributions, or fails to receive
one distribution, for any single calendar month or quarter, as applicable,
with respect to either (a) the Partnership Common Units or (b) the Parent
Common Units any such Partnership Unitholder will receive in exchange for
Partnership Common Units pursuant to the Merger.

 



 

 **7.14** ** ****_Transaction Litigation_**. The Partnership shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any security
holder litigation against the Partnership, Partnership GP or its respective
directors relating to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without the prior
written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. The Partnership GP and the Partnership shall
cooperate, the Partnership shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to cooperate,
and each of the Partnership GP and the Partnership shall use reasonable
commercial efforts to cause their respective Representatives to cooperate, in
the defense against such litigation.

 



 

 **7.15** ** ****_Financing Cooperation_**. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Partnership Entities shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives to, at Parents sole cost and expense,
provide all cooperation that is reasonably necessary, proper or advisable in
connection with any financing by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the Transactions as may be reasonably requested by Parent or
its Representatives. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Partnership Entities shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives
to, (i) furnish, as promptly as practicable, the report of the Partnerships
auditor on the most recently available audited consolidated financial
statements of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such auditor to the use of such
report in accordance with normal custom and practice, and use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such auditor to provide customary comfort letters
(providing "negative assurance" comfort) and drafts thereof to the
underwriters, administrative agent, lenders, initial purchasers or placement
agents, as applicable, in connection with such financing by Parent; (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to furnish, as promptly as practicable,

required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities
Act for a registered public offering to consummate any offering(s) of
securities contemplated by such financing; (iii) provide reasonable and
customary assistance in the preparation of one or more confidential
information memoranda, prospectuses, offering memoranda, private placement
memoranda and other marketing and syndication materials (including the
provision of authorization letters and a representation with respect to the
presence or absence of material non-public information) reasonably requested
by Parent, including by making available, at reasonable times and on
reasonable advance notice, employees and advisors of the Partnership Entities;
(iv) in a reasonable number of meetings, lender presentations, due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions and road shows, in each case, upon reasonable
advance notice and at mutually agreed times; (v) assisting Parent in
connection with the preparation and registration of (but not executing) any
pledge and security documents, currency or interest hedging arrangements,
other definitive financing documents, or documents as may be reasonably
requested by Parent or the Financing Sources or otherwise reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral in connection with the financing of
the Transactions (provided that such documents will not take effect until the
Effective Time); (vi) using commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any
syndication efforts benefit from existing lending and investment banking
relationships; and (vii) providing all customary documentation and other
information about the Partnership, the Partnership GP and their respective
Subsidiaries requested by Parent or the Financing Sources in connection with
the financing of the Transactions and required under applicable "know your
customer" sanctions and anti-money-laundering rules and regulations; provided
that (x) none of the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required
to pay any commitment or other fee or incur any other liability or obligation
in connection with such financing or to take any action that would be
prohibited by any applicable Law or cause a default of, or breach under, or
otherwise violate any Partnership Material Agreement, in each case except for
any payment, incurrence or action that is conditioned upon, and shall not take
effect until, the Effective Time, (y) no obligations of the Partnership or any
of its Subsidiaries under any certificate, opinion, contract, indenture or
other document or instrument delivered pursuant to this _Section 7.15_ shall
be effective until the Effective Time, and none of the Partnership or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action pursuant to this
_Section 7.15_ under any certificate, opinion, contract, indenture or other
document or instrument that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would
be effective prior to the Effective Time and (z) none of the Partnership or
its senior officers shall be required to engage in any action that would
interfere unreasonably with the business of the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries, Partnership GP and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement of any financing by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions and any information utilized
in connection therewith except (A) with respect to information supplied by the
Partnership, its Subsidiaries and Representatives specifically for inclusion
or incorporation by reference therein and/or (B) to the extent such losses and
damages arise from the willful misconduct of the Partnerships or any of its
Subsidiaries Representatives.

earlier date, in which case as of such date), except where the

 



      
 

 



 

failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct

 **ARTICLE IX 
TERMINATION**

 



 

 **9.1** ** ****_Termination of Agreement_**. This Agreement may be terminated
prior to the Closing as follows:

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Partnership and Parent;

 



 

(b) by the Partnership or Parent if there is in effect a final nonappealable
order of a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 9.1(b)_ is not available to the Partnership, on the one
hand, or Parent, on the other hand, if such order was primarily due to the
failure of any Partnership Entity, on the one hand, or any of Parent or Merger
Sub, on the other hand, to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement;

 



 

(c) by Parent if (i) any Partnership Entity has breached or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, or (ii) any representation or warranty of any Partnership
Entity becomes untrue, and, with respect to either _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_
above, which breach, failure to perform or untruth if it was continuing as of
the Closing Date would result in the failure of the conditions set forth in
_Sections 8.3(a)_ or _(b)_ to be satisfied and such breach, failure to
perform or untruth is incapable of being cured (or becoming true) or, if
capable of being cured (or becoming true), is not cured (or does not become
true) by the earlier of (x) the Outside Date or (y) within 30 days following
receipt by the Partnership of notice of such breach, failure or untruth from
Parent;

 



 

(d) by the Partnership if (i) Parent has breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, or (ii) any representation or warranty of Parent becomes untrue,
and, with respect to either _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ above, which breach,
failure to perform or untruth if it was continuing as of the Closing Date
would result in the failure of the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.2(a)_
or _(b)_ to be satisfied and such breach, failure to perform or untruth is
incapable of being cured (or becoming true) or, if capable of being cured (or
becoming true), is not cured (or does not become true) by the earlier of (x)
the Outside Date or (y) within 30 days following receipt by Parent of notice
of such breach, failure or untruth from the Partnership;

 



 

(e) by the Partnership or Parent if the Closing does not occur on or before
December 31, 2015 (the " ** _Outside Date_** "); _provided_ that such failure
of the Closing to occur is not due to the failure of such Party to perform and
comply in all material respects with the covenants and agreements to be
performed or complied with by such Party prior to the Closing;

 



       
 

 



 

(f) by the Partnership or Parent if, after the final adjournment of the
Partnership Meeting at which a vote of the Partnership Unitholders has been
taken in accordance with this Agreement, the Partnership Unitholder Approval
has not been obtained;

 



 

(g) by Parent prior to final adjournment of the Partnership Meeting, if a
Partnership Change in Recommendation has occurred; or

 



 

(h) by the Partnership, if this Agreement is terminated to enter into a
definitive agreement relating to a Superior Proposal in accordance with
_Section 7.3_, _provided_ that the Partnership has complied with _Section
9.4(d)_.

 



 

 **9.2** ** ****_Procedure Upon Termination_**. In the event of termination of
this Agreement by Parent or the Partnership, or both, pursuant to _Section
9.1_, written notice thereof will forthwith be given to the Other Party or
Parties, and this Agreement will terminate without further action by Parent or
the Partnership.

 



 

 **9.3** ** ****_Effect of Termination_**. In the event that this Agreement is
validly terminated as provided in _Section 9.1_, then each of the Parties
will be relieved of its duties and obligations arising under this Agreement
after the date of such termination and such termination will be without
liability to Parent or the Partnership; _provided_ , that the agreements and
obligations of the Parties set forth in _Section 7.6_, this _Section 9.3_,
_Section 9.4_ and _Article X_ hereof will survive any such termination and
are enforceable hereunder; _provided further_ , that nothing in this _Section
9.3_ relieves any of Parent or the Partnership of any liability for fraud or
any Willful Breach of any covenant or agreement contained herein occurring
prior to termination, or as provided in the Confidentiality Agreement, in
which case the aggrieved Party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies
available at law or in equity (including, in the case of Parent, liability for
damages based on the consideration that would have otherwise been payable to
the holders of Partnership Units). " ** _Willful Breach_** " means an
intentional and willful material breach, or an intentional and willful
material failure to perform, in each case that is the consequence of an act or
omission by a Party with the Knowledge that the taking of, or failure to take,
such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause a material breach of
this Agreement.

 



 

 **9.4** ** ****_Fees and Expenses_**.

 



 

(a) In the event that (i) an Alternative Proposal is publicly submitted,
publicly proposed or publicly disclosed prior to, and not withdrawn at the
time of, the date of the Partnership Meeting (or, if the Partnership Meeting
has not occurred, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1(e)_), (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Partnership or
Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_, _Section 9.1(e)_ or _Section 9.1(f)_,
and (iii) the Partnership enters into a definitive agreement with respect to,
or consummates, an Alternative Proposal within 12 months after the date this
Agreement is terminated, then the Partnership will pay to Parent the
Termination Fee, upon the earlier of the public announcement that the
Partnership has entered into such definitive agreement or the consummation of
any such transaction. For purposes of this _Section 9.4(a)_, the term
"Alternative Proposal" has the meaning assigned to such term in _Section
7.3(i)(i)_, except that the references to "20% or more" are deemed to be
references to "50% or more."

 



      
 

 



 

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.1(c)_ or (ii) by the Partnership pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_, in
each of cases (i) and (ii), the non-terminating party will pay the terminating
party, within two Business Days after the date of termination, the terminating
Partys Expenses.

 



 

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
9.1(g)_, then the Partnership will pay to Parent, within two Business Days
after the date of termination, the Termination Fee.

 



 

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Partnership pursuant to
_Section 9.1(h)_, then the Partnership will immediately prior to or
simultaneously with such termination pay to Parent the Termination Fee.

 



 

(e) Any payment of the Termination Fee or Expenses will be made in cash by
wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated in writing by the
recipient of such payment.

 



 

(f) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the provisions of this _Section
9.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and that,
without these agreements, the Other Party or Other Parties would not enter
into this Agreement. The Parties agree that in the event that the Partnership
pays the Termination Fee to Parent, the Partnership has no further liability
to Parent of any kind in respect of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(g) As used herein, " ** _Termination Fee_** " means a cash amount equal to
$7,288,000.00.

 



 

(h) As used herein, " ** _Expenses_** " means the reasonable and documented
out of pocket attorneys fees and all other costs and expenses incurred and
paid by or on behalf of the Partnership or Parent, as applicable, to any third
party in connection with the review, evaluation, negotiation, documentation
and performance of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ that in no event shall the Expenses exceed
$1,215,000.00.

 



 

(i) In no event shall Parent be entitled to more than one payment of the
Termination Fee in connection with this Agreement pursuant to which the
Termination Fee is payable, and if the Termination Fee is payable at such time
as Parent has already received payment or concurrently receives payment from
the Partnership in respect of Parents Expenses, the Termination Fee shall be
reduced by the amount of such Expenses actually received by Parent.

 



 

(j) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, including in this _Section
9.4(j)_, each Party shall pay its own expenses incident to preparing for,
entering into and carrying out this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that Parent and the
Partnership shall each bear and pay one half of (i) the fees payable in
connection with the filings required to be made under the HSR Act and (ii) the
expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the
Registration Statement and Proxy Statement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE X 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

 **10.1** ** ****_Amendment or Supplement_**. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all
respects, whether before or after receipt of the Partnership Unitholder
Approval, by written agreement of the Parties hereto, by action taken or
authorized by their respective boards of directors; _provided, however_ , that
following receipt of the Partnership Unitholder Approval, there will be no
amendment or change to the provisions of this Agreement that by Law would
require further approval by the Partnership Unitholders without such approval.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in addition to any other approvals required by
the Partnerships or Partnership GPs constituent documents or under this

action by the Partnership Board or Partnership GP. Further, unless otherwise

GP is required pursuant to this Agreement, such determination, decision,
approval or consent must be authorized by the Conflicts Committee.

or unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions of
this Agreement in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision
of this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

 **10.8** ** ****_Jurisdiction_**.

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware or, if such Court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware or, if jurisdiction
is vested exclusively in the Federal courts of the United States, the Federal
courts of the United States sitting in the State of Delaware, and any
appellate court from any such state or Federal court, and hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agree that all claims with respect to any such claim shall
be heard and determined in such Delaware court or in such Federal court, as
applicable. The Parties agree that a final judgment in any such claim is
conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related matter in any
Delaware state or Federal court located in the State of Delaware and the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such claim in any such
court.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Each of the Parties agrees that it will not, and it will not permit any of
its controlled Affiliates to, bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any
Financing Source or any Finance Related Party, in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York or, if such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, in any state court located in the Borough of Manhattan (and the
Parties hereto agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in,
such court in connection therewith), and that the provisions of _Section
10.9_ relating to waiver of jury trial shall apply to such action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim.

 



 

 **10.9** ** ****_Waiver of Jury Trial_**. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY
APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND
COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR
OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE,
CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER,
RELATED TO, BASED ON, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT
MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING
IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE. ANY PARTY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART
OR A COPY OF THIS _SECTION 10.9_ WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE
CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 



 

 **10.10** ** ****_No Recourse_** _._ This Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out
of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance
of this Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly
identified as Parties hereto and no past, present or future Affiliate,
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner,
stockholder, agent, attorney or representative of any Party hereto has any
liability for any obligations or liabilities of the Parties or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

 **10.11** ** ****_Specific Performance_**. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
and it is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in
accordance with this _Section 10.11_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any
state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the
basis that (a) each Party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Each Party further agrees that no Party shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred

 



      
 

 



 

to in this _Section 10.11_, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it
may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument.

 



 

 **10.12** ** ****_Survival_**. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, none of the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants
contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing or the termination of
this Agreement if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing;
_provided, however_ , that if the Closing occurs, the agreements of the
Parties in _Sections 3.3_, _3.4_ , _3.5_ , _7.10_ , _7.14_ and _Article X_
will survive the Closing, and if this Agreement is terminated prior to the
Closing, the agreements of the Parties in _Sections 7.6_, _9.2_ , _9.3_ and
_9.4_ , and this _Article X_ will survive such termination. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall (a) survive termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms and (b) terminate as of the Effective Time.

 



 

 **10.13** ** ****_No Recourse to Financing Sources_**. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Partnership Entities agree, on behalf of
themselves and each of their former, current or future officers, directors,
managers, employees, members, partners, Partnership Unitholders, agents and
other representatives and controlled Affiliates (the " ** _Partnership
Parties_** ") that Parents and Merger Subs financial institutions and their
respective Affiliates (collectively " ** _Financing Sources_** "), and each of
their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, agents, representatives and Affiliates, and
each of their successors and assigns (collectively, " ** _Finance Related
Parties_** ") shall not be subject to any liability or claims to the
Partnership Parties in connection with the financing of or in any way relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (a) no amendment or modification
to _Section 10.6(c)_, _Section 10.8(c)_ or this _Section 10.13_ (or
amendment or modification with respect to any related definitions as they
affect _Section 10.6(c)_, _Section 10.8(c)_ or this _Section 10.13_) shall
be effective without the prior written consent of each Financing Source (on
behalf of themselves and the applicable Finance Related Parties) and (b) each
Financing Source and Finance Related Party shall be an express third party
beneficiary of, and shall have the right to enforce, the second paragraph of
_Section 10.6(c)_, _Section 10.8(c)_ or this _Section 10.13_ and any other
claims or actions against any of the Financing Sources in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the financing
or the performance thereof. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that _Section
10.3_ notwithstanding, this _Section 10.13_ shall be interpreted and any
action relating to this provision shall be governed by the laws of the State
of New York.

 ** _Exhibit A_**

 



 

 **TERMINATION AND CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS AGREEMENT**

 



 

This TERMINATION AND CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS AGREEMENT, dated [*] (this " **
_Agreement_** "), is entered into by and among Vanguard Natural Resources,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" ** _Parent_** "), Lime Rock
Management LP, a Delaware limited partnership (" ** _Management_** "), Lime
Rock Resources A, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" ** _LRR A_** "),

Delaware limited liability company and the ultimate general partner of each
Fund Entity (the " ** _Fund General Partner_** "), LRR Energy, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership (the " ** _Partnership_** "), LRE GP, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (the " ** _Partnership GP_** "), and LRE
Operating, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned
subsidiary of the Partnership (" ** _OLLC_** "). The parties to this Agreement
are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the " ** _parties_** ," and
individually as a " ** _party_**." Capitalized terms used herein without
definition shall have the respective meanings specified in the Merger
Agreement (as defined below).

 



 

WHEREAS, this Agreement is made in connection with the Purchase Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the " ** _Merger Agreement_** "), dated as of April 20, 2015,
by and among Parent, Lighthouse Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" ** _Merger Sub_** "), the
Fund Entities, Lime Rock Resources II-A, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership,
Lime Rock Resources II-C, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, Management,
the Partnership and the Partnership GP, pursuant to which, among other things,
on the date hereof (i) Parent will purchase all of the outstanding membership
interests in Partnership GP, and (ii) Merger Sub will be merged with and into
the Partnership, with the Partnership surviving as a wholly owned, directly
and indirectly, Subsidiary of Parent, all upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (the " ** _Merger_** ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties hereto have determined that, in connection with the
Merger, it is advisable and in each of their respective best interests to
terminate the Omnibus Agreement, entered into, and effective as of, November
16, 2011, by and among the Partnership, the Partnership GP, OLLC, the Fund
Entities, the Fund General Partner and Management (the " ** _LRR Omnibus
Agreement_** "), but to retain the Fund Entities certain surviving
indemnification obligations, by entering into this Agreement;

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, intending to be
legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE II**

 

 **TERMINATION OF LRR OMNIBUS AGREEMENT**

 



 

 **2.1** ** ****_Termination_**. Subject to the provisions of _Article II_,
the parties hereto agree that, effective as of the date hereof, the LRR
Omnibus Agreement shall be terminated and that

 



      
 

 



 

the parties thereto and any other Person that could be bound by the LRR
Omnibus Agreement are released from all of their respective duties,
obligations and liabilities arising thereunder and are no longer entitled to
any of their respective rights or benefits to the extent arising solely
thereunder, whether arising before or after the date hereof.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

 

 **PAYMENT; CONTINUING INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

 **3.1** ** ****_Indemnification_**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in _Article I_, and subject to the provisions of _Section 2.2_ and _Section
2.3_, effective as of the date hereof, each Fund Entity, severally, in
proportion to its respective Property Contributor Percentage (as defined in
the LRR Omnibus Agreement), agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Partnership, the Partnership GP, OLLC and all of their respective Subsidiaries
(the " ** _Partnership Group_** ") from and against any and all losses,
damages, liabilities, claims, demands, causes of action, judgments,
settlements, fines, penalties, costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, any court costs and reasonable attorneys and experts fees) of
any and every kind and character suffered or incurred by the Partnership Group
by reason of or arising out of any federal, state or local income tax
liabilities attributable to the ownership or operation of the MLP Assets (as
defined in the LRR Omnibus Agreement) prior to the closing of the
Partnerships initial public offering (the " ** _Partnership IPO Closing
Date_** "), including any such income tax liabilities that may result from the
consummation of the formation transactions for any member of the Partnership
Group occurring on or prior to the Partnership IPO Closing Date.

 



 

 **3.2** ** ****_Limitations Regarding Indemnification_**.

 



 

(a) The indemnification obligations of the Fund Entities set forth in _Section
2.1_ shall survive until the first anniversary of the Closing Date (as defined
in the Merger Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
indemnification obligation pursuant to _Section 2.1_ shall remain in full
force and effect thereafter only with respect to any bona fide claim made
thereunder prior to such expiration and then only for such period as may be
necessary for the resolution thereof.

 



 

(b) No claims may be made against the Fund Entities for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ unless the aggregate dollar amount of the Material
Losses suffered or incurred by the Partnership Group exceed $500,000;
thereafter, each Fund Entity shall be liable, severally, in proportion to its
respective Property Contributor Percentage, to the extent and only to the
extent that such claims exceed $500,000 in the aggregate. The term " **
_Material Losses_** " means only each of those Losses described in _Section
2.1_ that exceeds $50,000.

 



 

 **3.3** ** ****_Indemnification Procedures_**.

 



 

(a) Each Party seeking indemnification (each, an " ** _Indemnified Party_** ")
pursuant to this _Article II_ agrees that within a reasonable period of time
after it becomes aware of facts giving rise to a claim for indemnification
pursuant to this _Article II_, it will provide notice thereof in writing to
the Parties from whom indemnification is sought pursuant to this _Article II_
(each, an " ** _Indemnifying Party_** ") specifying the nature of and specific
basis for such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Indemnified Party shall
submit claims more frequently than once a calendar quarter (or twice in the
case of the last calendar quarter prior to the expiration of the applicable

 



      
 

 



 

indemnity coverage under this Agreement); _provided further_ , that failure to
timely provide such notice shall not affect the right of the Indemnified
Partys indemnification hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
is materially prejudiced by such delay or omission.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to control all aspects of the
defense of (and any counterclaims with respect to) any claims brought against
the Indemnified Party that are covered by the indemnification set forth in
this _Article II_, including, without limitation, the selection of counsel
(provided that such counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Parties), determination of whether to appeal any decision of any court and the
settling of any such matter or any issues relating thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such settlement shall be entered into without the consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of
the Indemnified Parties unless it includes a full release of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective Subsidiaries from such matter or issues, as the
case may be.

 



 

(c) The Indemnified Parties agree to cooperate fully with the Indemnifying
Parties with respect to all aspects of the defense of any claims covered by
the indemnification set forth in this _Article II_, including, without
limitation, the prompt furnishing to the Indemnifying Parties of any
correspondence or other notice relating thereto that the Indemnified Parties
may receive, permitting the names of the Indemnified Parties to be utilized in
connection with such defense, the making available to the Indemnifying Parties
of any files, records or other information of the Indemnified Parties that the
Indemnifying Parties consider relevant to such defense and the making
available to the Indemnifying Parties of any employees of the Indemnified
Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that in connection therewith the
Indemnifying Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize
the impact thereof on the operations of the Indemnified Parties and further
agree to reasonably maintain the confidentiality of all files, records and
other information furnished by the Indemnified Parties pursuant to this
_Section 2.3_. In no event shall the obligation of the Indemnified Parties to
cooperate with the Indemnifying Parties as set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence be construed as imposing upon the Indemnified Parties an
obligation to hire and pay for counsel in connection with the defense of any
claims covered by the indemnification set forth in this _Article II_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Parties may, at their option,
cost and expense, hire and pay for counsel in connection with any such
defense. The Indemnifying Parties agree to keep any such counsel hired by the
Indemnified Parties reasonably informed as to the status of any such defense,
but the Indemnifying Parties shall have the right to retain sole control over
such defense.

 



 

(d) In determining the amount of any Losses for which the Indemnified Parties
are entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the gross amount of the
indemnification will be reduced by (i) any insurance proceeds realized by the
Indemnified Parties, and such correlative insurance benefit shall be net of
any incremental insurance premium that becomes due and payable by the
Indemnified Parties as a result of such claim and (ii) all amounts recovered
by the Indemnified Parties under contractual indemnities from third parties.
The Indemnified Parties hereby agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
realize any applicable insurance proceeds or amounts recoverable under such
contractual indemnities; _provided_ , _however_ , that the costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees) of
the Indemnified Parties in connection with such efforts shall be promptly
reimbursed by the Indemnifying Parties. To the extent that the Indemnifying
Parties have made

 



      
 

 



 

any indemnification payment hereunder in respect of a claim for which the
Indemnified Parties have asserted a related claim for insurance proceeds or
under a contractual indemnity, the Indemnifying Parties shall be subrogated to
the rights of the Indemnified Parties to receive the proceeds of such
insurance or contractual indemnity.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 **4.3** ** ****_Amendments; Waivers_**. Any provision of this Agreement may
be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing
and signed (i) in the case of an amendment, by all of the parties hereto, and
(ii) in the case of a waiver, by the party (or parties) against whom the

 **4.4** ** ****_Assignment_**. No party to this Agreement may assign any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement, including by sale of stock,
operation of law in connection with a merger or sale of substantially all the
assets of such party, without the prior written consent of the other parties

 **4.5** ** ****_No Partnership, Agency, or Joint Venture_**. This Agreement
is intended to create, and creates, a contractual relationship and is not
intended to create, and does not create, any agency, partnership, joint
venture or any like relationship between the parties hereto.

 



 

 **4.6** ** ****_Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement together with the Merger

Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement and understanding of
the parties hereto with respect to the matters therein and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings on such matters.

 



 

 **4.7** ** ****_No Third-Party Beneficiaries_**. Subject to _Section 3.4_,
the provisions of this Agreement are binding upon, and inure to the benefit
of, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and no
provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,

 



      
 

 



 

benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors.

 



 

 **4.8** ** ****_Jurisdiction; Specific Performance; Waiver of Jury Trial_**.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such Court does not have subject
matter jurisdiction, to the Superior Court of the State of Delaware or, if
jurisdiction is vested exclusively in the Federal courts of the United States,
the Federal courts of the United States sitting in the State of Delaware, and
any appellate court from any such state or Federal court, and hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally agree that all claims with respect to any such
claim shall be heard and determined in such Delaware court or in such Federal
court, as applicable. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any
such claim is conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each of the parties
hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or any related matter in any Delaware state or
Federal court located in the State of Delaware and the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such claim in any such court.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the
parties hereto would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is accordingly agreed
that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the parties hereto shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in
each case, in accordance with this _Section 3.8_ in the Delaware Court of
Chancery or any state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, each of the parties hereto
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that
(i) any party hereto has an adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Each party hereto further agrees that no other party hereto shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
_Section 3.8(b)_, and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right it may
have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument.

 



 

(c) TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH
PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT
(WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION
ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED TO, BASED ON, OR IN CONNECTION
WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR
HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE. ANY
PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS _SECTION
3.8(c)_ WITH ANY COURT

 



      
 

 



 

AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 



 

 **4.9** ** ****_Governing Law_**. This Agreement is governed by and construed
and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would result in the
applicable of any Law other than the Law of the State of Delaware.
