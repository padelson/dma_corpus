-vii- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 28, 2015 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and between Astoria Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
" _Company_ "), and New York Community Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(" _Parent_ ").

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
stockholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
provided for herein, pursuant to which the Company will, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Parent (the " _Merger_
"), so that Parent is the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes
referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") in the
Merger; and

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and
this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of
reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at the
Effective Time, the Company shall merge with and into Parent. Parent shall be
the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. Upon consummation of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall terminate.

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m. New
York City time at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, on a date
which shall be no later than five (5) business days after the satisfaction or
waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions
set forth in Article VII hereof (other than those conditions that by their
nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction
or waiver thereof), unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties (the "
_Closing Date_ ").

1.3  _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
certificate of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (the

 



-1-  " _Delaware Secretary_ ") on the Closing Date (the " _Certificate of Merger_
"). The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the
Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Certificate of Merger.

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

1.5 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the
holder of any of the following securities:

 

(a) Subject to Section 2.2(e) and Section 2.3, each share of the common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), except for
shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company as treasury stock or owned
by the Company or Parent (in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency
capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted), shall be converted
into the right to receive (i) one (1) share (the " _Exchange Ratio_ " of the
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common
Stock_ ") and (ii) $0.50 in cash without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_
") (such consideration set forth in clauses (i) and (ii), the "
_Merger Consideration_ "); it being understood that upon the Effective Time,
pursuant to Section 1.6, the Parent Common Stock, including the shares issued
to former holders of Company Common Stock, shall be the common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ ", it
being understood that any reference herein to " _Certificate_ " shall be
deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) previously representing any
such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive (i) a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock which such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted
into the right to receive, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been
converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.5 and Section
2.2(e), without any interest thereon, (iii) the Cash Consideration and (iv)
any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.2. Certificates previously representing shares
of Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing
whole shares of Parent Common Stock (together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu of fractional shares
issued in consideration therefor) and the Cash Consideration upon the
surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without any
interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been increased,
decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares
or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary
dividend or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be
made to the Exchange Ratio.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the
Company or Parent (in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity
or as a result of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist and no stock of Parent or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 



-2- 1.6 _Parent Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 

1.7 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock under a Company Stock Plan, whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") shall become fully vested and be
cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of (i) the product of (A)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option _multiplied by_ (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Stock
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of
such Company Stock Option, _divided by_ (ii) the Parent Share Closing Price.
The Surviving Corporation shall issue the consideration described in this
Section 1.7(a), less applicable tax withholdings, within five (5) business
days following the Closing Date. Any Company Stock Option that has an exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the

Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under

prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Restricted Stock Award_ ") shall
fully vest (with any performance-based vesting condition applicable to such
Company Restricted Stock Award deemed to have been fully achieved (or achieved
at the target level if more than one level of achievement has been
contemplated)) and be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common
Stock underlying such Company Restricted Stock Award. The
Surviving Corporation shall issue the consideration described in this Section
1.7(b) (together with any accrued but unpaid dividends corresponding to the
Company Restricted Stock Awards that vest in accordance with this Section
1.7(b)), less applicable tax withholdings, within five (5) business days
following the Closing Date.

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Restricted

Awards, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") shall fully vest (with any
performance-based vesting condition applicable to such Company Restricted
Stock Unit Award deemed to have been fully achieved (or achieved at the target
level if more than one level of achievement has been contemplated)) and shall
be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock underlying such
Company Restricted Stock Unit Award, less applicable tax withholdings. The
Surviving Corporation shall issue the consideration described in this Section
1.7(c) (together any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents corresponding to
the Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards that vest in accordance with this
Section 1.7(c)), less applicable tax withholdings, within five (5) business
days following the Closing Date.

Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

1.9 _Bylaws of Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of
Parent (the " _Parent Bylaws_ "), as in effect immediately prior to the

a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that

ARTICLE II

 

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1  _Parent to Make Merger Consideration Available_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an
exchange agent designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates,
for exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates or, at Parents
option, evidence of shares in book entry form (collectively, referred to
herein as " _certificates_ "), representing the shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued to holders of Company Common Stock, an amount in cash sufficient
to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration payable to holders of Company Common
Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and certificates
for shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "), to be issued pursuant to Section 1.5 and paid pursuant to
Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

 



-5- 2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than ten (10) days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each holder of record of one or more Certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock, the Cash Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted into the right to
receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions
to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Upon proper surrender of a Certificate
or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder
of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder of Company Common Stock
shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a
check representing the amount of (A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares
which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or
Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, (B)
the Cash Consideration and (C) any dividends or distributions which the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to this Section 2.2, and the
Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares
payable to holders of Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate have been converted into the right to receive,
the Cash Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in
respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the
holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this
Article II. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent
Common Stock which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive.

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to
be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered in

 



-6-  exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer)
and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other
similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or required
for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in this
Article II.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or
distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with
respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of
Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay
to each former stockholder of the Company who otherwise would be entitled to
receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent)
determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale prices of Parent
Common Stock on The New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") as reported by
_The Wall Street Journal_ for the five (5) full trading days ending on the
day preceding the Closing Date (the " _Parent Share Closing Price_ ") by (ii)
the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of the
Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the shares of
Parent Common Stock, the Cash Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional
shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each former share of Company Common Stock such
stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other
person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock
for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(g) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, any dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any other consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company 

 



-7-  Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the
appropriate governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company
Common Stock in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common
Stock, the Cash Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised appraisal
rights in respect of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(such shares being referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ "
until such time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses
such holders appraisal rights under applicable law with respect to such
shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of such
consideration as may be determined to be due in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL; provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company Common Stock
shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.5,
without interest thereon, upon surrender of such shares of Company Common
Stock.

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal, of any withdrawals of such demands and of any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or
compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any such appraisal demands.

 



-8- ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

 

Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the Company
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect
and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of Article III shall
be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of Article III
specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of Article
III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the
absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that
such disclosure applies to such other sections, (b) as disclosed in any
Company Reports filed by the Company after January 1, 2014 and prior to the
date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the
heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-
looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-
specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), or (c) for
information and documents commonly known as "confidential supervisory
information" that is prohibited from disclosure (and as to which nothing in
this Agreement shall require disclosure), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent as follows:

 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, is a savings and loan
holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners Loan Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _HOLA_ "), and is duly registered with the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System (the " _Federal Reserve Board_ "). The Company
has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location
of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a
material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, results of operations
or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (
_provided_ , that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect
shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date
hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or
applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date
hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability to companies in
the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or
interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes,
after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions
(including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or

 



-9-  market (including equity, credit and debt markets, as well as changes in
interest rates) conditions affecting the financial services industry generally
and not specifically relating to such party or its Subsidiaries, (D) public
disclosure of the execution of this Agreement, public disclosure or
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including any effect on
a partys relationships with its customers or employees) or actions expressly
required by this Agreement in contemplation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (E) a decline in the trading price of a partys common stock or the
failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings projections or internal financial
forecasts (it being understood that the underlying cause of such decline or
failure may be taken into account in determining whether a Material Adverse
Effect has occurred) or (F) the expenses incurred by the Company or Parent
in negotiating, documenting, effecting and consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B),
or (C), to the extent that the effects of such change are materially
disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities,
results of operations or financial condition of such party and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the industry
in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the ability of such
party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in
this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to the
Company, shall have the meaning ascribed to it in Section 10(a)(1)(G) of
HOLA, and when used with respect to Parent, shall have the meaning ascribed to
it in Section 2(d) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "
_BHC Act_ "). True and complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Company (the " _Company Certificate_ ") and the Restated By-Laws of the
Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have previously been made available by the Company to Parent.

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company (a " _Company Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (iii) has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any
Subsidiary of the Company to pay dividends or distributions except, in the
case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends
or distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The
deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of the Company that is an insured
depository institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest
extent permitted by law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in
connection therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the
termination of such insurance are pending or threatened. Section 3.1(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all
Subsidiaries of the Company as of the date hereof.

thereof. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have
the right to vote on any matters on which stockholders of the Company may
vote. No trust preferred or subordinated debt securities of the Company are
issued or outstanding. Other than Company Stock Options and Company
Restricted Stock Unit Awards, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other
commitments or agreements obligating the Company to issue, transfer, sell,
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, any such securities. There are no
voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect
with respect to the voting or transfer of the Company Common Stock or other
equity interests of Company.

(b) The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of
each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges,
charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all
of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid, nonassessable (except, with respect to bank
Subsidiaries, as provided under 12 U.S.C. §55 or any comparable provision
applicable to federal savings associations or of applicable state law) and
free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the
ownership thereof. No Company Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of
any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities
representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary.

(c) Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of
October 26, 2015, a true, correct and complete list of all Company Stock
Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards and Company Restricted Stock Unit
Awards outstanding as of the date hereof specifying, on a holder-by-

to each such Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Stock Award and Company
Restricted Stock Unit Award, (iii) the grant date of each such Company Stock

and the availability of equitable remedies (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_
")).

Certificate or the Company Bylaws or (ii) assuming that the consents and
approvals referred to in Section 3.4 are duly obtained, (x) violate any

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of
clause (y) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults which,

to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

entity, or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due
and payable in connection therewith, except where the failure to file such
report, registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either

Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as set forth on Section 3.5 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule and for normal examinations conducted by a
Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of business of the Company and its

the SEC by the Company since December 31, 2013 pursuant to the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), or the Exchange Act (the "
_Company Reports_ ") is publicly available. No such Company Report, as of the
date thereof (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy
statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant
meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed or

executive officer of the Company has failed in any respect to make the
certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "). As of the date of

(a) The financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Company Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash
flows, changes in stockholders equity and consolidated financial position of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of

amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC,
in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv)
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in
the notes thereto. The books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance
with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and
reflect only actual transactions. KPMG LLP has not resigned (or informed the
Company that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public
accountants of the Company as a result of or in connection with any
disagreements with the Company on a matter of accounting principles
or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) required
by GAAP to be included on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company, except
for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company included in its Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015 (including any notes
thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since June 30, 2015, or in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



-14- (c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that, either individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
Company (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) to ensure that material information
relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the
chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of the Company by
others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the Companys Board
of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information, and (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no reason to believe that
the Companys outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(d) Since January 1, 2013, (i) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer,
auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-
offs and accruals) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no
attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents to the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof or to
the knowledge of the Company, to any director or officer of the Company.

or challenging the validity or propriety of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction

reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

this Agreement, " _Controlled Group Liability_ " means any and all
liabilities (1) under Title IV of ERISA, (2) under Section 302 of ERISA, (3)

(h) All contributions required to be made to any Company Benefit Plan by
applicable law or by any plan document, and all premiums due or payable with
respect to insurance policies funding any Company Benefit Plan, for any period
through the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the
extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have
been fully reflected on the books and records of the Company, except as,
either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
result in any material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(i) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or
instituted, and, to the Companys knowledge, no set of circumstances exists
that may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against
the Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their
duties to the Company Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under
any of the Company Benefit Plans, except as, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery
of, cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to transfer or set aside any
assets to fund any material benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, or
increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit to any
employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
result in any limitation on the right of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from
any Company Benefit Plan or related trust. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in
the form of benefits) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof
or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event)
will be an

 



-19-  "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any plan,
program, agreement or arrangement that provides for the gross-up or
reimbursement of Taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (or any
corresponding provisions of state or local law relating to Tax).

 

(k) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened

material labor disputes against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

union or other group seeking to represent any employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

 

3.12 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries hold, and have at all times since December 31, 2013, held, all
licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses and ownership of their respective
properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all
fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where
neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such
license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees
or assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary
license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with and are
not in material default or violation under any applicable law, statute, order,

involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the
notes thereto. The books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been,
and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and
any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only
actual transactions. KMPG has not resigned (or informed Parent that it intends
to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of Parent as a
result of or in connection with any disagreements with Parent on a matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or
auditing scope or procedure.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any liability (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) required by GAAP to
be included on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent, except for those
liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance
sheet of Parent included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the

transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means

of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent (x) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within
those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed, based

ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and
(ii) to the knowledge of Parent, any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents
internal controls over financial reporting. To the knowledge of Parent, there
is no reason to believe that Parents outside auditors and its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules
and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
without qualification, when next due.

practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices,
and (ii) no attorney representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
or not employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of
a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar

occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified

through the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the
extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have
been fully reflected on the books and records of Parent, except as, either

in any material liability to Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 



-35- (h) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or
instituted, and, to Parents knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that
may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the

Parent or and its Subsidiaries.

franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses and ownership of their respective properties,

and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where
neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such

or assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and, to the knowledge of
Parent, no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license,
franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. Parent and each of its

ARTICLE VI

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.1  _Regulatory Matters_.

(a) Parent and the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC, no
later than thirty (30) business days after the date of this Agreement, the
Joint Proxy Statement and Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC
the S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus.
The S-4 shall also, to the extent required under the Securities Act and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, register the shares of Parent Series A
Preferred Stock and depositary shares representing one fortieth of an interest
in a share of Parent Series A Preferred Stock that will be issued in the
transaction. Each of Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best
efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the S-4 effective
for so long as necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and Parent and the Company shall thereafter as promptly as
practicable mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to their respective
stockholders. Parent shall also use its

 



-43-  reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or
"Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

 

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the
terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, as soon as practicable and in no event later than
thirty (30) business days after the date of this Agreement, Parent and the
Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, each prepare
and file any applications, notices and filings required to be filed with any
bank regulatory agency in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals.
Parent and the Company shall each use, and shall each cause their applicable
Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to obtain each such Requisite
Regulatory Approval as promptly as reasonably practicable. Parent and the
Company shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information
relating to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with
each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters
relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party
shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the
other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meetings and conferences.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of,
or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or the
Company to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any
condition or restriction that would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, after giving effect to the Merger (a " _Materially Burdensome
Regulatory Condition_ "). 

(d) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders and

 



-44-  such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice
or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(e) To the extent permitted by applicable law, Parent and the Company shall
promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any
Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to
believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory
Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be
materially delayed. As used in this Agreement, the " _Requisite Regulatory
Approvals_ " shall mean all regulatory authorizations, consents, orders or
approvals from (x) the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the DFS and (y) any
other approvals set forth in Sections 3.4 and 4.4 that are necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger and the Bank Merger, except for any such authorizations, consents,
orders or approvals the failure of which to be obtained would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Surviving Corporation. 

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of Parent and
the Company, for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties
of the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated
by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party, access,
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to
all its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel, information
technology systems, and records, and each shall cooperate with the other
party in preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or
consolidation of systems and business operations generally, and, during such
period, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or
federal or state banking laws (other than reports or documents that Parent or
the Company, as the case may be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable
law), and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties
and personnel as such party may reasonably request. Neither Parent nor the
Company nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide
access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would
violate or prejudice the rights of Parents or the Companys, as the case may
be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in
possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to
the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.

 



-45- (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall hold all information furnished by or
on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated October 8, 2015, between Parent and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

6.3 _Stockholders  Approvals_. Each of Parent and the Company shall call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Parent
Meeting_ " and the " _Company Meeting_ ," respectively) as soon as reasonably
practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite Company Vote and the Requisite Parent Vote required in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger and, if so desired and mutually
agreed, upon other matters of the type customarily brought before an annual
or special meeting of stockholders to adopt a merger agreement. The Board of
Directors of each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain from the stockholders of Parent and the Company, as
the case may be, the Requisite Parent Vote, in the case of Parent, and the
Requisite Company Vote, in the case of the Company, including by communicating
to its respective stockholders its recommendation (and including such
recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that they adopt and approve this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. However, subject to
Sections 8.1 and 8.2, if the Board of Directors of the Company or Parent,
after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that it
would be more likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties
under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then
in submitting this Agreement to its stockholders, such Board of Directors may
(but shall not be required to) submit this Agreement to its stockholders
without recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as
of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board
of Directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its
stockholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto to the extent required by law; _provided_ , that neither
Board of Directors may take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it
gives the other party at least three (3) business days prior written notice
of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the
event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action
(including, in the event such action is taken by the Board of Directors of the
Company in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and
conditions of, and the identity of the third party making, any such
Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in
reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (ii) at the end
of such notice period, the applicable Board of Directors takes into account
any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by the other party
and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that it
would nevertheless be more likely than not to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to

 



-46-  recommend this Agreement. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal
will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section
6.3 and will require a new notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3.
Parent or the Company shall adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting or the
Company Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for which such meeting
is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock
or the Company Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person
or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting, or if on the date of such meeting the Company or Parent, as
applicable, has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote or the Requisite Parent
Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with its terms, each of the Parent Meeting
and Company Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to
the stockholders of each of Parent and the Company at the Parent Meeting and
the Company Meeting, respectively, for the purpose of voting on the adoption
of this Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve either Parent or the Company of
such obligation. Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cooperate to hold the Company Meeting and the Parent Meeting on the
same day and at the same time as soon as reasonably practicable after the date
of this Agreement, and to set the same record date for each such meeting.

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of
this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all
legal and regulatory requirements that may be imposed on such party or its
Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to
the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the
other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval
of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party
that is required to be obtained by the Company or Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5  _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 

6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to
be employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries) immediately following the Effective Time for so long as
such employee is employed following the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") with (i) a base salary or base wage rate, as
applicable, that is no less favorable than the base salary or base wage rate,
as applicable, provided by the Company or any such Subsidiary to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an annual
short-term cash incentive opportunity that is substantially comparable to
the annual short-term cash incentive opportunity provided

 



-47-  by the Company or any such Subsidiary to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) other compensation,
including long-term incentive opportunities, and employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to either (A) the other
compensation, including long-term incentive opportunities, and employee
benefits provided by the Company or any such Subsidiary to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time or (B) the other
compensation, including long-term incentive opportunities, and employee
benefits provided by Parent to similarly situated employees of Parent. Without
limiting the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to, provide to each
Continuing Employee whose employment terminates during the 12-month period
following the Closing Date with severance benefits equal to the greater of
(A) the severance benefits for which such Continuing Employee was eligible
immediately prior to the Closing under the applicable Company Benefit Plan set
forth in Section 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (B) the
severance benefits for which such Continuing Employee would be eligible under
the severance plans or policies of Purchaser or its Affiliates, in each case,
determined (1) without taking into account any reduction after the Closing in
compensation paid to such Continuing Employee and (2) taking into account each
Continuing Employees service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any
predecessor entities) and, after the Closing, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries
in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or after
the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all
pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their
eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-
existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the
analogous the Company Benefit Plan, (ii) provide each such employee and their
eligible dependents with credit for any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee or dependent prior to the Effective Time under a Company Benefit
Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous
Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable
deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans,
and (iii) recognize all service of such employees with the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan to the same extent that such
service was taken into account under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the foregoing service recognition
shall not apply (x) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits
for the same period of services, (y) for purposes of benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension or the employer premium subsidy under any retiree
medical plan, or (z) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or that
provides benefits to a grandfathered employee population.

 

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume and
honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms. Parent hereby
acknowledges that a "change in control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning
of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at the Effective Time.

 

(d) If requested by Parent in writing at least twenty (20) business days prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause any 401(k) plan sponsored or
maintained by

 



-48-  the Company (each, a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to be terminated effective
as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the
occurrence of the Closing. In the event that Parent requests that any Company
401(k) Plan be terminated, (i) the Company shall provide Parent with evidence
that such plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be
subject to reasonable review and comment by Parent) not later than two (2)
days immediately preceding the Effective Time and (ii) the Continuing
Employees of the Company shall be eligible to participate, effective as of the
Effective Time, in a 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or one of
its Subsidiaries (a " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "). Parent and the Company shall
take any and all actions as may be required, including amendments to any
Company 401(k) Plan and/or Parent 401(k) Plan, to permit the Continuing
Employees of the Company who are then actively employed to make rollover
contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover distributions"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the form of cash,
notes (in the case of loans), Parent Common Stock or a combination thereof in
an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such Continuing
Employee of the Company from a Company 401(k) Plan.

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving
Corporation, the Company, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation,
the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or
terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any
other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii)
alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular
Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting
the generality of the final sentence of Section 9.11, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person,
including, without limitation, any current or former employee,
officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, each present and former director, officer or
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in
such capacity) (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or
after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining
to, the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person
and pertaining to matters, acts

 



-49-  or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred
by such Company Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law; _provided_ , that the Company Indemnified Party to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably
cooperate with the Company Indemnified Party, and the Company Indemnified
Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company (
_provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies
with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the
insured) with respect to claims against the present and former officers and
directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts
or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in
excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by
the Company for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums
for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance
which, in the Surviving Corporations good faith determination, provide the
maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In
lieu of the foregoing, the Company, in consultation with Parent, may (and at
the request of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to)
obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under the
Companys existing directors and officers insurance policy providing
equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the
extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate,
does not exceed the Premium Cap. If the Company purchases such a "tail
policy," Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such "tail policy"
in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

 

(c) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Company under
this Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified after the Effective Time
in a manner so as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party or any
other person entitled to the benefit of this Section 6.7 without the prior
written consent of the affected Company Indemnified Party or affected person.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns will consolidate
with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of
its assets or deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar
transaction, then in each case to the extent the obligations set forth
in this Section 6.7 are not otherwise transferred and

 



-50-  assumed by such successors and assigns by operation of law or otherwise, the
Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one
hand, and a Subsidiary of the Company, on the other) or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals,
immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper
officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by Parent.

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Parent and the Company (in such capacity, the "
_Notifying Party_ ") shall each promptly advise the other party of any change
or event (i) that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Notifying Party or (ii) which the Notifying Party believes
would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach
of any of the Notifying Partys representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually
or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in set forth in, if Parent
is the Notifying Party, Sections 7.1 or 7.3, or if the Company is the
Notifying Party, Sections 7.1 or 7.2; _provided_ , that any failure to give
notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not
be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.9 or the failure of any
condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise
constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such
notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result
in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be
satisfied.

 

6.10 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and the
Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in
respect of Parent Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record dates
and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties
hereto that holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two dividends,
or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares

receives in exchange therefor in the Merger. In furtherance of the foregoing,
(i) starting with the second quarter of 2016, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall cause its regular quarterly dividend record dates and payments
dates for Company Common Stock to be similar to the regular quarterly dividend
record dates and payments dates for Parent Common Stock and (ii) the Board of
Directors of Parent shall continue to pay dividends on the Parent Common Stock
on substantially the same record and payment date schedules as have been
utilized in the past.

 

6.11 _Corporate Governance_.

 

(a) On or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent shall
cause the number of directors that will comprise the full board of directors
of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time to be increased by two (2)
and to appoint two (2) then current directors of the Company designated by the
Company that are reasonably acceptable to the Board of the Directors of
Parent and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of
Directors of Parent to fill the vacancies resulting from such increases.

 



-51- (b) On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent (as the sole stockholder of
Parent Bank) shall cause the number of directors that will comprise the full
Board of Directors of Parent Bank at the Effective Time to be increased by two
(2), constituted in the same manner and with the same individuals as the Board
of Directors of the Surviving Corporation.

(c) At or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall invite each
member of the Board of Directors of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than those individuals who have joined or will join the
Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section
6.11(a)) to serve as a member of a board of the Company Bank Division of
Parent Bank in accordance with the terms set forth in Section 6.11 of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule.

 

(d) The Company and Parent agree to the additional actions set forth in
Section 6.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

6.12 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) The Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their officers, directors,
agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person
concerning any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) provide any confidential or
nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions
with, any person relating to any Acquisition Proposal, except to notify a
person that has made or, to the knowledge of the Company, is making any
inquiries with respect to, or is considering making, an Acquisition Proposal,
of the existence of the provisions of this Section 6.12(a); _provided_ ,
that, prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company by the Requisite Company Vote, in the event the Company receives an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit
its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or
cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in such
negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors
concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel,
and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that failure to
take such actions would be more likely than not to result in a violation of
its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ , _further_ , that,
prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant
to the foregoing proviso, the Company shall have entered into
a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable
to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement
shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with the
Company. The Company will, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any person other than Parent with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company will promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours) advise
Parent following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the
substance thereof

 



-52-  (including the material terms and conditions of and the identity of the
person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent
reasonably apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations
on a current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the material
terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill
agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance
with the terms thereof. As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ "
shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any
offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of
interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 25% or
more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or 25% or
more of any class of equity or voting securities of the Company or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than 25% of the consolidated assets of the Company, (ii) any tender offer
(including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would
result in such third party beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of
equity or voting securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the
consolidated assets of the Company, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company or
its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
more than 25% of the consolidated assets of the Company.

 

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board
of Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
from making any legally required disclosure to the Companys stockholders;
_provided_ , that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect
that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this
Agreement.

6.13 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall each use their
reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan to ensure that
all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and except in respect of any announcement required by
applicable law, or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing
any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

6.14 _Change of Method_. The Parent shall be empowered, at any time prior to
the Effective Time, to change the method or structure of effecting the
combination of the Company and Parent (including the provisions of Article I),
if and to the extent they both deem such change to be necessary, appropriate
or desirable; _provided_ , that no such change shall (i) alter or change the
Exchange Ratio or the number of shares of Parent Common Stock received by the
Companys stockholders in exchange for each share of Company Common Stock or
the Cash Consideration, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of
the Companys stockholders or Parents stockholders pursuant to this
Agreement, (iii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Company or Parent
pursuant to this Agreement or (iv) materially impede or delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner. The
parties agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate amendment to this
Agreement executed by both parties in accordance with Section 9.2.

 



-53- 6.15 _Restructuring Efforts_. If either the Company or Parent shall have
failed to obtain the Requisite Company Vote or the Requisite Parent Vote at
the duly convened Company Meeting or Parent Meeting, as applicable, or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith
use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood that neither
party shall have any obligation to alter or change any material terms,
including the Exchange Ratio or the Cash Consideration, the amount or kind of
the consideration to be issued to holders of the capital stock of the Company
as provided for in this Agreement, in a manner adverse to such party or its
stockholders) and/or resubmit this Agreement and/or the transactions
contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section 6.15) to its
respective stockholders for adoption or approval, as applicable.

 

6.16 _Takeover Statutes_. None of the Company, Parent or their respective
Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover
Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary
steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute
now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport
to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or
applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

 

6.17 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. The Company and Parent
agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers
and directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Company Insiders_ "), both prior to and
after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Company Insiders not be
subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion
of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards in the Merger,
and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of
this Section 6.17. The Board of Directors of Parent and of the Company, or a
committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly,
and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be
required to cause (in the case of the Company) any dispositions of Company
Common Stock or Company Equity Awards by the Company Insiders, and (in the
case of Parent) any acquisitions of Parent Common Stock by any Company
Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors
of the Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law.

6.18 _Assumption of Company Debt_. Parent agrees to execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving
Corporation, at or prior to the Effective Time, one or more supplemental
indentures, guarantees, and other instruments required for the due assumption
of the Companys obligations in respect of its outstanding debt,
guarantees, securities, and other agreements to the extent required by the
terms of such debt, guarantees, securities, and other agreements.

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of Parent or the Company:

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument, if
the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board;

 



-57- (b) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity that must grant
a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the Bank
Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order
permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the
consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger, unless the failure to obtain a
Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements of such party set forth herein;

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before December 31, 2016 (the " _Termination Date_ "),
unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or
observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

(d) by either Parent or the Company ( _provided_ , that the terminating party
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of
the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or
any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent,
or Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, which breach or
failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other
breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to
be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date,
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a
termination by Parent, or 7.3, in the case of a termination by the Company,
and which is not cured within forty-five (45) days following written notice to
the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case
of a termination by the Company, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured
during such period (or such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination
Date);

 

(e) by the Company prior to such time as the Requisite Parent Vote is
obtained, if (i) the Board of Directors of Parent shall have failed to
recommend in the Joint Proxy Statement that the stockholders of Parent adopt
this Agreement and approve the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in
connection with the Merger as contemplated by this Agreement, or
withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation in a manner adverse to
the Company, or publicly disclosed that it has resolved to do so, or (ii) the
Parent or its Board of Directors has breached its obligations under Section
6.3 in any material respect; or

(f) by Parent prior to such time as the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, if
(i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have (A) failed to recommend
in the Joint Proxy Statement that the stockholders of the Company adopt this
Agreement, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation in a manner
adverse to Parent, or publicly disclosed that it has resolved to do so, or
failed to recommend against acceptance of a tender offer or exchange offer
constituting an Acquisition Proposal that has been publicly disclosed within
ten (10) business days after the commencement of such tender or exchange
offer, in any such case whether or not permitted by the terms hereof or (B)
recommended or

 



-58-  endorsed an Acquisition Proposal or failed to issue a press release

business days after an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced, or (ii)
the Company or its Board of Directors has breached its obligations under

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, and none of Parent, the Company, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Sections 6.2(b) and
this Section 8.2 and Article IX shall survive any termination of this
Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful and
material breach of any provision of this Agreement occurring prior to
termination (which, in the case of the Company, shall include the loss to the
holders of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards of the economic
benefits of the Merger, including the loss of the premium offered to the
holders of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards, it being
understood that the Company shall be entitled to pursue damages for such
losses and to enforce the right to recover such losses on behalf of its
shareholders and the holders of Company Equity Awards in its sole and absolute
discretion, and any amounts received by the Company in connection therewith
may be retained by the Company).

(b)

 

(i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made known to senior management of the Company or has been made directly
to its stockholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced (and
not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company and (A)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without the Requisite Company Vote having been
obtained (and all other conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.3 had been
satisfied or were capable of being satisfied prior to such termination) or
(B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(d) as a result of a willful breach, and (C) prior to the date that is
twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the Company enters
into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that
referred to above), then the Company shall, on the earlier of the date it
enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such
transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to
$69,500,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ , that for purposes of
this Section 8.2(b), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
to "25%" shall instead refer to "50%".

 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(f), then the Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same
day funds, the Termination Fee on the date of termination.

 



-59- (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to Section 8.1(e), then Parent shall pay the Company, by wire transfer of
same day funds, the Termination Fee on the date of termination.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages arising out of the other
partys fraud or willful and material breach of any provision of this
Agreement, in the event that this Agreement is terminated as provided in
Section 8.1, the maximum aggregate amount of monetary fees, liabilities or
damages payable by a single party under this Agreement shall be equal to the
Termination Fee, and neither the Company nor Parent shall be required to pay
the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(e) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent or the Company fails
promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to
obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a
judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination Fee, such non-paying
party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In
addition, if Parent or the Company, as the case may be, fails to pay the
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then such party shall pay
interest on such overdue amounts (for the period commencing as of the date
that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the
date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum
equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any
successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was required to
be made for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was
originally required to be paid. The amounts payable by Parent and the
Company, as applicable, pursuant to Section 8.2(b) constitute liquidated
damages and not a penalty, and, except in the case of fraud or willful and
material breach of this Agreement, shall be the sole monetary remedy of the
Company and Parent, as applicable, in the event of a termination of this
Agreement specified in such section.

shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
