Preferred Shares_ "), with the terms of the Parent Series A Preferred Shares
set forth in articles supplementary substantially in the form set forth in

securities convertible into Company Common Shares), reorganization,

like change with respect to the Company Common Shares effectuated after the

Section 3.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Not less than five (5) business days prior to the
Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the exchange agent in
connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). As of the Effective
Time, Parent shall, for the sole benefit of the holders of the Company Common
Shares, deposit with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Common Shares
in book-entry form issuable pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ equal to the
aggregate Merger Consideration (excluding any Fractional Share
Consideration) and (ii) cash in immediately

 



17  available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Fractional
Share Consideration (such evidence of book-entry Parent Common Shares and cash
amounts, together with any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
_Section 3.2(f)_, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole
benefit of the Companys stockholders. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to make the payments to the Companys stockholder as
contemplated by _Section 3.1_, Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to,
promptly deposit additional Parent Common Shares or funds, as applicable, with
the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the
amount required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration
out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this
Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however,_
 that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct
short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated P-1
or A-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
Ten Billion U.S. Dollars ($10,000,000,000) (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that
no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares pursuant to this _Article III_.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
the Surviving Entity on the earlier of (i) one (1) year after the Effective
Time or (ii) the full payment of the Exchange Fund.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Entity to, cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and make available for
collection by hand) to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company
Common Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Company Common
Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Company Shares_ ") and whose
Company Common Shares were converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_ into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal in customary
form, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent
or, in the case of Book-Entry Company Shares, upon adherence to the
procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal and (B) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Company Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration, including any amount payable in respect of the Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.6,_ and any dividends or other
distributions on Parent Common Shares in accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_.
Such instructions shall provide that (1) at the election of the surrendering
holder, Certificates may be surrendered by hand delivery or otherwise, (2) the
Merger Consideration in exchange for Certificates and Book-Entry Company
Shares shall be delivered in uncertificated book-entry form to the
surrendering holder and (3) the Fractional Share Consideration, if any,
payable in exchange for Certificates and Book-Entry Company Shares will be
payable by wire transfer to the surrendering holder.

 



18 (ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Company Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Company Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Company Common Share formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Company Share pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article III_ and, if applicable, the Fractional Share Consideration that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.6_, and any amounts
that such holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends or other
distributions on Parent Common Shares in accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_
less any required withholding of Taxes, plus any dividends or other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may
have been authorized by the Company and which remain unpaid at the Effective
Time. Any Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Company Shares so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled.

 

(iii) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition precedent of payment that (A) the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid
any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Entity that such Tax either has been paid or is
not required to be paid. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to Book-Entry Company Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Book-Entry Company Shares are registered.

(iv) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each
Certificate and Book-Entry Company Share shall be deemed at any time from and
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article III_ , including any
amount payable in respect of the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance
with _Section 3.6_, and any dividends or other distributions on Parent Common
Shares in accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_ and any dividends or other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been authorized by the Company and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

(v) The delivery of the Parent Series A Preferred Shares in exchange for
shares of Company Series B Preferred Stock shall be subject to the delivery to
the Surviving Entity of certificates (if any) representing such shares of
Company Series B Preferred Stock (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof).

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares_. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company
Common Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Company Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company
Common Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares are
presented to the Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 



19 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall be
entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund
that have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject
only to the Exchange Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares, and thereafter such holders shall
be entitled to look only to the Surviving Entity and Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration, including any
amount payable in respect of the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance
with _Section 3.6_, and any dividends or other distributions on Parent Common
Shares in accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_ and any dividends or other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been authorized by the Company and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time,
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares
and compliance with the procedures in  _Section 3.2(b)_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Entity, Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Company Share for any
Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if
reasonably required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such holder of a
bond in such reasonable and customary amount as the Surviving Entity may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to _Section 3.1_ hereof, including any amount
payable in respect of the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with
_Section 3.6_, and any dividends or other distributions on Parent Common
Shares in accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_ and any dividends or other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been authorized by the Company and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

(f) _Dividends with Respect to Parent Common Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Company Share with respect to the Parent Common
Shares issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions
paid with respect to such Parent Common Shares to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange
Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Company Share (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable
Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Company
Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and if required by Section
3.2(e), posting of a bond) there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without
interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with

 



20  respect to such Parent Common Shares to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such Parent Common Shares.

(a) __Restricted Company Share Awards__. As of the Effective Time, each
Restricted Company Share Award granted under a Company Equity Plan
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without action by the holder of any Restricted Company Share Award, shall
be converted into an award of Restricted Parent Shares with respect to a
number of Parent Common Shares, rounded to the nearest whole share,
determined by multiplying the number of Company Common Shares subject to such
Restricted Company Share Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Company Equity Plan and Restricted Company Share Award agreement in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (with continuation of the applicable
vesting terms, and giving effect to  _Section 6.6(d)_).

(b) __Company Restricted Share Unit Awards__. As of the Effective Time, each
Company RSU Award granted under a Company Equity Plan outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without action by the
holder of the Company RSU Award, shall be converted into an award of Parent
RSUs with respect to a number of Parent Common Shares, rounded to the nearest
whole share, determined by multiplying the number of Company Common Shares
subject to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by
the Exchange Ratio, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company Equity Plan and Company RSU Award agreement in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (with continuation of the applicable
vesting terms, and giving effect to _Section 6.6(d)_).

 

(c) __Company Options__. As of the Effective Time, each Company Option granted
under a Company Equity Plan outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, by virtue of the Merger and without action
by the holder of the Company Option, shall be converted into an award of
options to purchase (i) a number of Parent Common Shares, rounded down to the
nearest whole share, equal to the product determined by multiplying the total
number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, (ii) at a per-share
exercise price, rounded up to the nearest whole cent, equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per Company Common Share at which
such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by
the Exchange Ratio, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company Equity Plan and Company Option agreement in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (with continuation of the applicable
vesting terms, and giving effect to  _Section 6.6(d)_).

 



21 (d) __Phantom Share Awards__. As of the Effective Time, each Phantom Share
Award granted under a Company Equity Plan or the Company Directors Plan
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, by virtue of the Merger and without action by the holder of any
Phantom Share Award, shall vest and be converted into the right to receive a
number of Parent Common Shares, rounded to the nearest whole share, determined
by multiplying the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Phantom
Share Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio,
subject to and in accordance with, the terms of the applicable Company Equity
Plan, the Company Directors Plan, and the applicable award agreement in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time,

sufficient number of Parent Common Shares for delivery upon the conversion of
Restricted Company Share Awards and the settlement of the Company RSU Awards,
Company Options, and Phantom Share Awards, as applicable and as contemplated
by this _Section 3.4_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other
appropriate form) registering such number of Parent Common Shares necessary to

Law; _provided_ that Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, shall provide the Company with notice at least ten
(10) business days prior to Closing of any proposed withholding and the
Parties shall, to the extent reasonably possible, work together to avoid or
reduce any such withholding obligation. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted and withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 3.6 _Fractional Shares_.

 

(a) No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
Book-Entry Company Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of
Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder
of shares of Company Common Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Common Share
(after aggregating all Certificates and Book-Entry Company Shares delivered by
such holder) 

 



22  shall receive, in lieu thereof and only on surrender thereof, cash (without
interest), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in an amount
representing such holders proportionate interest in the net proceeds from
the sale by the Exchange Agent of all such Parent Common Shares that would
otherwise be issued to such holders.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to aggregate all fractional shares of Parent Common
Shares that would otherwise have been distributed pursuant to the Merger,
rounded to the nearest whole share (the " _Fractional Shares_ "), and deliver

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

The following representations and warranties by Parent and Merger Sub are
qualified in their entirety by reference to the disclosures (a) in the Parent
SEC Documents filed or furnished prior to the date hereof but excluding
statements in any "Risk Factors" section to the extent that such statements
are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature and (b) set forth or
referenced in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the Company
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure
Letter_ "). The Parties agree that each disclosure set forth in the Parent
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed (whether or not an explicit cross reference
appears) to qualify or modify the Section to which it corresponds and any
other Section to the extent the applicability of the disclosure to each other
Section is reasonably apparent. Subject to the foregoing, Parent and Merger
Sub, on a joint and several basis, represent and warrant to the Company that:

 

Section 5.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) Parent is a real estate investment trust duly formed, validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of the State of Maryland and has the
requisite power and authority to own and conduct its business as now being
conducted. Merger Sub is a limited liability company duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the 

 



43  State of Maryland and has the requisite power and authority to conduct its

its business as now being conducted. Parent and each Parent Subsidiary is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of
its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for
those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be
in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has delivered to or
made available to the Company, prior to the execution of this Agreement, true
and complete copies of any amendments to the Parent Governing Documents not
filed prior to the date of this Agreement with the SEC. Parent is in
compliance with the terms of the Parent Governing Documents, except as has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) _Section 5.1(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of the Subsidiaries of Parent (each a " _Parent Subsidiary_ "),
together with the jurisdiction of organization or incorporation, as the case
may be, of each Parent Subsidiary. Each Parent Subsidiary and, to Parents
knowledge, each Parent Joint Venture, is in compliance in all material
respects with the terms of its constituent organizational or governing
documents, except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,

complete list of each Parent Subsidiary that is a REIT, a Qualified REIT
Subsidiary or a Taxable REIT Subsidiary.

par value $0.01 per share (the " _Parent Preferred Shares_ "). At the close of
business on June 29, 2015, (A) 236,860,294 Parent Common Shares were issued
and outstanding (which includes 270,539 Restricted Parent Shares), (B) no
shares of Preferred Shares were issued or outstanding, and (C) no Parent
Common Shares were held by any of Parents Subsidiaries. All of the

Parent RSUs, Trustee RSUs and Parent PSUs, there are no (x) options, warrants,
calls, pre-emptive rights, subscriptions or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any kind, including any
shareholder rights plan, relating to the issued or unissued capital shares of
Parent, obligating Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or
sell or cause to be issued, transferred or sold any shares of, or other
equity interest in, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity interests, or
obligating Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to grant, extend or enter
into any such option, warrant, call, subscription or other similar right,
agreement, arrangement or commitment (collectively, " _Parent Equity

Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise

 



44  acquire any Parent Common Shares or any shares of, or other Parent Equity
Interests in, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or to provide funds to make

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. The Parent Common Shares to be issued to
the Company Shareholders in connection with the Merger and the Parent Series A

and nonassessable and free and clear of any Liens (other than limitations
on transfer and other restrictions imposed by federal or state securities
Laws).

(b) There are no voting trusts, proxies or other similar agreements to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of
Parent Common Shares or any shares of, or other Equity Interest, of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has granted any preemptive rights, anti-dilutive rights or rights of first
refusal or similar rights with respect to any of its shares or other Parent
Equity Interests. There are no bonds, debentures or notes issued by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries that entitle the holder thereof to vote together with
shareholders of Parent on any matters related to Parent. No Parent Common
Shares are owned by any Parent Subsidiary.

 

(c) Parent or another Parent Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly, all of
the issued and outstanding shares or other Parent Equity Interests of each of
the Parent Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens (other than limitations

no other business activities and has conducted its operations only as
contemplated hereby.

(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its

following the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall have
considered in good faith any proposed revisions to this Agreement proposed in
writing by Parent, and shall have determined in good faith, following
consultation with independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel,

change to the material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in

it intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the
reasons therefor, (iv) during such five (5) business day period, the Company

account any adjustment or modification to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its duties under
applicable Law.

taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, if failure to do so would violate
applicable Law or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to
the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the

Competing Proposal from any Person or group of Persons, which Competing
Proposal was made or renewed on or after the date hereof and did not result
from a breach of this _Section 6.4_, (i) Parent and its Representatives may
contact such Person or group of Persons solely to request clarification of
the terms and conditions thereof and (ii) if the Parent Board, or any

non-public information) with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries to the
Person or group of Persons who has made such Competing Proposal; provided that

(B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to
change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in each case, in a manner
adverse to the Company, the Parent Board Recommendation, (C) take any formal
action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a
tender offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer
or a temporary "stop, look and listen" communication by the Parent Board
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, (D) fail to publicly recommend
against any Competing Proposal, or fail to publicly reaffirm the Parent Board
Recommendation, in each case within ten (10) days after the written request

Meeting, as it may be adjourned or postponed) or (E) adopt, approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to the shareholders of

obtained, but not after, the Parent Board may make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to a Competing Proposal that was not
solicited in breach of this _Section 6.4_, if and only if, prior to taking
such action, the Parent Board has determined in good faith, after consultation
with independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (x) that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the trustees duties
under applicable Law and (y) that such Competing Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may
be offered by the Company pursuant to the following proviso; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in connection with the Competing Proposal of any Person (1)
Parent has given the Company at least five (5) business days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
specify in reasonable detail the reasons therefor and describe the material
terms and conditions of, and attach a complete copy of, the Superior Proposal
that is the basis for such action (it being understood that such material
terms shall include the identity of the third party making the Superior
Proposal), (2) Parent has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with the Company during such notice period, to the
extent the Company wishes to negotiate, to enable the Company to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (3) following
the end of such notice period, the Parent Board shall have considered in good
faith any proposed revisions to this Agreement proposed in writing by the
Company, and shall have determined in good faith, following consultation
with independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the
Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such
revisions were to be given effect and (4) in the event of any material change
to the material terms of such Superior Proposal, Parent shall, in each case,
have delivered to the Company an additional notice consistent with that
described in subclause (1) above and the notice period shall have recommenced,
except that the notice period shall be at least forty-eight (48) hours.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time the
Parent Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Parent Board may make a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change (other than in response to a Superior Proposal,
which shall be covered by the other provisions hereof) if and only if (i) a
material development or change in circumstances has occurred or arisen or
first become known to the Parent Board after the date of this Agreement that
was neither known to such party nor reasonably foreseeable as of the date of
this Agreement (and which change or development does not relate to a
Competing Proposal), (ii) the Parent Board has first reasonably determined in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to do
so would be inconsistent with the trustees duties under applicable Law,
(iii) five (5) business days shall have elapsed since Parent has given notice
of such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change to the Company advising that it
intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the
reasons therefor, (iv) during such five (5) business day period, Parent has
considered and, at the reasonable request of the Company, engaged in good
faith discussions with the Company regarding, any adjustment or modification
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the Company, and (v) Parent Board,
following such five (5) business day period, again reasonably determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and taking into
account any adjustment or modification to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by the Company, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
duties under applicable Law.

 



75 (i) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Parent Board from: (i) taking
and disclosing to the shareholders of Parent a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act, if failure to do so would violate applicable Law or (ii) making
any "stop, look and listen" communication to Parents shareholders pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not permit the Parent Board to make any Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change except as permitted by _Section 6.4(g)_ and
_Section 6.4(h)_.

(j) Each Party shall notify the other Party promptly (but in no event later
than twenty-four (24) hours) after its receipt of any Competing Proposal, or
any request for nonpublic information relating to such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries by any person that informs such Party or any of its Subsidiaries
that it is considering making, or has made, a Competing Proposal, or any
inquiry from any person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with such
Party relating to a possible Competing Proposal. Such notice shall be made
orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person
making the Competing Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms and
conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy thereof
if in writing and any related documentation or correspondence). Each Party
shall also promptly, and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours, notify
the other party, orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or
negotiations concerning any Competing Proposal or provides nonpublic
information to any person in accordance with this _Section 6.4_. In addition,
following the date hereof, each of (i) the Company, on the one hand, and (ii)
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall keep the other Party
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of any material
developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal and
upon the request of such Party shall apprise such Party of the status of such
Competing Proposal (including by providing a copy of all material
documentation or correspondence relating thereto, including all drafts and
final versions of agreements relating thereto). Each of (i) the Company, on
the one hand, and (ii) Parent, on the other hand, agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits it from providing any
information to the other Party in accordance with this _Section 6.4_.

(k) As used in this Agreement, " _Competing Proposal_ " shall mean any
proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries or
the Company and its Subsidiaries) or "group", within the meaning of Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act, relating to, in a single transaction or series of
related transactions, any (i) in the case of the Company, (A) acquisition of

Companys revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (B)
acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Shares, (C)
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Shares, (D)
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or (E)
any combination of the foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the
percentage of consolidated assets, consolidated revenues or earnings and
Company Common Shares involved is 20% or more; in each case, other than the
Transactions or (ii) in the case of Parent, (A) acquisition of assets of
Parent and its Subsidiaries equal to 20% or more of Parents consolidated
assets or to which 20% or more of Parents revenues or earnings on a
consolidated basis are attributable, (B) acquisition of 20% or

 



76  more of the outstanding Parent Common Shares, (C) tender offer or exchange
offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 20%
or more of the outstanding Parent Common Shares, (D) merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving Parent or (E) any combination of
the foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of
consolidated assets, consolidated revenues or earnings and Parent Common
Shares involved is 20% or more; in each case, other than the Transactions.

 

(l) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any _bona
fide_ written Competing Proposal that (i) in the case of the Company, the
Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and taking into account all
legal, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the
proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and
conditions to consummation), is more favorable to the Company and its
stockholders than the Transactions (including, as the case may be, any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to
such proposal or otherwise) and is reasonably likely to receive all required
governmental approvals and financing on a timely basis and is otherwise
reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed, or (ii) in the
case of Parent, the Parent Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and taking
into account all legal, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the
person making the proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions and conditions to consummation), is more favorable to Parent and
its shareholders than the Transactions (including, the case may be,
any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the Company in
response to such proposal or otherwise) and is reasonably likely to receive
all required governmental approvals and financing on a timely basis and is
otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed;
_provided_ , in each case, that for purposes of the definition of "Superior
Proposal", the references to "20%" in the definition of Competing Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

(m) Nothing in this _Section 6.4_ shall permit either party to terminate this
Agreement or affect any other obligation of the Parties under this Agreement.
Neither Party shall submit to the vote of its stockholders or shareholders any
Competing Proposal other than the Merger prior to the termination of this
Agreement.

 

Section 6.5 _Joint Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, (i) the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and cause to be
filed with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement in preliminary form, and (ii)
Parent shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, the Form S-4 with
respect to the Parent Common Shares issuable in the Merger, which will include
the Joint Proxy Statement with respect to the Company Shareholder Meeting and
Parent Shareholder Meeting. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (x) have the Form S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, (y) ensure that
the Form S-4 complies in all material respects with the applicable provisions
of the Exchange Act or Securities Act, and (z) keep the Form S-4 effective for
so long as necessary to complete the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent
shall furnish all information concerning itself, its affiliates and the
holders of its capital stock to the

 



77  other and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and
Joint Proxy Statement. The Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement shall include
all information reasonably requested by such other Party to be included
therein. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement, and shall,
as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other with
copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on one hand,
and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to the
Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 received from the SEC and advise the
other party of any oral comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement or
the Form S-4 received from the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments from the SEC with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement, and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable
to any comment from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each
of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and provide the other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including
the proposed final version of such document or response). Parent shall advise
the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time of
effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto
or the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Shares issuable
in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or
suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Parent shall also take
any other action required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the
rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of the
Parent Common Shares in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning the Company and the holders of the Shares as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such actions.

 

(b) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
the Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company or Parent, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to,
any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the
Form S-4 and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the information
contained in such amendment or supplement to shareholders of the Company and
Parent. Nothing in this _Section 6.5(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any
Party under _Section 6.5(a)_. For purposes of this _Section 6.5_, any
information concerning or related to the Company, its affiliates or the
Company Shareholder Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the
Company, and any information concerning or related to Parent, its affiliates
or the Parent Shareholder Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by
Parent.

 



78 (c) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Governing
Documents, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Company Shareholder Meeting. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
stockholders of the Company entitled to vote at the Company Shareholder
Meeting and to hold the Company Shareholder Meeting as soon as practicable
after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act and in any
case within forty-five (45) days of the Form S-4 being declared effective. The
Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its shareholders that
they give the Company Shareholder Approval, include such recommendation in the
Joint Proxy Statement and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, in each case except to the extent
that the Company Board shall have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
as permitted by  _Section 6.4_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 6.5(c)_, if, on a date for which the Company Shareholder
Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of Company Common Shares to obtain the Company Shareholder
Approval, or if necessary to comply with applicable Law, whether or not a
quorum is present, the Company shall have the right to make one or more
successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Shareholder Meeting;
_provided_ that the Company Shareholder Meeting is not postponed or adjourned
to a date that is more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the
Company Shareholder Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any
adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law). Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve the Company of its obligation to
submit the Merger to its stockholders for a vote on the approval thereof.
The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with _Section 9.1_, its obligations to hold the Company
Shareholder Meeting pursuant to this _Section 6.5(c)_ shall not be affected
by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to
the Company of any Competing Proposal or by any Company Adverse Recommendation
Change.

 

(d) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent
shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Parent Governing Documents,
establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Parent Shareholder Meeting. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of Parent
entitled to vote at the Parent Shareholder Meeting and to hold the Parent
Shareholder Meeting as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act and in any case within forty-five (45) days
of the Form S-4 being declared effective. Parent shall, through the Parent
Board, recommend to its shareholders that they give the Parent Shareholder
Approval, include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, and
solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Parent Shareholder
Approval, in each case except to the extent that the Parent Board shall have
made a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by _Section 6.4_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this  _Section 6.5(d)_, if, on a
date for which the Parent Shareholder Meeting is scheduled, Parent has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of Parent Common Shares to
obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval, or if necessary to comply with
applicable Law, whether or not a quorum is present, Parent shall have the
right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the
Parent Shareholder Meeting; _provided_ that the Parent Shareholder Meeting is
not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than thirty (30) days after
the date for which the Parent Shareholder Meeting was originally scheduled
(excluding any adjournments or

 



79  postponements required by applicable Law). Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to relieve Parent of its obligation to submit the
Merger to its shareholders for a vote on the approval thereof. Parent agrees
that, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
_Section 9.1_, its obligations to hold the Parent Shareholder Meeting
pursuant to this _Section 6.5(d)_ shall not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Parent of any Competing
Proposal or by any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(e) The Company and Parent will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to hold the Company Shareholder Meeting and the Parent Shareholder Meeting on
the same date and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement.

Section 6.6 _Employee Matters_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity
and its Subsidiaries to honor all Parent Benefit Plans and Company Benefit
Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, it being
understood that the foregoing shall not be construed as a limitation on the
right of Parent and its Subsidiaries to amend or terminate any such Company
Benefit Plan to the extent permitted by its terms. From the Effective Time
until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause to be provided, to each current (as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time) employee of Parent or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Parent Employees_ "), for so long as such Parent Employee remains employed by
Parent and its Subsidiaries, (i) base compensation at least equal to that
provided to the Parent Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii)
annual incentive compensation opportunities (excluding equity-based
compensation opportunities) that are no less favorable than those provided to
similarly situated employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, it being
understood that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall make no modifications
to bonus opportunities with respect to the Companys fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015; and (iii) employee benefits that are no less favorable than
those provided to similarly situated employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

 

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate, severance, paid time off and level of benefits) under
the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Affiliates providing any
benefits to any current (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time)
employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company
Employees_ ") after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors as if such service were
with Parent or an applicable subsidiary, to the extent such credit was given
under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time, provided
that the foregoing shall not apply for purposes of benefit accrual under
defined benefit plans or to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a similar Company Benefit
Plan in which such Company Employee participated (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability,

 



80  life, vacation or other welfare benefits to any Company Employee (or his or
her covered dependents) (collectively, the " _Parent Welfare Plans_ "), Parent
shall take commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and limitations and actively-at-work requirements of such
Parent Welfare Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents under the
corresponding Old Plan during the portion of the plan year of such Old Plans
ending on the date such Company Employees participation in the corresponding
Parent Welfare Plan begins (such initial plan year of participation, the "
_Initial Year of Participation_ ") to be taken into account under such Parent
Welfare Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents for the Initial Year of Participation as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such Parent Welfare Plan.

 

(c) It is expressly acknowledged, understood and agreed that nothing in this
_Section 6.6_ or otherwise contained in this Agreement is intended to or
does or shall constitute an amendment to or establishment of any employee
benefit or other plan or, subject to the express provisions of _Section
6.6(a)_ and _Section 6.6(b)_, shall prevent the amendment or termination of
any such plan. Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee to any Company
Employee of (i) employment or (ii) any specific term or condition of
employment.

 

(d) The consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions shall be deemed
to be a "change of control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of each
applicable Parent Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Plan (it being understood,
that as of the Effective Time, all holders of LTIP Units have waived their
rights to have the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be treated as
a "change of control" for purposes of the applicable LTIP Unit award
agreement).

(e) Notwithstanding  _Section 6.2(l)_ of this Agreement, Parent may, and may
cause any Subsidiary of Parent to, amend any Parent Benefit Plan that includes
a definition of "change of control" or term of similar import to provide that
the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions shall be deemed to
constitute a "change of control" or term of similar import within the meaning
of such Parent Benefit Plan.

 

Section 6.7 _REIT Dividend_. If either party determines that it is necessary
to declare a Special Distribution in accordance with  _Section 6.1(c)_ or
_Section 6.2(c)_, it shall if reasonably practicable notify the other party
at least twenty (20) days (and in any event within five (5) calendar days)
prior to the date for the Parent Shareholder Meeting, in the case of a
declaration by the Company, or the Company Shareholder Meeting, in the case of
a declaration by Parent, and such other party shall be entitled to declare a
dividend per share payable (i) in the case of the Company, to holders of
Company Common Shares, in an amount per share of Company Common Shares equal
to the product of (A) the Special Distribution declared by Parent with respect
to each Parent Common Share and (B) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) in the case
of Parent, to holders of Parent Common Shares, in an amount per Parent Common
Share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Special Distribution
declared by the Company with respect to each Company Common Share by (y) the
Exchange Ratio. The record date and payment date for any dividend payable
pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ shall be the close of business on the last
business day prior to the Closing Date. __

 



81 Section 6.8 _Specified Property_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, except, in the case of clauses (b)(iii) or (e)
below, to the extent attributable to or arising out of the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, Parent agrees that
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time or the date, if
any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, except
as consented to in writing by the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned and shall be deemed given if
the Company fails to respond to a written request from Parent within five (5)
days of its receipt of such request) Parent shall not and shall not permit any
of its Subsidiaries to:

 

(a) enter into any lease agreement or amend or modify any lease agreement, in
each case affecting the Specified Property;

 

(b) (i) incur, create, assume, refinance, replace, guarantee, endorse or amend
or modify the terms of any Indebtedness for borrowed money or issue, or amend
or modify the terms of, any debt securities, in each case with an aggregate
principal amount of more than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), (ii) assume,
guarantee, endorse, or otherwise become responsible (whether
directly, contingently or otherwise) for any Indebtedness with an aggregate
principal amount of more than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or (iii) incur,
create, assume or guarantee any recourse obligations, in each case of clauses
(i) through (iii) relating principally to the Specified Property;

(c) pay, incur or agree to pay any brokers commission with respect to any
transaction involving the Specified Property other than commissions payable
pursuant to Contracts existing on the date hereof, copies of which have been
disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof;

 

(d) pay, incur or agree to pay any capital expenditures or other investments
with respect to the Specified Property in excess of One Million U.S. Dollars
($1,000,000) in the aggregate; or

(e) take any action that, under the terms of any Indebtedness of the Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries relating principally to the Specified Property having
a principal amount in excess of One Million U.S. Dollars ($1,000,000),
recourse for which is limited (subject to customary exceptions) to certain
assets encumbered by a Lien securing such Indebtedness, would reasonably be
expected to cause any portion of such Indebtedness to no longer be subject to
such limitations on recourse.

 

Section 6.9 _Parent OpCo Tax Status_. Effective at least one (1) business day
prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall take all necessary actions to cause
Parent OpCo to satisfy the requirements to qualify as an entity disregarded as
separate from Parent for federal income tax purposes.

 

Section 6.10 _Opco Merger_. Prior to the Effective Time, if (x) reasonably
required in order to procure that Indebtedness relating principally to the
Specified Property and having a principal amount in excess of One Million U.S.
Dollars ($1,000,000) shall continue to be subject to limitations on recourse
as set forth in Section 6.8(e) or (y) otherwise with Parents prior

 



82  consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), the Company may (i) form a wholly owned subsidiary and cause such
wholly owned subsidiary to merge with and into the Company OpCo (the " _OpCo
Merger_ "), with Company Opco surviving the Opco Merger as the surviving
entity and each limited partnership interest of Company Opco (other than
general partnership interests, or limited partnership interests held by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and/or LTIP Units) being converted into
the right to receive a number of Company Common Shares equal to the product of
one multiplied by the Conversion Factor (as such term is defined in the
Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Company
Opco); _provided_ , _however_ , that any such OpCo Merger shall be effected in
compliance with applicable Law and pursuant to a definitive agreement in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, and (ii) make any payments
required in connection with or as a result of the Opco Merger pursuant to the
terms of Company Tax Protection Agreements.

 

Section 6.11 _Stub Dividends_. Parent shall declare a dividend to the holders
of Parent Common Shares and the Company shall declare a dividend to the
holders of Company Common Shares, the record and payment date for each of
which shall be the close of business on the last business day prior to the
Closing Date, subject to funds being legally available therefor. The per
share dividend amount payable by the Company shall be an amount equal to the
Companys most recent quarterly dividend, multiplied by the number of days
elapsed from the beginning of the then-current quarter through and including
the day prior to the Closing Date occurs, and divided by the actual number of
days in the calendar quarter in which the Closing Date occurs. The per share
dividend amount payable by Parent shall be an amount equal to Parents most
recent monthly dividend, multiplied by the number of days elapsed from the
beginning of the then current month through and including the day prior to the
Closing Date occurs, and divided by the actual number of days in the calendar
month in which the Closing Date occurs. Holders of Company Common Shares
entitled to receive the dividend on Company Common Shares contemplated by this
_Section 6.11_ shall be entitled to receive such distribution from the
Surviving Entity at the time such shares are exchanged pursuant to _Article
III_.

efforts to allow such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in
loss or waiver of such privilege, including, but not limited to, entering into
appropriate common interest or similar agreements), or (ii) provide access to
the other Party or any of their respective officers, employees or
Representatives for the purpose of conducting any sampling of the environment

fulfill in all respects the obligations of such Person to the fullest
extent permissible under applicable Law, under the Company Governing
Documents, and corresponding organizational or governing documents of such
Company Subsidiary, in each case, as in effect on the date hereof and under
any indemnification or other similar agreements in effect on the date hereof
(the " _Indemnification Agreements_ ") to the individuals entitled to
indemnification, exculpation and/or advancement of expenses under such Company
Governing Documents, other organizational or governing documents or
Indemnification Agreements (the " _Covered Persons_ ") arising out of or
relating to actions or omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, including in connection with the consideration,
negotiation and approval of this Agreement and the Transactions.

(b) Without limiting the provisions of  _Section 7.4(a)_, for a period of

any matter covered hereby commenced during such six (6) year period shall have
been finally disposed of), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity
to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each Covered Person against and from any costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or

anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 7.4_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement, Parent and the Surviving Entity (x) shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), (y) shall not have any
obligation under this Agreement to any Covered Person to the extent that a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable
order that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case
the Covered Person shall promptly refund to Parent or the Surviving Entity
the amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant thereto (unless
such court orders otherwise) and (z) shall not settle or compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation of a Covered Person for

contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of Covered Persons for periods prior
to and including the Effective Time than are currently set forth in such

liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent may
substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound carriers of
at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from or related to
facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments
for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the annual
premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (such
300% amount, the " _Base Premium_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , if such
insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an
annual premium in excess of the Base Premium, Parent shall maintain the most
advantageous policies of directors and officers insurance obtainable for an
annual premium equal to the Base Premium; _provided_ , _further_ , if the
Company in its sole discretion elects, by giving written notice to Parent at
least five (5) business days prior to the Effective Time, then, in lieu of the
foregoing insurance, effective as of the Effective Time, the Company shall
purchase a trustees and officers liability insurance "tail" or "runoff"
insurance program for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time with
respect to wrongful acts and/or omissions committed or allegedly committed at
or prior to the Effective Time (such coverage shall have an aggregate
coverage limit over the term of such policy in an amount not to exceed the
annual aggregate coverage limit under the Companys existing trustees and
officers liability policy, and in all other respects shall be comparable to
such existing coverage); _provided_ , _further_ , that the annual premium
shall not exceed 300% of the annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the
Company for such insurance.

 

(e) The Covered Persons (and their successors and heirs) are intended express
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.4_, and this _Section 7.4_

amount determined by this clause (ii), the " _Maximum Company REIT Amount_ ").
The " _Parent Expense Reimbursement Amount_ " shall be an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) $20,000,000 (the " _Parent Expense Reimbursement Base Amount_ ")

the event the Company receives Tax Guidance providing that the Companys
receipt of the Parent Termination Fee Base Amount or the Parent Expense
Reimbursement Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would
be excluded from gross income within the meaning of the REIT Requirements,
the Parent Termination Fee shall be an amount equal to the Parent Termination
Fee Base Amount and/or the Parent Expense Reimbursement Amount shall be an
amount equal to the Parent Expense Reimbursement Base Amount, as applicable,
and Parent shall, upon receiving notice that the Company has received the Tax

released to Parent.

 



100 (g) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
9.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that the Company
Termination Fee and Parent Termination Fee are not a penalty, but rather are
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and
Merger Sub in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is
payable by the Company or the Company in circumstances in which the Parent
Termination Fee is payable by Parent, in each case, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of
the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, other than as set forth in _Section 9.2(a)_ and
Parents right to specific performance in accordance with _Section 10.11_,
Parents right to receive payment of the Company Termination Fee from the
Company (in circumstances where it is payable hereunder) shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future officers,
trustees, directors, partners, shareholders, managers, members, affiliates or
agents for the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated, and upon payment of such amount in accordance with _Section
9.2_, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
former, current or future officers, directors, partners, shareholders,
managers, members, affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions (including with respect to specific performance).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, other than as set
forth in _Section 9.2(a)_ and the Companys right to specific performance in
accordance with  _Section 10.11_, the Companys right to receive payment of
the Parent Termination Fee from Parent (in circumstances where it is payable
hereunder) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company against
Parent and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, shareholders, managers, members,
affiliates or agents for the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount in accordance with
_Section 9.2_, none of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective former, current or future officers, trustees, directors, partners,
shareholders, managers, members, affiliates or agents shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions (including with respect to specific performance).

respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

(b) Except as provided in _Section 7.4_, neither this Agreement (including

the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder.

 



103 Section 10.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement

modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Merger are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
brought by any Party, (b) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding
except in such courts, (c) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action
or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such Maryland state or
federal court, (d) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding, and (e) waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding. Each of the Parties agrees that a
final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process
in the manner provided for notices in _Section 10.4_. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law.

Section 10.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF

AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
MERGER AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER

written consent of the other Parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in
its sole discretion and without the consent of any other Party, any or all of
its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent. Subject to the preceding
sentence, but without relieving any Party of any obligation hereunder, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 10.11 _Enforcement; Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and
the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that

injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by any other Party and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

 

(c) The Parties right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to the grant of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches of
this Agreement by any other Party (including any objection on the basis that
there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance
is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity), and each Party

Properties, a Maryland real estate investment trust, which owns, directly or
indirectly, 100% of the partnership interests in the initial Member. In the
event of an assignment of any Membership Interest in the Company (including
any Membership Interest held by the Manager), the Manager then serving shall
continue as Manager of the Company.

5.1.1  _Powers of Manager_. Subject to the rights of Members expressly
provided herein (including in Section 5.2), the Manager shall have the
exclusive right and power to manage and control the business and affairs of
the Company and to direct the exercise of all of the powers of the Company
under the Act and this Agreement and the performance of all lawful acts of the
Company which are not specified by this Agreement or required by a nonwaivable
provision the Act to be exercised or performed exclusively by or with the
approval of any Member or Members. Except as expressly provided otherwise in
this Agreement or as required by a nonwaiveable provision of the Act, the
Manager shall have sole and exclusive power to approve or consent to all
matters that require the approval or consent of the members of the

 



\- 4 -  Company (so that the approval of the Manager will constitute all required
member approval) and no Member will have any right to vote on such matter and
such acts shall be subject only to the approval of the Manager. Except as
expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, wherever the Act requires that
any action be taken with the unanimous consent or approval of the members of
the Company, that shall mean, rather than the consent or approval of all
Members, the consent or approval of the Manager. To the extent that,
notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, any nonwaiveable provision of
the Act requires that any action be taken with the consent or approval of any
Member or Members, that shall mean, in addition to the consent or approval of
such Member or Members, the consent or approval of the Manager. The Company
shall be bound only by the signature of the Manager or one or more agents duly
authorized by the Manager.

Company to borrow money or enter into agreements, contracts or the like, in
addition to those contemplated hereby, with the Manager, any Member, or any of
their respective affiliates, in an independent capacity, as distinguished from
their capacity (if any) as a Member, Manager or affiliate thereof. No
contract or transaction between the Company and the Manager, any of its
Members, or any of their respective affiliates, shall be void or voidable
solely for this reason, or solely because the Manager approved such
transaction, if the contract or transaction is fair to the Company as of the
time it is authorized, approved or ratified by Manager.

5.1.3  _Determinations by the Manager_. The determination as to any of the
following matters by the Manager consistent with the Act and this Agreement
shall be final and conclusive and shall be binding upon the Company and every
Member: the form, amount and timing of any distribution; the amount, purpose,
time of creation, increase or decrease, alteration or cancellation of any
reserves or charges and the propriety thereof (whether or not any obligation
or liability for which such reserves or charges shall have been created shall
have been paid or discharged); the amount of any capital account of any holder
of an Economic Interest; the amount of profit, loss or depreciation for any
period; the value of any property of the Company; any interpretation of the
terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers or rights,
restrictions, limitations as to allocations and distributions, qualifications
or terms or conditions of redemption of any Persons interest in the Company;
any matter relating to the acquisition, holding and disposition of any
property of the Company; or any other matter relating to the business and
affairs of the Company or required or permitted by applicable law, this
Agreement or otherwise to be determined by the Manager.

5.1.4 _Term of Manager; Replacement Manager_. A Manager shall serve in such
capacity until the earlier of (a) such Managers resignation and designation
of a successor Manager by written notification to the Company (which
resignation and designation will be effective upon receipt by the Company of
such notification unless a later time is specified in the notification) or
(b) the Managers inability to continue to serve in such capacity. The Manager
or, if the Manager shall fail to appoint its replacement prior to the end of
its term as Manager, its successor or representative, shall have the
exclusive power to appoint a successor Manager.

Section 5.2 _Restrictions on the Powers of the Manager_. The Manager may not,
without the approval of the Members, approve or authorize any amendment to
this Agreement

 



\- 5 -  that would materially and adversely affect the contract rights of the
Members hereunder. The issuance of additional Membership Interests in the
Company, and the amendment of this Agreement to reflect the terms,
preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers or rights,
restrictions, limitations as to allocations and distributions, qualifications
or terms or conditions of redemption of any such Membership Interest shall not
be deemed to materially or adversely affect the contract rights of the
Members (including to the extent that any such new Membership Interests may
have rights as to distributions, allocations of profits or losses or upon
liquidation that are senior to those of the such Members), and no such Member
shall have any right to vote on or consent to any such issuance or amendment.

 

Section 5.3 _Compensation of Manager_. The Manager shall be entitled to
compensation for its services to the Company and shall be entitled to
reimbursement for all reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the
Company business, including, without limitation, all legal and accounting
expenses incurred on behalf of the Company or in connection with the discharge
of its duties to the Company.

Section 5.4 _Duties and Obligations of Manager_. To the maximum extent
permitted under the Act, the only duty that the Manager owes to the Company,
any Member or any other Person (including any creditor of any Member or
assignee of any interest in the Company), fiduciary or otherwise, are to
perform its contractual obligations as expressly set forth in this Agreement
consistently with the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair
dealing, in accordance with the duties of care and loyalty as set forth in
this Section 5.4. The Manager, in its capacity as such, shall have no
other duty, fiduciary or otherwise, to the Company, its Members or any other
Person (including any creditor of any Member or any assignee of any Membership
Interest in the Company).

 

5.4.1 _Duty of Care_. The Managers duty of care to the Company and its
Members is limited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or
willful misconduct in the discharge of its contractual obligations as
expressly set forth in this Agreement. None of the Manager or its agents or
affiliates shall be expected to devote his, her or its full time to the
performance of such duties.

5.4.2 _Duty of Loyalty_. The Managers duty of loyalty to the Company and its
Members is limited to refraining from appropriating the property or assets of
the Company to the benefit of the Manager or any other Person and without
benefit to the Company, and is further subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 5.7. An action of the Manager does not violate the Managers duty of
loyalty solely because the Managers conduct also furthers the Managers own
interests.

5.5  _Limitation on Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by law, none
of the Manager or its agents or affiliates, or any officer, employee or agent
of the Company, shall be liable, responsible or accountable, in liabilities,
damages or otherwise, to any Member, to the Company or any other Person
(including any creditor of any Member or assignee of any Membership Interest
in the Company), including damages arising in tort or for breach of contract
or breach of fiduciary or other duties, by reason of any act or omission by
such person on behalf of the Company, except for fraud, intentional harm or
gross negligence on the part of such Manager.

 



\- 6 - 5.6 _Powers and Duties of Members_. No Member is an agent of the Company
solely by virtue of being a Member, and no Member has authority to act for
the Company solely by virtue of being a Member. This Section 5.6 supersedes
any authority granted to the Members pursuant to Section 4A-401 of the Act.
Any Member who takes any action or binds the Company in violation of this
Section 5.6 shall be solely responsible for any loss and expense incurred by
the Company as a result of the unauthorized action and shall indemnify and
hold the Company harmless with respect to the loss or expense. Except as
specifically set forth herein, no Member is required to perform services for
the Company solely by virtue of being a Member. No Member, in such Members
capacity as such and regardless of such Members relative Percentage, shall
have any duty, fiduciary or otherwise, to any other Member or Members or any
other Person (including any creditor of any Member or any assignee of any
Membership Interest in the Company).

 

5.7 _Corporate Opportunities_. The Manager, any Member and any agent or
affiliate thereof may engage in or possess an interest in any other business
ventures of any nature or description, independently or with others, similar
or dissimilar to the business of the Company, and neither the Company nor any
Member shall have any rights by virtue of this Agreement or the
relationship created hereby in or to any other ventures or activities engaged
in by the Manager, any Member or any agent or affiliate thereof or to the
income or proceeds derived therefrom, and the pursuit of such ventures or
activities by the Manager, any Member or any agent or affiliate thereof shall
not violate the duties of any such Person, even to the extent the same are
competitive with the business activities of the Company. None of the Manager,
any Member or any agent or affiliate thereof shall be obligated to present
any particular investment or business opportunity to the Company even if such
opportunity is of a character which, if presented to the Company, could be
taken by the Company, and the Manager, any Member and any agent or affiliate
thereof shall have the right to take for its own account (individually or as a
partner, member or fiduciary) or to recommend to others any such particular
opportunity. No action of the Manager, any Member or any of their agents
or affiliates, with respect to any such other business venture, activity or
opportunity shall constitute a breach of the duties, fiduciary or otherwise,
of the Manager or any Member or any other Person.

 

Section 5.8 _Indemnification_.

 

5.8.1. _Indemnification Generally_. The Company shall indemnify any present or
former Member or Manager, and any other Person who is or was serving at the
request of the Company as a member, director, officer, partner, venturer,
proprietor, trustee, employee, agent, or similar functionary of another
Person, and their respective legal representatives (each, an
"Indemnified Person"), against any and all claims and demands to the fullest
extent permitted by law. The rights granted pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall
be contract rights and shall vest immediately upon the appointment of any
Person to the position giving rise to its, his or her right to
indemnification hereunder, and no amendment, modification, or repeal of this
Agreement or the Articles shall have the effect of limiting or denying any
such rights with respect to actions taken or omitted or proceedings arising
before any such amendment, modification or repeal, and indemnification under
this Section 5.8 shall continue as to an Indemnified Person who has ceased to
serve in the capacity which initially entitled such Indemnified Person to
indemnity hereunder.

 



\- 7 - 5.8.2 _Advance Payment_. In addition to the indemnification required by
Section 5.8.1, the Company shall pay or reimburse each Indemnified Person any
and all reasonable expenses incurred by an Indemnified Person without
requiring a preliminary determination of such Indemnified Persons entitlement
to indemnification under Section 5.8.1, within ten days of written demand
therefor and upon delivery to the Company of a written affirmation by such
Indemnified Person of the Indemnified Persons good faith belief that the
Indemnified Person has met the standard of conduct necessary for
indemnification under Section 5.8.1 and a written, unsecured undertaking, by
or on behalf of such Indemnified Person, to repay all amounts so advanced if
it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Person is not
entitled to indemnification therefor.

5.8.3 _Indemnification of Employees and Agents_. The Company shall indemnify
and advance expenses to an officer, employee or agent of the Company to the
same extent and subject to the same conditions under which it may indemnify
and advance expenses to an Indemnified Person under Section 5.8.1 and Section
5.8.2.

 

5.8.4 _Nonexclusivity of Rights_. The right to indemnification and the
advancement and payment of expenses conferred in this Section 5.8 shall not
be exclusive of any other right which any Indemnified Person indemnified may
have or hereafter acquire under any law (common or statutory), the Articles,
this Agreement, any other agreement, vote of Members, action of the Manager
or otherwise.

5.8.5 _Savings Clause_. If this Section 5.8 or any portion hereof shall be
invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Company shall nevertheless indemnify and hold harmless the Manager, each
Member and each other Indemnified Person to the full extent permitted by any
portion of this Section 5.8 that shall not have been invalidated and to the
fullest extent permitted by law.

ARTICLE VI

 

 _Dissolution, Liquidation and Termination of the Company_

 

6.1 _Events of Dissolution_. The Company shall be dissolved:

 

6.1.1 upon the decision of the Manager to dissolve the Company;

 

6.1.2 at the time specified by the unanimous consent of the Members, if any,
holding Non-Economic Interests in the Company; or

 

6.1.3 upon the judicial dissolution of the Company or as otherwise required by
a nonwaiveable provision of the Act.

 

Notwithstanding anything in the Act to the contrary, if at any time or for any
period of time the Company has no Members, the Company shall not be
dissolved and the Company shall continue

 



\- 8 -  in perpetuity until dissolved in accordance with this Article VI. If any
court or arbitrator shall determine that the continuation of the Company in
perpetuity, notwithstanding that the Company may have had no Members for a
period of time, is unenforceable in accordance with its terms, it is the
intention of the parties that such provision shall be deemed to be amended to
provide that the Company shall not be dissolved if, within 90 days after such
determination (or within such shorter time period as may be necessary to
render such provision valid and enforceable), the Manager admits any Person as
a Member, such admission to be effective as of the time the last remaining
Member ceased to be a Member.

6.2 _Procedure for Winding Up and Dissolution_. If the Company is dissolved,
the Manager shall wind up its affairs. On winding up of the Company, the
assets of the Company shall be distributed, first, to creditors of the
Company, including any Member if such Member is a creditor, in satisfaction of
the liabilities of the Company, and then to the Members in proportion to
their respective capital accounts.

6.3 _Filing of Articles of Cancellation_. If the Company is dissolved,
the Manager shall promptly file articles of cancellation with SDAT.

ARTICLE VII

 

 _Transfers of Membership Interests_

 

7.1 _Restriction on Transfers of Membership Interests_. Except as expressly
set forth in this Article VII, no Member may transfer all or any portion of
its Membership Interest, directly or indirectly, without the prior written
consent of the Manager (which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole
and absolute discretion of the Manager), to any Person. Any purported transfer
of any Membership Interest or any portion thereof in contravention of this
Article VII shall be null and void and of no force and effect. Except as
expressly set forth in this Article VII, no transfer shall relieve the Member
transferring its Membership Interest of any obligations and liabilities to
the Company under this Agreement. Each Member hereby acknowledges the
reasonableness of the prohibition contained in this Section 7.1 in view of the
purposes of the Company.

 

7.2 _Admission of Transferee; No Membership Rights of Assignee_. Except as
expressly set forth in Section 7.3, in the event of any transfer of an
Economic Interest in the Company (whether or not such transfer complies with
this Article VII), the transferee of the Members interest (an "Assignee")
shall not be admitted as a Member of the Company without: (i) the consent of
the Manager to the admission of the Assignee as a Member of the Company (which
consent may be granted or withheld in the sole and absolute discretion of the
Manager); (ii) the Assignees agreement to be bound by the provisions of this
Agreement; and (iii) such other agreements, undertakings, opinions and other
documents as the Manager may require. Upon the transfer of a Members entire
Economic Interest (and, if such transferor is the sole remaining Member of
the Company, the admission of an Assignee as a Member of the Company in
accordance with this Section 7.2), the transferor will cease automatically to
be a Member of the Company, or to have any rights, obligations, or liabilities
with respect to the Company, with respect to the Membership Interest so
assigned. Unless admitted as a Member, an Assignee is

 



\- 9 -  entitled to receive only the transferring Members Economic Interest (the
"Assigned Interest"), and shall not receive or be deemed to receive any other
or further rights or interest in and to the Company or its assets.
Specifically but without limitation, an Assignee shall not:

7.2.1 become a Member of the Company or be entitled to exercise any of the
Non-Economic Interest of the transferor except as expressly provided in
Sections 7.2 or 7.3;

 

7.2.2 have any right to be admitted as Member of the Company or any right to
elect to become a Member of the Company; or

 

7.2.3 have any of the rights, powers or obligations of a Member of the
Company, except for those rights expressly included in the Assigned Interest.

7.3 _Permitted Transfers_. A Member may, without the consent of the Manager,
transfer all or any portion of its interest to any entity, the equity
interests in which are, directly or indirectly, owned entirely by the Member
(a "Permitted Transferee") or to any other Member. Upon any transfer of an
interest in the Company in accordance with this Section 7.3 and, in the case
of a transfer to a Permitted Transferee, the Managers receipt of the
Permitted Transferees written agreement to be bound by this Agreement, the
Permitted Transferee will be admitted automatically as a Member with respect
to the Membership Interest in the Company so assigned without any further
consent, approval, or other act of the Manager or any other Person, the
transferee will succeed, automatically, to all of the transferors
rights, powers, and obligations as Member under this Agreement and the
transferor will cease automatically to be a Member of the Company, or to have
any rights, obligations, or liabilities with respect to the Company, with
respect to the Membership Interest so assigned.

7.4 _Voluntary Withdrawal_. Except as provided in Section 7.2 or 7.3 in
connection with a transfer of its entire Economic Interest, no Member may
voluntarily withdraw from the Company.

7.5 _Involuntary Withdrawal_. Upon the occurrence with respect to a Member of
any Involuntary Withdrawal, such Person shall cease automatically to be a
Member of the Company and such Person (or its successor in interest) shall
have only the rights of an Assignee with respect to such former
Members Economic Interest. If all of the Members have ceased to be Members
of the Company, the Manager may, in its sole and exclusive discretion, admit
or readmit any Person as a Member of the Company.

and at a time mutually convenient to such Member and the Manager, have access
to the books and records of the Company for examination thereof at the
Companys principal office for any proper purpose reasonably related to the
Members Membership Interest. No person who is not admitted as a Member of
the Company shall have any right to inspect or copy the books and records of

its name.

8.4.2 The Manager may direct that legal title to all or any portion of the
Companys property be acquired or held in a name other than the Companys
name. Without limiting the foregoing, the Manager may cause title to be
acquired and held in its name or in the names of trustees or nominees for the
Company. It is expressly understood and agreed that the manner of holding
title to the Companys property (or any part thereof) is solely for the
convenience of the Company, and all of that property shall be treated as
Company property.

3,500,000

7.125% SERIES A CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SHARES

[ ], 2015 

Chambers Street Properties, a Maryland real estate investment trust (the "
_Trust_ "), hereby certifies to the State Department of Assessments and
Taxation of Maryland (the " _Department_ ") that:

_FIRST_ : Pursuant to the authority expressly vested in the Board of Trustees
of the Trust (the " _Board of Trustees_ ") by Article VI of the Trusts
declaration of trust (the " _Declaration_ ") and Section 8-203 of the Maryland
REIT Law, the Board of Trustees duly adopted resolutions on [ ],
2015, (i) classifying and designating 3,500,000 authorized but unissued
preferred shares of beneficial interest of the Trust, par value $0.01 per
share (" _Preferred Shares_ "), as a separate series of Preferred Shares, to
be known as the "7.125% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares," and
(ii) setting the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers,
restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, transfers,
qualifications, terms and conditions of redemption and other terms and
conditions of such 7.125% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares.

_SECOND_ : The designation, number of shares, preferences, rights, voting
powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions,
qualifications, terms and conditions of redemption and other terms and
conditions of the separate series of Preferred Shares of the Trust designated
as the 7.125% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares are as follows,
which upon any restatement of the Declaration shall be made a part of or
incorporated by reference into the Declaration with any necessary or
appropriate changes to the enumeration or lettering of Sections or subsections
thereof:

 

 _7.125% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares_

 

Section 1\. _Designation and Number_. A series of Preferred Shares, designated
the "7.125% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares" (the " _Series A
Preferred Shares_ "), is hereby established. The par value of the Series A
Preferred Shares is $0.01 per share. The number of Series A Preferred Shares
shall be 3,500,000.

 

Section 2\. _Rank_. The Series A Preferred Shares will, with respect to
dividend rights and rights upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Trust, rank: (a) senior to all classes or
series of the Trusts common shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01
per share (the " _Common Shares_ "), and all classes or series of beneficial
interest of the Trust now or hereafter authorized, issued or outstanding
expressly designated as ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Shares as to
dividend rights and rights upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Trust; (b) on parity with all classes or
series of beneficial interest of the Trust now or hereafter authorized,
issued, or outstanding expressly designated as ranking on parity with the
Series A Preferred Shares as to dividend rights and rights upon voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Trust; and (c)
junior to any class or series of beneficial interest of the Trust expressly
designated as ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Shares as to dividend
rights and rights upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Trust. The term " _beneficial interest_ " does not include
convertible or exchangeable debt securities, which will rank senior to the
Series A Preferred Shares prior to conversion or exchange. The Series A
Preferred Shares will also rank junior in right of payment to the Trusts
other existing and future debt obligations. Section 3\. _Dividends_.

 

(a) Subject to the preferential rights of the holders of any class or series
of beneficial interest of the Trust ranking senior to the Series A Preferred
Shares as to dividends, holders of Series A Preferred Shares shall be entitled
to receive, when, as and if authorized by the Board of Trustees and declared
by the Trust, out of funds legally available for the payment of
dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 7.125% per annum of the
$25.00 liquidation preference per Series A Preferred Share (equivalent to a
fixed annual amount of $1.78125 per Series A Preferred Share). Such dividends
shall accrue and be cumulative from and including [ ] (the "
_Original Issue Date_ ") and shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each
Dividend Payment Date (as defined below), commencing [ ];
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any Dividend Payment Date is not a Business
Day (as defined below), then the dividend which would otherwise have
been payable on such Dividend Payment Date may be paid on the next succeeding
Business Day, except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding
calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding
Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if paid on such
Dividend Payment Date, and no interest or additional dividends or other sums
shall accrue on the amount so payable from such Dividend Payment Date to such
next succeeding Business Day. The amount of any dividend payable on the
Series A Preferred Shares for any Dividend Period (as defined below) shall be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
Dividends will be payable to holders of record as they appear in
the shareholder records of the Trust at the close of business on the
applicable Dividend Record Date (as defined below). Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary contained herein, each outstanding Series A
Preferred Share shall be entitled to receive a dividend with respect to any
Dividend Record Date equal to the dividend paid with respect to each other
Series A Preferred Share that is outstanding on such date. " _Dividend Record
Date_ " shall mean the date designated by the Board of Trustees for the
payment of dividends that is not more than 35 or fewer than 10 days prior to
the applicable Dividend Payment Date. " _Dividend Payment Date_ " shall mean
the last calendar day of each March, June, September and December, commencing
on [ ]. " _Dividend Period_ " shall mean the respective periods
commencing on and including the first day of January, April, July and October
of each year and ending on and including the day preceding the first day of
the next succeeding Dividend Period (other than the initial Dividend Period,
which shall commence on the Original Issue Date and end on and include [
], and other than the Dividend Period during which any Series A Preferred
Shares shall be redeemed, converted or otherwise reacquired pursuant to
Section 5 or Section 6, which shall end on and include the day preceding the
redemption date, conversion date or reacquisition date with respect to the
Series A Preferred Shares being redeemed, converted or otherwise reacquired).

 

The term " _Business Day_ " shall mean each day, other than a Saturday or a
Sunday, which is not a day on which banking institutions in New York, New
York are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to
close.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, dividends on
the Series A Preferred Shares shall accrue whether or not the Trust has
earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of
such dividends, and whether or not such dividends are authorized or declared.

(c) Except as provided in Section 3(d) below, no dividends shall be declared
and paid or declared and set apart for payment, and no other distribution of
cash or other property may be declared and made, directly or indirectly, on or
with respect to, any Common Shares or shares of any other class or series of
beneficial interest of the Trust ranking, as to dividends, on parity with or
junior to the Series A Preferred Shares (other than a dividend paid in Common
Shares or in shares of any other class or series of beneficial interest
ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Shares as to payment of dividends
and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Trust or in options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase any
such shares of beneficial interest) for any period, nor shall any Common
Shares or any other shares of any other class or series of beneficial interest
of the Trust ranking, as to payment of dividends and the distribution of
assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Trust, on parity
with or junior to the Series A Preferred Shares be redeemed, purchased or
otherwise acquired for any consideration, nor shall any funds be paid or made
available for a sinking fund for the redemption of such shares (except by
conversion into or exchange for other shares of any class or series of
beneficial interest of the Trust ranking junior to the Series A Preferred
Shares as to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Trust, and except for the
acquisition of shares made pursuant to the provisions of Article VII of the
Declaration, and the purchase or acquisition of shares of any other class or
series of beneficial interest of the Trust ranking on parity with the
Series A Preferred Shares as to payment of dividends

 



-2-  and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Trust pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms
to holders of all outstanding Series A Preferred Shares), unless full
cumulative dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares for all past Dividend
Periods that have ended shall have been or contemporaneously are (i) declared
and paid in cash or (ii) declared and a sum sufficient for the payment
thereof in cash is set apart for such payment.

(d) When dividends are not paid in full (and a sum sufficient for such full
payment is not so set apart) on the Series A Preferred Shares and the shares
of any other class or series of beneficial interest ranking, as to dividends,
on parity with the Series A Preferred Shares, all dividends declared upon the
Series A Preferred Shares and each such other class or series of beneficial
interest ranking, as to dividends, on parity with the Series A Preferred
Shares shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared and
paid per Series A Preferred Share and such other class or series of
beneficial interest shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that
accrued dividends per Series A Preferred Share and such other class or series
of beneficial interest (which shall not include any accrual in respect of
unpaid dividends on such other class or series of beneficial interest for
prior dividend periods if such other class or series of beneficial interest
does not have a cumulative dividend) bear to each other. No interest, or
sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend
payment or payments on the Series A Preferred Shares which may be in arrears.

 

(e) Holders of Series A Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to any
dividend, whether payable in cash, property or shares of beneficial interest,
in excess of full cumulative dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares as
provided herein. Any dividend payment made on the Series A Preferred Shares
shall first be credited against the earliest accrued but unpaid dividends due
with respect to such Series A Preferred Shares which remain payable. Accrued
but unpaid distributions on the Series A Preferred Shares will accumulate as
of the Dividend Payment Date on which they first become payable.

 

Section 4\. _Liquidation Preference_.

 

(a) Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Trust, before any distribution or payment shall be made to holders of
Common Shares or any other class or series of beneficial interest of the Trust
ranking, as to rights upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Trust, junior to the Series A Preferred
Shares, the holders of Series A Preferred Shares shall be entitled to be paid
out of the assets of the Trust legally available for distribution to its
shareholders, after payment of or provision for the debts and other
liabilities of the Trust, a liquidation preference of $25.00 per Series A
Preferred Share, plus an amount per Series A Preferred Share equal to all
accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not authorized or declared) to but
excluding the date of payment. In the event that, upon such voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the available assets of
the Trust are insufficient to pay the full amount of the liquidating
distributions on all outstanding Series A Preferred Shares and the
corresponding amounts payable on all shares of other classes or series of
beneficial interest of the Trust ranking, as to rights upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Trust, on parity with the Series A Preferred
Shares in the distribution of assets, then the holders of Series A Preferred
Shares and each such other class or series of shares of beneficial interest
ranking, as to rights upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Trust, on parity with the Series A Preferred
Shares shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to
the full liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be
respectively entitled. Written notice of any such voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Trust, stating the payment date
or dates when, and the place or places where, the amounts distributable in
such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by first class mail,
postage pre-paid, not fewer than 30 or more than 60 days prior to the payment
date stated therein, to each record holder of Series A Preferred Shares at the
respective addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the share
transfer records of the Trust. After payment of the full amount of the
liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of Series A
Preferred Shares will have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of
the Trust. The consolidation or merger of the Trust with or into any other
corporation, trust or entity, or the voluntary sale, lease, transfer or
conveyance of all or substantially all of the property or business of the
Trust, shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Trust. 

(b) In determining whether a distribution (other than upon voluntary or
involuntary liquidation), by dividend, redemption or other acquisition of
shares of beneficial interest of the Trust or otherwise, is permitted under
the Maryland law, amounts that would be needed, if the Trust were to be
dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights
upon dissolution of holders of Series A Preferred Shares shall not be added
to the Trusts total liabilities.

 



-3- Section 5\. _Redemption_.

 

(a) Series A Preferred Shares shall not be redeemable prior to August 15,
2019, except as set forth in Section 6 or to preserve the status of the Trust
as a REIT (as defined in Article III of the Declaration) for United States
federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Series A Preferred Shares shall
be subject to the provisions of Article VII of the Declaration.

 

(b) On and after August 15, 2019, the Trust, at its option upon not fewer than
30 or more than 60 days written notice, may redeem the Series A Preferred
Shares, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, for cash at a
redemption price of $25.00 per Series A Preferred Share, plus all accrued and
unpaid dividends (whether or not authorized or declared) thereon up to, but
not including, the date fixed for redemption, without interest, to the extent
the Trust has funds legally available therefor (the " _Redemption Right_ ").
If fewer than all of the outstanding Series A Preferred Shares are to be
redeemed, the Series A Preferred Shares to be redeemed shall be redeemed pro
rata (as nearly as may be practicable without creating fractional Series A
Preferred Shares) by lot or by any other equitable method determined by the
Trust that will not result in a violation of the Preferred Share Ownership
Limit (as defined in Article VII of the Declaration). If redemption is to be
by lot and, as a result, any holder of Series A Preferred Shares would have
actual ownership, Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership (each as
defined in Article VII of the Declaration) in excess of the Preferred Share
Ownership Limit (as defined in Article VII of the Declaration), or such other
limit as permitted by the Board of Trustees pursuant to Article VII of the
Declaration, because such holders Series A Preferred Shares were not
redeemed, or were only redeemed in part, then, except as otherwise provided in
the Declaration, the Trust shall redeem the requisite number of Series A
Preferred Shares of such holder such that no holder will hold an amount of
Series A Preferred Shares in excess of the Preferred Share Ownership Limit,
subsequent to such redemption. Holders of Series A Preferred Shares to be
redeemed shall surrender such Series A Preferred Shares at the place, or in
accordance with the book entry procedures, designated in such notice and shall
be entitled to the redemption price of $25.00 per Series A Preferred Share and
all accrued and unpaid dividends payable upon such redemption following such
surrender. If (i) notice of redemption of any Series A Preferred Shares has
been given (in the case of a redemption of the Series A Preferred Shares other
than to preserve the status of the Trust as a REIT), (ii) the funds necessary
for such redemption have been set apart by the Trust in trust for the benefit
of the holders of any Series A Preferred Shares so called for redemption, and
(iii) irrevocable instructions have been given to pay the redemption price
and all accrued and unpaid dividends, then from and after the redemption date,
dividends shall cease to accrue on such Series A Preferred Shares, such Series
A Preferred Shares shall no longer be deemed outstanding, and all rights of
the holders of such Series A Preferred Shares shall terminate, except the
right to receive the redemption price plus any accrued and unpaid dividends
payable upon such redemption, without interest. So long as full
cumulative dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares for all past Dividend
Periods that have ended shall have been or contemporaneously are (i) declared
and paid in cash, or (ii) declared and a sum sufficient for the payment
thereof in cash is set apart for payment, nothing herein shall prevent or
restrict the Trusts right or ability to purchase, from time to time, either
at a public or a private sale, all or any part of the Series A Preferred
Shares at such price or prices as the Trust may determine, subject to the
provisions of applicable law, including the repurchase of Series A Preferred
Shares in open-market transactions duly authorized by the Board of Trustees.

 

(c) In the event of any redemption of the Series A Preferred Shares in order
to preserve the status of the Trust as a REIT for United States federal
income tax purposes, such redemption shall be made in accordance with the
terms and conditions set forth in this Section 5\. If the Trust calls for
redemption any Series A Preferred Shares pursuant to and in accordance with
this Section 5(c), then the redemption price for such Series A Preferred
Shares will be an amount in cash equal to $25.00 per Series A Preferred Share
together with all accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the
dated fixed for redemption.

(d) Unless full cumulative dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares for all
past Dividend Periods that have ended shall have been or contemporaneously
are (i) declared and paid in cash, or (ii) declared and a sum sufficient for
the payment thereof in cash is set apart for payment, no Series A Preferred
Shares shall be redeemed pursuant to the Redemption Right or Special Optional
Redemption Right (defined below) unless all outstanding Series A Preferred
Shares are simultaneously redeemed, and the Trust shall not purchase or
otherwise acquire directly or 

 



-4-  indirectly any Series A Preferred Shares or any class or series of
beneficial interest of the Trust ranking, as to payment of dividends and the
distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Trust, on parity with or junior to the Series A Preferred Shares (except by
conversion into or exchange for shares of beneficial interest of the Trust
ranking, as to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Trust, junior to the Series A
Preferred Shares); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
prevent the purchase of Series A Preferred Shares, or any other class or
series of beneficial interest of the Trust ranking, as to payment of
dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Trust, on parity with or junior to the Series A Preferred
Shares, by the Trust in accordance with the terms of Sections 5(c) and 9
hereof or otherwise, in order to ensure that the Trust remains qualified as a
REIT for United States federal income tax purposes, or the purchase or
acquisition of Series A Preferred Shares or shares of any other class or
series of beneficial interest of the Trust ranking on parity with the Series A
Preferred Shares as to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Trust pursuant to a
purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all
outstanding Series A Preferred Shares.

(e) Notice of redemption pursuant to the Redemption Right will be mailed by
the Trust, postage prepaid, not fewer than 30 or more than 60 days prior to
the redemption date, addressed to the respective holders of record of the
Series A Preferred Shares to be redeemed at their respective addresses as
they appear on the transfer records of the Trust. No failure to give or defect
in such notice shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption
of any Series A Preferred Shares except as to the holder to whom such notice
was defective or not given. In addition to any information required by law or
by the applicable rules of any exchange upon which the Series A Preferred
Shares may be listed or admitted to trading, each such notice shall
state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the number
of Series A Preferred Shares to be redeemed; (iv) the place or places where
the certificates, if any, evidencing Series A Preferred Shares are to be
surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (v) procedures for
surrendering noncertificated Series A Preferred Shares for payment of the
redemption price; (vi) that dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares to be
redeemed will cease to accrue on such redemption date; and (vii) that payment
of the redemption price and any accrued and unpaid dividends will be made upon
presentation and surrender of such Series A Preferred Shares. If fewer than
all of the Series A Preferred Shares held by any holder are to be redeemed,
the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of Series A
Preferred Shares held by such holder to be redeemed or the method for
determining such number. Notwithstanding anything else to the
contrary herein, the Trust shall not be required to provide notice to the
holder of Series A Preferred Shares in the event such holders Series A
Preferred Shares are redeemed in accordance with Section 5(c) hereof and
Article VII of the Declaration to preserve the Trusts status as a REIT.

(f) If a redemption date falls after a Dividend Record Date and on or prior
to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, each holder of Series A Preferred
Shares at the close of business of such Dividend Record Date shall be entitled
to the dividend payable on such Series A Preferred Shares on the
corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the redemption of such
Series A Preferred Shares on or prior to such Dividend Payment Date, and each
holder of Series A Preferred Shares that surrenders its Series A Preferred
Shares on such redemption date will be entitled to the dividends accruing
after the end of the Dividend Period to which such Dividend Payment Date
relates up to, but not including, the redemption date. Except as provided
herein, the Trust shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends,
whether or not in arrears, on Series A Preferred Shares for which a notice of
redemption has been given.

(g) All Series A Preferred Shares redeemed or repurchased pursuant to this
Section 5, or otherwise acquired in any other manner by the Trust, shall be
retired and shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued
Preferred Shares, without designation as to series or class.

(h) The Series A Preferred Shares shall have no stated maturity and shall not
be subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Series A Preferred Shares owned by a shareholder in
excess of the Preferred Share Ownership Limit shall be subject to the
provisions of this Section 5 and Article VII of the Declaration.

Section 6\. _Special Optional Redemption by the Trust_.

 

(a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Trust
will have the option upon written notice mailed by the Trust, postage pre-
paid, no fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption

 



-5-  date and addressed to the holders of record of Series A Preferred Shares to
be redeemed at their respective addresses as they appear on the share transfer
records of the Trust, to redeem Series A Preferred Shares, in whole or in
part within 120 days after the first date on which such Change of Control
occurred, for cash at $25.00 per Series A Preferred Share plus accrued and
unpaid dividends, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date ("
_Special Optional Redemption Right_ "). No failure to give such notice or any
defect thereto or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the
proceedings for the redemption of any Series A Preferred Shares except as
to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. If, prior to the
Change of Control Conversion Date (as defined below), the Trust has provided
or provides notice of redemption with respect to the Series A Preferred Shares
(whether pursuant to the Redemption Right or the Special Optional Redemption
Right), the holders of Series A Preferred Shares will not have the conversion
right described below in Section 8\.

 

A " _Change of Control_ " is when, after the Original Issue Date, the
following have occurred and are continuing:

 

(i) the acquisition by any person, including any syndicate or group deemed to
be a "person" under Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), of beneficial ownership, directly or
indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or
series of purchases, mergers or other acquisition transactions of shares of
beneficial interest of the Trust entitling that person to exercise more than
50% of the total voting power of all shares of beneficial interest of the
Trust entitled to vote generally in the election of the Trusts trustees
(except that such person will be deemed to have beneficial ownership of all
securities that such person has the right to acquire, whether such right is
currently exercisable or is exercisable only upon the occurrence of a
subsequent condition); and

(ii) following the closing of any transaction referred to in (i) above,
neither the Trust nor the acquiring or surviving entity has a class of common
securities (or American Depositary Receipts representing such securities)
listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "), the NYSE MKT LLC
("NYSE MKT"), or the NASDAQ Stock Market (" _NASDAQ_ "), or listed or quoted
on an exchange or quotation system that is a successor to the NYSE, the NYSE
MKT or NASDAQ.

 

(b) In addition to any information required by law or by the applicable rules
of any exchange upon which the Series A Preferred Shares may be listed or
admitted to trading, such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii)
the redemption price; (iii) the number of Series A Preferred Shares to be
redeemed; (iv) the place or places where the certificates, if any, evidencing
Series A Preferred Shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption
price; (v) procedures for surrendering noncertificated Series A Preferred
Shares for payment of the redemption price; (vi) that dividends on the Series
A Preferred Shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption date;
(vii) that payment of the redemption price and any accrued and unpaid
dividends will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Series
A Preferred Shares; (viii) that the Series A Preferred Shares are being
redeemed pursuant to the Special Optional Redemption Right in connection with
the occurrence of a Change of Control and a brief description of the
transaction or transactions constituting such Change of Control; and (ix)
that holders of the Series A Preferred Shares to which the notice relates will
not be able to tender such Series A Preferred Shares for conversion in
connection with the Change of Control and each Series A Preferred Share
tendered for conversion that is selected, prior to the Change of Control
Conversion Date, for redemption will be redeemed on the related redemption
date instead of converted on the Change of Control Conversion Date. If
fewer than all of the Series A Preferred Shares held by any holder are to be
redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall also specify the number of
Series A Preferred Shares held by such holder to be redeemed or the method for
determining such number.

If fewer than all of the outstanding Series A Preferred Shares are to be
redeemed pursuant to the Special Optional Redemption Right, the Series A
Preferred Shares to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as
practicable without creating fractional Series A Preferred Shares) by lot or
in such other equitable method determined by the Trust that will not result
in a violation of the Ownership Limit). If such redemption pursuant to the
Special Optional Redemption Right is to be by lot and, as a result, any holder
of Series A Preferred Shares would have actual ownership, Beneficial Ownership
or Constructive Ownership in excess of the Ownership Limit, or such limit as
permitted by the Board of Trustees pursuant to Article VII of the Declaration,
because such holders Series A Preferred Shares were not redeemed, or were
only redeemed in part then, except as otherwise provided in the Declaration,
the Trust shall redeem the requisite number of Series A Preferred Shares of
such holder such that no holder will hold an amount of Series A Preferred
Shares in excess of the Ownership Limit, subsequent to such redemption.

 



-6- (c) If the Trust has given a notice of redemption pursuant to the Special
Optional Redemption Right and has set apart sufficient funds for the
redemption in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Series A Preferred
Shares called for redemption, then from and after the redemption date, those
Series A Preferred Shares will be treated as no longer being outstanding, no
further dividends will accrue and all other rights of the holders of those
Series A Preferred Shares will terminate. The holders of those Series A
Preferred Shares will retain their right to receive the redemption price for
their Series A Preferred Shares and all accrued and unpaid dividends to, but
not including, the redemption date, without interest. So long as full
cumulative dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares for all past
dividend periods shall have been or contemporaneously are (i) declared and
paid in cash, or (ii) declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof in
cash is set apart for payment, nothing herein shall prevent or restrict the
Trusts right or ability to purchase, from time to time, either at a public
or a private sale, all or any part of the Series A Preferred Shares at such
price or prices as the Trust may determine, subject to the provisions of
applicable law, including the repurchase of Series A Preferred Shares in
open-market transactions duly authorized by the Board of Trustees.

(d) The holders of Series A Preferred Shares at the close of business on a
Dividend Record Date will be entitled to receive the dividend payable with
respect to the Series A Preferred Shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment
Date notwithstanding the redemption of the Series A Preferred Shares pursuant
to the Special Optional Redemption Right between such Dividend Record Date and
the corresponding Dividend Payment Date or the Trusts default in the payment
of the dividend due. Except as provided herein, the Trust shall make no
payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on
Series A Preferred Shares for which a notice of redemption pursuant to the
Special Optional Redemption Right has been given.

 

(e) All Series A Preferred Shares redeemed or repurchased pursuant to this
Section 6, or otherwise acquired in any other manner by the Trust, shall be
retired and shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued
Preferred Shares, without designation as to series or class.

 

Section 7\. _Voting Rights_.

 

(a) Holders of the Series A Preferred Shares shall not have any voting rights,
except as set forth in this Section 7\.

 

(b) Whenever dividends on any Series A Preferred Shares shall be in arrears
for six or more consecutive or non-consecutive quarterly periods (a "
_Preferred Dividend Default_ "), the number of trustees then constituting the
Board of Trustees shall be automatically increased by two and the holders of
such Series A Preferred Shares (voting separately as a class together with
all other classes or series of beneficial interest of the Trust ranking on
parity with the Series A Preferred Shares with respect to the payment of
dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Trust and upon which like voting rights have been conferred
and are exercisable (" _Parity Preferred_ ")) shall be entitled to vote for
the election of a total of two additional trustees of the Trust (the "
_Preferred Trustees_ "), until all dividends accumulated on such Series A
Preferred Shares and Parity Preferred for the past Dividend Periods that have
ended shall have been fully paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the
payment thereof is set apart for payment.

(c) The Preferred Trustees will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in
the election and each Preferred Trustee will serve until the next annual
meeting of shareholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and
qualifies or until such Preferred Trustees right to hold the office
terminates, whichever occurs earlier, subject to such Preferred Trustees
earlier death, disqualification, resignation or removal. The election will
take place at (i) either (A) a special meeting called in accordance with
Section 7(d) below if the request is received more than 90 days before the
date fixed for the Trusts next annual or special meeting of shareholders or
(B) the next annual or special meeting of shareholders if the request is
received within 90 days of the date fixed for the Trusts next annual or
special meeting of shareholders, and (ii) at each subsequent annual meeting of
shareholders, or special meeting held in place thereof, until all such accrued
dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares and each such class or series
of outstanding Parity Preferred have been paid in full. A dividend in respect
of Series A Preferred Shares shall be considered timely made if made within
two Business Days after the applicable Dividend Payment Date if at the time of
such late payment date there shall not be any prior Dividend Periods in
respect of which full dividends were not timely made at the applicable
Dividend Payment Date.

 



-7- (d) At any time when such voting rights shall have vested, a proper officer of
the Trust shall call or cause to be called, upon written request of holders
of record of at least 20% of the outstanding Series A Preferred Shares and
Parity Preferred, a special meeting of the holders of Series A Preferred
Shares and each class or series of Parity Preferred by mailing or causing to
be mailed to such holders a notice of such special meeting to be held not
fewer than ten or more than 45 days after the date such notice is given. The
record date for determining holders of the Series A Preferred Shares and
Parity Preferred entitled to notice of and to vote at such special meeting
will be the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the day on
which such notice is mailed. At any such annual or special meeting, all
of the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares and Parity Preferred, by
plurality vote, voting together as a single class without regard to class or
series will be entitled to elect two trustees on the basis of one vote per
$25.00 of liquidation preference to which such Series A Preferred Shares and
Parity Preferred are entitled by their terms (excluding amounts in respect of
accumulated and unpaid dividends) and not cumulatively. The holder or holders
of one-third of the Series A Preferred Shares and Parity Preferred voting as
a single class then outstanding, present in person or by proxy, will
constitute a quorum for the election of the Preferred Trustees except as
otherwise provided by law. Notice of all meetings at which holders of the
Series A Preferred Shares and the Parity Preferred shall be entitled to vote
will be given to such holders at their addresses as they appear in the
transfer records. At any such meeting or adjournment thereof in the absence of
a quorum, subject to the provisions of any applicable law, a majority of the
holders of the Series A Preferred Shares and Parity Preferred voting as a
single class present in person or by proxy shall have the power to adjourn the
meeting for the election of the Preferred Trustees, without notice other than
an announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present. If a Preferred
Dividend Default shall terminate after the notice of a special meeting has
been given but before such special meeting has been held, the Trust shall, as
soon as practicable after such termination, mail or cause to be mailed notice
of such termination to holders of the Series A Preferred Shares and the Parity
Preferred that would have been entitled to vote at such special meeting.

(e) If and when all accrued dividends on such Series A Preferred Shares and
all classes or series of Parity Preferred for the past dividend periods shall
have been fully paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof
is set apart for payment, the right of the holders of Series A Preferred
Shares and the Parity Preferred to elect such additional two trustees shall
immediately cease (subject to revesting in the event of each and every
Preferred Dividend Default), and the term of office of each Preferred Trustees
so elected shall terminate and the number of trustees shall be automatically
reduced accordingly. Any Preferred Trustee may be removed at any time with or
without cause by the vote of, and shall not be removed otherwise than by the
vote of, the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding Series A
Preferred Shares and the Parity Preferred entitled to vote thereon when they
have the voting rights set forth in Section 7(b) (voting together as a single
class). So long as a Preferred Dividend Default shall continue, any vacancy in
the office of a Preferred Trustee may be filled by written consent of the
Preferred Trustee remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote
of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding Series A Preferred
Shares when they have the voting rights described above (voting as a single
class with all other classes or series of Parity Preferred). Each of the
Preferred Trustees shall be entitled to one vote on any matter.

 

(f) So long as any Series A Preferred Shares remain outstanding, in addition
to any other vote or consent of shareholders required by law or the
Declaration, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of two-thirds of
the outstanding shares of beneficial interest, including Series A Preferred
Shares and of each other class or series of Parity Preferred, given in person
or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting (voting together as a single
class) will be required to authorize, create or issue, or increase the number
of authorized or issued shares of, any class or series of beneficial interest
ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Shares with respect to payment of
dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Trust or reclassify any authorized shares of beneficial
interest of the Trust into such shares, or create, authorize or issue any
obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase
any such shares of beneficial interest. In addition, so long as any Series A
Preferred Shares remain outstanding, the affirmative vote or consent of the
holders of two-thirds of the Series A Preferred Shares outstanding at the
time, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting, will be
required to amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Declaration,
including the terms of the Series A Preferred Shares, whether by merger,
consolidation, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of its
assets or otherwise (an " _Event_ "), so as to materially and adversely affect
any right, preference, privilege or voting power of the Series A

 



-8-  Preferred Shares; provided, however, with respect to the occurrence of any
of the Events set forth above, so long as the Series A Preferred Shares
remains outstanding with the terms thereof materially unchanged, taking into
account that, upon the occurrence of an Event, the Trust may not be the
surviving entity, the occurrence of such Event shall not be deemed to
materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges
or voting power of Series A Preferred Shares, and in such case such holders
shall not have any voting rights with respect to the occurrence of any of the
Events set forth above; provided, further, that such vote or consent will not
be required with respect to any such amendment, alteration or repeal that
equally affects the terms of the Series A Preferred Shares and one or more
other classes or series of Parity Preferred, if such amendment, alteration or
repeal is approved by the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of two-
thirds of the Series A Preferred Shares outstanding at the time and such other
class or series of Parity Preferred, given in person or by proxy, either in
writing or at a meeting (voting together as a single class). In addition, if
the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares receive the greater of the full
trading price of the Series A Preferred Shares on the date of an Event set
forth above or the $25.00 liquidation preference per Series A Preferred Share
pursuant to the occurrence of any of the Events set forth above, then such
holders shall not have any voting rights with respect to the Events set forth
above.

 

So long as any Series A Preferred Shares remain outstanding, the holders of
Series A Preferred Shares also will have the exclusive right to vote on any
amendment, alteration or repeal of the provisions of the Declaration,
including the terms of the Series A Preferred Shares on which holders of
Series A Preferred Shares are otherwise entitled to vote, pursuant to the
second sentence of the first paragraph of this Section 7(f) that would alter
only the contract rights, as expressly set forth in the Declaration, of the
Series A Preferred Shares, and the holders of any other classes or series of
beneficial interest of the Trust will not be entitled to vote on such an
amendment, alteration or repeal. With respect to any amendment, alteration or
repeal of the provisions of the Declaration, including the terms of the Series
A Preferred Shares, that equally affects the terms of the Series A Preferred
Shares and one or more other classes or series of Parity Preferred, so long as
any Series A Preferred Shares remain outstanding, the holders of Series A
Preferred Shares and of each other class or series of Parity
Preferred (voting together as a single class), also will have the exclusive
right to vote on any amendment, alteration or repeal of the provisions of the
Declaration, including the terms of the Series A Preferred Shares on which
holders of Series A Preferred Shares are otherwise entitled to vote, pursuant
to the second sentence of the first paragraph of this Section 7(f) that would
alter only the contract rights, as expressly set forth in the Declaration, of
the Series A Preferred Shares and such other classes or series of Parity
Preferred, and the holders of any other classes or series of beneficial
interest of the Trust will not be entitled to vote on such an amendment,
alteration or repeal.

 

Holders of Series A Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to vote with
respect to (A) any issuance or increase in the total number of authorized
Common Shares or Preferred Shares, or (B) any issuance or increase in the
number of authorized Series A Preferred Shares or the creation or issuance of
shares of any other class or series of beneficial interest, or (C)
any increase in the number of authorized shares of any other class or series
of beneficial interest, in each case referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C)
above ranking on parity with or junior to the Series A Preferred Shares with
respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Trust. Except as set forth
herein, holders of the Series A Preferred Shares shall not have any voting
rights with respect to, and the consent of the holders of the Series A
Preferred Shares shall not be required for, the taking of any trust action,
including an Event, regardless of the effect that such trust action or Event
may have upon the powers, preferences, voting power or other rights or
privileges of the Series A Preferred Shares.

(g) The foregoing voting provisions of this Section 7 shall not apply if, at
or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would
otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding Series A Preferred
Shares shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice
pursuant to these Articles Supplementary and sufficient funds, in cash, shall
have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.

(h) In any matter in which the Series A Preferred Shares may vote (as
expressly provided herein), each Series A Preferred Share shall be entitled to
one vote per $25.00 of liquidation preference.

 

Section 8\. _Conversion_. The Series A Preferred Shares are not convertible
into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the Trust,
except as provided in this Section 8\.

 



-9- (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of Series A
Preferred Shares shall have the right, unless, prior to the Change of Control
Conversion Date, the Trust has provided or provides notice of its election to
redeem the Series A Preferred Shares pursuant to the Redemption Right or
Special Optional Redemption Right, to convert some or all of the Series A
Preferred Shares held by such holder (the " _Change of Control Conversion
Right_ ") on the Change of Control Conversion Date into a number of Common
Shares, per Series A Preferred Share to be converted (the " _Common Share
Conversion Consideration_ ") equal to the lesser of (A) the quotient obtained
by dividing (i) the sum of (x) the $25.00 liquidation preference per Series A
Preferred Share to be converted plus (y) the amount of any accrued and unpaid
dividends to, but not including, the Change of Control Conversion Date (unless
the Change of Control Conversion Date is after a Dividend Record Date and
prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, in which case no additional
amount for such accrued and unpaid dividends will be included in such sum) by
(ii) the Common Share Price (as defined herein) and (B) [ ] (the "
_Share Cap_ "), subject to the immediately succeeding paragraph.

 

The Share Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any share splits
(including those effected pursuant to a distribution of the Common Shares),
subdivisions or combinations (in each case, a " _Share Split_ ") with respect
to the Common Shares as follows: the adjusted Share Cap as the result of a
Share Split shall be the number of Common Shares that is equivalent to
the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Share Cap in effect immediately
prior to such Share Split by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of Common Shares outstanding after giving effect to such Share Split
and the denominator of which is the number of Common Shares outstanding
immediately prior to such Share Split.

In the case of a Change of Control pursuant to which Common Shares shall be
converted into cash, securities or other property or assets (including any
combination thereof) (the " _Alternative Form Consideration_"), a holder of
Series A Preferred Shares shall receive upon conversion of such Series A
Preferred Shares the kind and amount of Alternative Form Consideration which
such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive upon the Change of
Control had such holder held a number of Common Shares equal to the Common
Share Conversion Consideration immediately prior to the effective time of the
Change of Control (the " _Alternative Conversion Consideration_ "; and the
Common Share Conversion Consideration or the Alternative Conversion
Consideration, as may be applicable to a Change of Control, shall be referred
to herein as the " _Conversion Consideration_ ").

 

In the event that holders of Common Shares have the opportunity to elect the
form of consideration to be received in the Change of Control, the Conversion
Consideration will be deemed to be the kind and amount of consideration
actually received by holders of a majority of the Common Shares that voted for
such an election (if electing between two types of consideration) or holders
of a plurality of the Common Shares that voted for such an election (if
electing between more than two types of consideration), as the case may be,
and will be subject to any limitations to which all holders of Common Shares
are subject, including, without limitation, pro rata reductions applicable to
any portion of the consideration payable in the Change of Control.

The " _Change of Control Conversion Date_ " shall be a Business Day set forth
in the notice of Change of Control provided in accordance with Section 8(c)
below that is no less than 20 days nor more than 35 days after the date
on which the Trust provides such notice pursuant to Section 8(c).

The " _Common Share Price_ " shall be (i) if the consideration to be received
in the Change of Control by the holders of Common Shares is solely cash, the
amount of cash consideration per Common Share or (ii) if the consideration to
be received in the Change of Control by holders of Common Shares is other
than solely cash (x) the average of the closing sale prices per Common Share
(or, if no closing sale price is reported, the average of the closing bid and
ask prices or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average
closing bid and the average closing ask prices) for the ten consecutive
trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the effective date of
the Change of Control as reported on the principal U.S. securities exchange on
which the Common Shares are then traded, or (y) the average of the last
quoted bid prices for the Common Shares in the over-the-counter market as
reported by OTC Markets Group, Inc. or similar organization for the ten
consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the
effective date of the Change of Control, if the Common Shares are not then
listed for trading on a U.S. securities exchange.

 

(b) No fractional Common Shares shall be issued upon the conversion of Series
A Preferred Shares. In lieu of fractional Common Shares, holders shall be
entitled to receive the cash value of such fractional Common Shares based on
the Common Share Price.

 



-10- (c) Within 15 days following the occurrence of a Change of Control, a notice
of occurrence of the Change of Control, describing the resulting Change of
Control Conversion Right, shall be delivered to the holders of record of the
Series A Preferred Shares at their addresses as they appear on the Trusts
share transfer records and notice shall be provided to the Trusts transfer
agent. No failure to give such notice or any defect thereto or in the mailing
thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the conversion of any
Series A Preferred Shares except as to the holder to whom notice was
defective or not given. Each notice shall state: (i) the events constituting
the Change of Control; (ii) the date of the Change of Control; (iii) the last
date on which the holders of Series A Preferred Shares may exercise their
Change of Control Conversion Right; (iv) the method and period for calculating
the Common Share Price; (v) the Change of Control Conversion Date, which shall
be a Business Day occurring within 20 to 35 days following the date of such
notice; (vi) that if, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, the
Trust has provided or provides notice of its election to redeem all or any
portion of the Series A Preferred Shares, the holder will not be able to
convert Series A Preferred Shares designated for redemption and such Series A
Preferred Shares shall be redeemed on the related redemption date, even if
they have already been tendered for conversion pursuant to the Change of
Control Conversion Right; (vii) if applicable, the type and amount of
Alternative Conversion Consideration entitled to be received per Series A
Preferred Share; (viii) the name and address of the paying agent and the
conversion agent; and (ix) the procedures that the holders of Series A
Preferred Shares must follow to exercise the Change of Control Conversion
Right.

 

(d) The Trust shall issue a press release for publication on the Dow Jones and
Corporation, Inc., Business Wire, PR Newswire or Bloomberg Business News (or,
if such organizations are not in existence at the time of issuance of such
press release, such other news or press organization as is reasonably
calculated to broadly disseminate the relevant information to the public), or
post notice on the Trusts website, in any event prior to the opening of
business on the first Business Day following any date on which the Trust
provides notice pursuant to Section 8(c) above to the holders of Series
A Preferred Shares.

(e) In order to exercise the Change of Control Conversion Right, a holder of
Series A Preferred Shares shall be required to deliver, on or before the
close of business on the Change of Control Conversion Date, the certificates
(if any) evidencing the Series A Preferred Shares to be converted, duly
endorsed for transfer, together with a written conversion notice completed,
to the Trusts transfer agent. Such notice shall state: (i) the relevant
Change of Control Conversion Date; (ii) the number of Series A Preferred
Shares to be converted; and (iii) that the Series A Preferred Shares are to
be converted pursuant to the applicable provisions of these Articles
Supplementary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Series A Preferred Shares
are held in global form, such notice shall comply with applicable procedures
of The Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ").

(f) Holders of Series A Preferred Shares may withdraw any notice of exercise
of a Change of Control Conversion Right (in whole or in part) by a written
notice of withdrawal delivered to the Trusts transfer agent prior to the
close of business on the Business Day prior to the Change of Control
Conversion Date. The notice of withdrawal must state: (i) the number of
withdrawn Series A Preferred Shares; (ii) if certificated shares of Series A
Preferred Stock have been issued, the certificate numbers of the withdrawn
Series A Preferred Shares; and (iii) the number of Series A Preferred Shares,
if any, which remain subject to the conversion notice. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Series A Preferred Shares are held in global form, the
notice of withdrawal shall comply with applicable procedures of DTC.

(g) Series A Preferred Shares as to which the Change of Control Conversion
Right has been properly exercised and for which the conversion notice has not
been properly withdrawn shall be converted into the applicable Conversion
Consideration in accordance with the Change of Control Conversion Right on the
Change of Control Conversion Date, unless, prior to the Change of Control
Conversion Date, the Trust has provided or provides notice of its election to
redeem such Series A Preferred Shares, whether pursuant to its Redemption
Right or Special Optional Redemption Right. If the Trust elects to redeem
Series A Preferred Shares that would otherwise be converted into the
applicable Conversion Consideration on a Change of Control Conversion Date,
such Series A Preferred Shares shall not be so converted and the holders of
such shares of beneficial interest shall be entitled to receive on the
applicable redemption date $25.00 per Series A Preferred Share, plus any
accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to, but not including, the redemption
date.

 

(h) The Trust shall deliver the applicable Conversion Consideration no later
than the third Business Day following the Change of Control Conversion Date.

 



-11- (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no holder of
Series A Preferred Shares will be entitled to convert such Series A Preferred
Shares into Common Shares to the extent that receipt of such Common Shares
would cause the holder of such Common Shares (or any other person) to have
actual ownership, Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership in excess of
the Preferred Share Ownership Limit, or such other limit as permitted by the
Board of Trustees pursuant to Article VII of the Declaration.

 

Section 9\. _Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer; Legend_. The Series A
Preferred Shares shall be subject to the restrictions on ownership and
transfer set forth in Article VII of the Declaration. Each certificate for
Series A Preferred Shares shall bear substantially the following legend:

 

THE TRUST WILL FURNISH TO ANY SHAREHOLDER ON REQUEST AND WITHOUT CHARGE A FULL
STATEMENT OF THE DESIGNATIONS AND ANY PREFERENCES, CONVERSION AND OTHER
RIGHTS, VOTING POWERS, RESTRICTIONS, LIMITATIONS AS TO DIVIDENDS,
QUALIFICATIONS, AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF REDEMPTION OF THE SHARES OF EACH
CLASS WHICH THE TRUST IS AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE, OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THE
RELATIVE RIGHTS AND PREFERENCES BETWEEN THE SHARES OF EACH SERIES OF A
PREFERRED OR SPECIAL CLASS IN SERIES WHICH THE TRUST IS AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE,
TO THE EXTENT THEY HAVE BEEN SET, AND OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD OF
TRUSTEES TO SET THE RELATIVE RIGHTS AND PREFERENCES OF SUBSEQUENT SERIES OF A
PREFERRED OR SPECIAL CLASS OF SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST. SUCH REQUEST MAY
BE MADE TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TRUST OR TO ITS TRANSFER AGENT. THE SECURITIES
REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON OWNERSHIP AND
TRANSFER FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE TRUSTS MAINTENANCE OF ITS STATUS AS A REAL
ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (A "REIT") UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS
AMENDED (THE "CODE"). EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THE
DECLARATION OF TRUST, (i) NO PERSON MAY BENEFICIALLY OR CONSTRUCTIVELY OWN
COMMON SHARES IN EXCESS OF 9.8% (IN VALUE OR NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES) OF THE
OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES UNLESS SUCH PERSON IS AN EXCEPTED HOLDER (IN WHICH
CASE THE EXCEPTED HOLDER LIMIT SHALL BE APPLICABLE); (ii) NO PERSON MAY
BENEFICIALLY OR CONSTRUCTIVELY OWN PREFERRED SHARES IN EXCESS OF 9.8% (IN
VALUE OR NUMBER OF PREFERRED SHARES) OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF ANY CLASS
OR SERIES OF PREFERRED SHARES UNLESS SUCH PERSON IS AN EXCEPTED HOLDER (IN
WHICH CASE THE EXCEPTED HOLDER LIMIT SHALL BE APPLICABLE); (iii) NO PERSON MAY
BENEFICIALLY OR CONSTRUCTIVELY OWN SHARES THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE TRUST
BEING "CLOSELY HELD" UNDER SECTION 856(H) OF THE CODE OR OTHERWISE CAUSE THE
TRUST TO FAIL TO QUALIFY AS A REIT; AND (iv) ANY TRANSFER OF SHARES THAT, IF
EFFECTIVE, WOULD RESULT IN SHARES BEING BENEFICIALLY OWNED BY FEWER THAN 100
PERSONS (AS DETERMINED UNDER THE PRINCIPLES OF SECTION 856(A)(5) OF THE CODE)
SHALL BE VOID AB INITIO, AND THE INTENDED TRANSFEREE SHALL ACQUIRE NO RIGHTS
IN SUCH SHARES. ANY PERSON WHO BENEFICIALLY OR CONSTRUCTIVELY OWNS OR ATTEMPTS
TO BENEFICIALLY OR CONSTRUCTIVELY OWN SHARES WHICH CAUSE OR WILL CAUSE A
PERSON TO BENEFICIALLY OR CONSTRUCTIVELY OWN SHARES IN EXCESS OR IN VIOLATION
OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MUST IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THE TRUST IN WRITING (OR, IN
THE CASE OF AN ATTEMPTED TRANSACTION, GIVE AT LEAST 15 DAYS PRIOR WRITTEN
NOTICE) AND SHALL PROVIDE TO THE TRUST SUCH OTHER INFORMATION AS IT MAY
REQUEST IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF ANY SUCH TRANSFER ON THE TRUSTS
STATUS AS A REIT. IF ANY OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OR OWNERSHIP AS SET
FORTH IN (i), (ii) OR (iii) ABOVE ARE VIOLATED, THE EXCESS SHARES WILL BE
AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED TO A CHARITABLE TRUST FOR THE BENEFIT OF ONE OR MORE
CHARITABLE BENEFICIARIES. IN ADDITION, THE TRUST MAY REDEEM SHARES UPON THE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS SPECIFIED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION
IF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES DETERMINES THAT OWNERSHIP OR A TRANSFER OR OTHER
EVENT MAY VIOLATE THE RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE. FURTHERMORE, UPON THE
OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS, ATTEMPTED TRANSFERS IN VIOLATION OF THE
RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED IN (i), (ii) OR (iii) ABOVE MAY BE VOID AB INITIO. ALL
CAPITALIZED TERMS IN THIS LEGEND HAVE THE MEANINGS DEFINED IN THE DECLARATION
OF TRUST, A COPY OF WHICH, INCLUDING THE RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AND
OWNERSHIP, WILL BE FURNISHED TO EACH HOLDER OF SHARES ON REQUEST AND WITHOUT
CHARGE.
