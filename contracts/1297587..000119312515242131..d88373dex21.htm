(AS DETERMINED UNDER THE PRINCIPLES OF SECTION 856(A)(5) OF THE CODE) SHALL BE VOID AB INITIO, AND THE INTENDED TRANSFEREE SHALL ACQUIRE NO RIGHTS IN SUCH SHARES. ANY PERSON WHO BENEFICIALLY OR CONSTRUCTIVELY OWNS OR ATTEMPTS TO BENEFICIALLY OR
CONSTRUCTIVELY OWN SHARES WHICH CAUSE OR WILL CAUSE A PERSON TO BENEFICIALLY OR CONSTRUCTIVELY OWN SHARES IN EXCESS OR IN VIOLATION OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MUST IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THE TRUST IN WRITING (OR, IN THE CASE OF AN ATTEMPTED TRANSACTION,
GIVE AT LEAST 15 DAYS PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE) AND SHALL PROVIDE TO THE TRUST SUCH OTHER INFORMATION AS IT MAY REQUEST IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF ANY SUCH TRANSFER ON THE TRUST&#146;S STATUS AS A REIT. IF ANY OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OR
OWNERSHIP AS SET FORTH IN (i), (ii)&nbsp;OR (iii)&nbsp;ABOVE ARE VIOLATED, THE EXCESS SHARES WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED TO A CHARITABLE TRUST FOR THE BENEFIT OF ONE OR MORE CHARITABLE BENEFICIARIES. IN ADDITION, THE TRUST MAY REDEEM SHARES
UPON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SPECIFIED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION IF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES DETERMINES THAT OWNERSHIP OR A TRANSFER OR OTHER EVENT MAY VIOLATE THE RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE. FURTHERMORE, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF
CERTAIN EVENTS, ATTEMPTED TRANSFERS IN VIOLATION OF THE RESTRICTIONS DESCRIBED IN (i), (ii)&nbsp;OR (iii)&nbsp;ABOVE MAY BE VOID AB INITIO. ALL CAPITALIZED TERMS IN THIS LEGEND HAVE THE MEANINGS DEFINED IN THE DECLARATION OF TRUST, A COPY OF WHICH,
INCLUDING THE RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AND OWNERSHIP, WILL BE FURNISHED TO EACH HOLDER OF SHARES ON REQUEST AND WITHOUT CHARGE. </P>
