AGREEMENT

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

Section 1\. THE OFFER

1.1. Conduct of the Offer.

(a) Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to, and Acquisition Sub shall, use
commercially reasonable efforts to commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act) the Offer as promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement and to the extent feasible and with the reasonable cooperation
of the Company and the Companys Representatives, within five (5) business
days after the date of this Agreement. Each share of Company Common Stock
accepted by Acquisition Sub in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer shall be exchanged for the right to receive $35.00,
net to the holder of such share in cash (the " _Per Share Consideration_ ").
The date on which Acquisition Sub commences the Offer, within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Offer Commencement Date_."



 

1 (b) The obligation of Acquisition Sub to accept for tender (and the obligation
of Parent to cause Acquisition Sub to accept for tender) shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer shall
be subject to (i) the condition (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") that there shall
be validly tendered (and not withdrawn) a number of shares of Company Common
Stock that, together with any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any other Subsidiaries of Parent immediately prior to the
acceptance for tender of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer, represents more than 50% of the Adjusted Outstanding Share Number (as
defined below) and (ii) the other conditions set forth in _Exhibit B_. The
Minimum Condition and the other conditions set forth in _Exhibit B_ are
referred to collectively as the " _Offer Conditions_." For purposes of this
Agreement, the " _Adjusted Outstanding Share Number_ " shall be the sum of (1)
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, _plus_ (2) at the election of
Parent, an additional number of shares up to (but not exceeding) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all
Company Options, Company Warrants and other rights to acquire Company Common
Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the acceptance of shares of
Company Common Stock for tender pursuant to the Offer and that are vested and
exercisable or will be vested and exercisable prior to the Effective Time (but
in all cases excluding the shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Top-
Up Option).

(c) Acquisition Sub expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
(i) increase the Per Share Consideration and (ii) waive or make any other
changes to the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided, however_ , that
without the prior written consent of the Company: (A) the Minimum Condition
may not be amended or waived; and (B) no change may be made to the Offer that
(1) changes the form of consideration to be delivered by Acquisition Sub
pursuant to the Offer, (2) decreases the Per Share Consideration, (3)
decreases the number of shares of Company Common Stock to be purchased by
Acquisition Sub in the Offer, (4) modifies the Offer or the Offer Conditions
in a manner adverse to the stockholders of the Company or imposes conditions
to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, or (5) except as provided
in _Section 1.1(d)_, extends the expiration time of the Offer beyond the
initial expiration time of the Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of
the Offer and this Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Acquisition Sub to, (x) accept for tender all shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer as soon as
practicable after Acquisition Sub is permitted to do so under applicable Legal
Requirements (and in any event in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) of the
Exchange Act) and (y) deliver the Per Share Consideration in payment for each
share of Company Common Stock accepted for tender pursuant to the Offer.

(d) The Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire 20 business days
following the Offer Commencement Date (calculated as set forth in Rule
14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the
parties respective termination rights under _Section 8.1_: (i) if, at the
time as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, any Offer Condition is not
satisfied and has not been waived, then, subject to the parties respective
termination rights under _Section 8.1_, Acquisition Sub shall extend
the Offer on one or more occasions, for additional successive periods of up
to 20 business days per extension (with the length of such periods to be
determined by Parent), until all Offer Conditions are satisfied or validly
waived in order to permit the Acceptance Time to occur; _provided, however_ ,
that in no event shall Acquisition Sub be required to extend the Offer to a
date later than the Termination Date (as defined in Section 8.1(c)); and (ii)
Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer from time to time for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the
staff of the SEC applicable to the Offer. If less than 90% of the number of
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are accepted for tender pursuant
to the Offer, Acquisition Sub may, in its sole discretion (and without the
consent of the Company or any other Person), elect to provide for one or more
subsequent offering periods (of up to 20 business days in the aggregate)
in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall promptly accept for
payment, and deliver consideration for, all shares of Company Common Stock
that are validly tendered during any such subsequent offering period (or any
extension thereof). For the avoidance of doubt, if, at any scheduled
expiration date of the Offer, all of the Offer Conditions have been satisfied
or waived in writing by Parent, and this Agreement has not otherwise been
terminated in accordance with its terms, Acquisition Sub shall promptly accept
for payment, and deliver consideration for, all shares of Company 



 

2  Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer in accordance with this Agreement. For the further avoidance of doubt,
the Acceptance Time shall not be extended by any subsequent offering periods.

(e) [Intentionally deleted].

(f) On the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall: (i)
cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer and forms of the related letter of transmittal and
summary advertisement (such Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO and all
exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto being referred to collectively
in this Agreement as the " _Offer Documents_ "); and (ii) cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock to
the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements (including the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder). Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall cause the Offer Documents to comply in all material respects with
applicable Legal Requirements (including the Exchange Act and the Securities
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder). The Company and its counsel
shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents (including all amendments and supplements thereto) prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC, and Parent and Acquisition Sub shall include all
additions, deletions or changes thereto suggested by the Company and its legal
counsel that Parent determines, in its good faith discretion, to be
appropriate. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly provide the Company
and its counsel with a copy of any written comments and a description of any
oral comments received by Parent, Acquisition Sub or their counsel from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents. Each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall use reasonable efforts to respond promptly to any
comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the
Offer. To the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements (including the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder), (1) each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall correct
promptly any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents to the
extent that it becomes aware that such information shall be or shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect and (2) Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall take all steps necessary to promptly cause the Offer
Documents, as supplemented or amended to correct such information, to be filed
with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Acquisition Sub all
information concerning the Company and the Companys stockholders that may be
required or reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated
by this _Section 1.1(f)_.

(g) Between the date of this Agreement and the date on which any particular
share of Company Common Stock is accepted for tender pursuant to the Offer, if
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Per Share Consideration shall be adjusted to the extent necessary or
appropriate to achieve the same economic outcome.

1.2. Company Actions.

(a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents and warrants to
Parent and Acquisition Sub that the Companys board of directors, at a
meeting duly called and held on December 7, 2009, has by the unanimous vote of
all directors of the Company (i) determined that this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to
and in the best interests of the Companys stockholders, (ii) adopted and
approved this Agreement and approved the Offer, the Merger and the other
Contemplated Transactions, in accordance with the requirements of the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), (iii) declared that this
Agreement is advisable, (iv) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of
the Company accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer and (to the extent necessary) adopt this
Agreement, and (v) to the extent necessary, adopted a resolution having the
effect of causing the Company not to be subject to any restriction set forth
in any state takeover law or similar Legal Requirement that would otherwise
apply to the Stockholder Agreements, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Contemplated Transactions.



 

3 (b) Contemporaneously with the filing of the Schedule TO or as promptly
as practicable thereafter on the Offer Commencement Date, the Company shall
file with the SEC and (following or contemporaneously with the dissemination
of the Offer Documents and related documents) disseminate to holders of shares
of Company Common Stock a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule
14D-9_") that, subject to _Section 5.3_, shall reflect the Company
Board Recommendation. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties hereto
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
disseminated concurrently with and in the same mailing envelope as the Offer
Documents. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 and the filing and
dissemination thereof to comply in all material respects with applicable Legal
Requirements (including the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder). Parent and its legal counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including any
amendment or supplement thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and
the Company shall include all additions, deletions or changes thereto
suggested by Parent and its legal counsel that the Company determines, in its
good faith discretion, to be appropriate. The Company shall promptly provide
Parent and its legal counsel with a copy of any written comments and a
description of any oral comments received by the Company or its legal counsel
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to respond promptly to any such comments. To
the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements (including the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder), (i) each of Parent, Acquisition
Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for
use in the Schedule 14D-9 to the extent that it becomes aware that such
information shall be or shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and (ii) the Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9, as supplemented or amended to correct such information, to be
filed with the SEC and, if required by applicable Legal Requirements, to be
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock.

(c) The Company shall promptly provide to Parent (i) a list of the Companys
stockholders as well as mailing labels and any available listing or computer
file containing the names and addresses of all record holders of shares of
Company Common Stock and lists of securities positions of shares of Company
Common Stock held in stock depositories, in each case accurate and complete as
of the most recent practicable date, and (ii) such additional information
(including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of
securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably
request in connection with the Offer or the Merger. Except as may be required
by applicable Legal Requirements, and except as may be necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall hold in
confidence, in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and
this Agreement, any information contained in any such labels, listings and
files provided by the Company to Parent.

1.3. Directors. 

(a) Effective upon the Acceptance Time and from time to time thereafter,
Parent shall be entitled to designate, to serve on the Companys board of
directors, the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number,
determined by multiplying: (i) the total number of directors on the Companys
board of directors (giving effect to any increase in the size of the
Companys board of directors effected pursuant to this _Section 1.3(a)_);
_by_ (ii) a fraction having (x) a numerator equal to the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock then beneficially owned by Parent or
Acquisition Sub or any other Subsidiaries of Parent (including all shares of
Company Common Stock accepted for tender pursuant to the Offer) and (y) a
denominator equal to the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then
issued and outstanding. Promptly following a written request from Parent, the
Company shall take all actions necessary and reasonably available to the
Company to cause Parents designees (the " _Parent Designees_ ") to
be elected or appointed to the Companys board of directors, including
seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors and, if such
resignations are not obtained, increasing the size of the Companys board of
directors. From and after the Acceptance Time, to the extent requested by
Parent, the Company shall also, as permitted by all applicable Legal
Requirements (including the rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market), cause the
Parent Designees to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the next
whole number, on (1) each committee of the Companys board of directors and
(2) the board of 



 

4  directors of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee thereof)
that represents at least the same percentage as individuals designated by
Parent represent on the board of directors of the Company. In furtherance of
the foregoing, Parent shall designate an adequate number of Parent Designees
so that the audit committee of the Company has at least three (3) members, and
each of the Parent Designees serving on such audit committee shall be an
"independent director" as defined by Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Marketplace
Rules and eligible to serve on the Companys audit committee under the
Exchange Act and Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, and at least one (1) of whom shall
be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of
Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto. Notwithstanding the provisions of
this _Section 1.3_, at all times prior to the Effective Time (as defined in
_Section 2.3_ ), at least two (2) of the members of the Companys board of
directors shall be individuals who were directors of the Company on the date
of this Agreement (" _Continuing Directors_ "); _provided, however_ , that if
at any time prior to the Effective Time there shall be only one Continuing
Director serving as a director of the Company for any reason, then the
Companys board of directors shall, subject to the following sentence, cause
an individual selected by the remaining Continuing Director to be appointed to
serve on the Companys board of directors (and such individual shall be deemed
to be a Continuing Director for all purposes under this Agreement). The
Company shall designate, prior to the Acceptance Time, two (2) alternate
Continuing Directors that the board of directors of the Company shall appoint
in the event of death, disability or resignation of the Continuing Directors,
each of whom shall, following such appointment to the Companys board of
directors, be deemed to be a Continuing Director of the Company.

(b) In connection with the performance of its obligations to cause the Parent
Designees to be elected or appointed to the Companys board of directors, each
of the Company and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly take all actions, and the Company shall cause to be included in the
Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers
and directors, as Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder
require (subject to the Companys receipt of the information with respect to
Parent and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder). Parent shall
supply to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information
with respect to itself and its nominees (including the Parent Designees),
officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1,
and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such
information to enable it to be filed with the SEC in the Schedule 14D-9 on the
date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC. The provisions of this
_Section 1.3_ are in addition to, and shall not limit, any right that
Acquisition Sub, Parent or any affiliate of Acquisition Sub or Parent may have
(with respect to the election of directors or otherwise) under
applicable Legal Requirements as a holder or beneficial owner of shares of
Company Common Stock.

(c) Following the election or appointment of the Parent Designees to the
Companys board of directors pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_ and until the
Effective Time, each of the following actions may be effected only if there
are on the Companys board of directors one or more Continuing Directors and
such action is approved by a majority of such Continuing Directors: (i) action
by the Company with respect to any amendment or waiver of any term or
condition of this Agreement, the Merger, or the certificate of incorporation
or bylaws of the Company; (ii) termination of this Agreement by the Company;
(iii) extension by the Company of the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of Parent or Acquisition Sub, or any waiver or
assertion of any of the Companys rights under this Agreement; or (iv) other
consent or action by the Company with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any
of the other Contemplated Transactions; _provided_ that, in each case,
the taking of such action could reasonably be expected to affect adversely
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or
Acquisition Sub). To the extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements,
until the Effective Time, (x) the approval of any of the foregoing actions by
a majority of the Continuing Directors shall constitute the valid
authorization of the Companys board of directors with respect to such action
( _provided_ that all other requirements under the Companys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws and under applicable Legal Requirements are
satisfied) and (y) in addition to any requirements under the Companys
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, any quorum of the Companys board of
directors for the purposes of any meeting thereof or transacting of business
thereby with respect to the approval of any of the foregoing actions shall be
deemed to require the attendance of at least one (1) Continuing Director.



 

5 1.4. Top-Up Option.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Acquisition Sub an assignable and
irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, to purchase from the
Company an aggregate number of newly-issued shares of Company Common Stock
equal to the lesser of (i) the Top-Up Number (as defined below) or (ii) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that the Company is
authorized to issue under its certificate of incorporation but that are not
issued and outstanding (and are not subscribed for or otherwise committed to
be issued) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option. " _Top-Up Number_ "
means the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned of record by Parent or
Acquisition Sub or any other Subsidiaries of Parent at the time of exercise of
the Top-Up Option, constitutes a designated percentage of the number of shares
of Company Common Stock that would be outstanding immediately after the
issuance of all shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option,
which percentage shall be designated by Parent at its sole discretion,
_provided_ that such percentage shall be greater than 90% but less than 91%.

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Parent or Acquisition Sub, in whole
or in part, at any time at or after the Acceptance Time but prior to the
earlier of the Effective Time and the date on which this Agreement is
terminated. The aggregate purchase price payable for the shares of Company
Common Stock being purchased by Parent or Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Top-
Up Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of such shares _by_
the Per Share Consideration. Such purchase price may be paid by Parent or
Acquisition Sub, at its election, either entirely in cash or by executing and
delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal
to such purchase price, or by any combination of the foregoing. Any such
promissory note shall bear interest at the rate of 3% per annum, shall mature
on the first anniversary of the date of execution thereof and may be prepaid
without premium or penalty.

(c) In the event Parent or Acquisition Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up
Option, Parent or Acquisition Sub shall deliver to the Company a notice
setting forth (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that Parent or
Acquisition Sub intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the
manner in which Parent or Acquisition Sub intends to pay the applicable
exercise price and (iii) the place, date and time at which the closing of the
purchase of such shares of Company Common Stock by Parent or Acquisition Sub
is to take place, which date shall not be more than ten (10) business days
after the date of such notice. At the closing of the purchase of such shares
of Company Common Stock, Parent or Acquisition Sub shall cause to be delivered
to the Company the consideration required to be delivered in payment of such
shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Parent or Acquisition Sub
(as the case may be) a certificate representing such shares or, at Parent or
Acquisition Subs request or otherwise if the Company does not then have
certificated shares, the applicable number of uncertificated shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ").

(d) Acquisition Sub acknowledges that the shares of Company Common Stock that
Acquisition Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering.
Acquisition Sub represents and warrants to the Company that Acquisition Sub
is, and will be upon the purchase of shares subject to the Top-Up Option, an
"accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. Acquisition Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the shares
to be acquired upon exercise thereof are being and will be acquired by
Acquisition Sub for its own account, for the purpose of investment and not
with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof
(within the meaning of the Securities Act).

Section 2\. THE MERGER

2.1. Merger of Acquisition Sub into the Company. At the Effective Time (as
defined in _Section 2.3_), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set

shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "),
and the separate corporate existence of Acquisition Sub shall cease.



 

6 2.2. Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in

Acquisition Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company and Acquisition Sub shall

Corporation.

2.3. Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_
") shall take place at the offices of Ropes and Gray LLP, One International
Place, Boston, Massachusetts, at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be designated by
Parent, which shall be no later than the second (2nd) business day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7_, or at such other place or at such other
time or on such other date as Parent and the Company mutually agree in
writing. The day on which the Closing takes place is referred to as the "
_Closing Date_." Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
causing a certificate of merger complying with Section 251 or a
certificate of ownership and merger complying with Section 253, as
applicable, of the DGCL (either, the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the Closing Date. The
Merger shall become effective upon the date and time of the filing of such
Certificate of Merger, or at such later time as may be mutually agreed in
writing by the Company and Parent and specified in such Certificate of Merger
(the " _Effective Time_ "). 

2.4. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:

(a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be

2.5. Conversion of Shares.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any holder of
shares of the Company:

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by the Company or any wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company or held in the Companys treasury shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor;

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock then owned of record by Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor;

(iii) except as provided in  _clauses_ " _(i)_ " and " _(ii)_ " above and
subject to _Sections 2.5(b)_, _2.5(c)_ and _2.7_ , each share of Company
Common Stock then outstanding shall be converted into the right to
receive (upon the proper surrender of the certificate representing such share
or, in the case of a Book-Entry Share, the proper surrender of such Book-Entry
Share) the Per Share Consideration; and

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Acquisition
Sub then outstanding shall be converted into one newly and validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.



 

7 (b) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, if the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Per Share Consideration shall be adjusted to the extent necessary or
appropriate to achieve the same economic outcome.

(c) If (i) any share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time is unvested or is subject to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition under any restricted stock purchase agreement
or other agreement with the Company or under which the Company has any rights,
and (ii) such restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement does not
provide that the vesting of such share of Company Common Stock shall fully
accelerate at or prior to the Effective Time, then the amount payable with
respect thereto (or with respect to any portion that does not accelerate at or
prior to the Effective Time) pursuant to  _Section 2.5(a)(iii)_ will also be
unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or
other condition. The Company shall take all action that may be necessary to
ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to
exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in any such
restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement.

2.6. Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ").
Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent
cash in an amount equal to the cash payable pursuant to _Section
2.5(a)(iii)_, excluding amounts applicable to shares of Company Common Stock
with respect to which the holder thereof has perfected appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL. The cash amount so deposited with the Paying Agent,
together with any dividends or distributions received by the Paying Agent with
respect to such shares, are referred to collectively as the " _Exchange
Fund_." The cash in the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent
as directed by Parent in money market funds or similar short-term liquid
investments.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event no more than five (5)
business days after the Effective Time), Parent will instruct the Paying Agent
to promptly mail to the Persons who, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
were record holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock (" _Stock Certificates_ ") or uncertificated shares of Company Common
Stock represented by Book-Entry Shares, (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify (including, in the case of holders of Stock Certificates, a provision
confirming that delivery of Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such
Stock Certificates to the Paying Agent), and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Stock Certificates and Book-Entry Shares. Upon
surrender of a Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Paying Agent for
payment, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other
documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent or Parent, (A) the
holder of such Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to
receive in payment therefor the consideration deliverable to such holder
pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)(iii)_, and (B) the Stock Certificate or Book-
Entry Share so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.6(b)_, each Stock Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent
solely the right to receive the Per Share Consideration for each share of
Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Stock Certificate or Book-
Entry Share. If any Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition to the delivery of
any consideration with respect thereto, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and
to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Stock Certificate.

(c) [Intentionally deleted].

 



 

8 (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as of the date that is nine (9)
months after the date on which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered
to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Stock Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares who have not theretofore surrendered their Stock Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with this _Section 2.6_ shall thereafter look only
to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for delivery of consideration in
connection with the Merger. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to
any other Person with respect to any cash amounts delivered to any public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or
similar Legal Requirement.

(e) At the Effective Time, holders of Stock Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, and the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No
further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on
such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, a valid Stock Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be
exchanged as provided in this _Section 2.6_.

(f) Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Paying
Agent or the Surviving Corporation determines in good faith may be required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law or under any other Legal Requirement. To the extent
any such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(g) If any Stock Certificate has not been surrendered by the earlier of (i)
the fifth anniversary of the date on which the Merger becomes effective or
(ii) the date immediately prior to the date on which the consideration that
such Stock Certificate represents the right to receive would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Body, then such consideration
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

2.7. Appraisal Rights.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
share of Company Common Stock that, as of the Effective Time, is held by a
holder who is entitled to, and who has properly preserved, appraisal rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such share shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive the Per Share Consideration
in accordance with _Section 2.5(a)(iii)_, and the holder of such share shall
be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to such holder pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such share; _provided, however,_
that if such appraisal rights shall not be perfected or the holder of such
share shall otherwise lose such holders appraisal rights with respect to such
share, then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the time of the failure
to perfect such rights or the loss of such rights, such share shall
automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive
(upon the surrender of the Stock Certificate representing such share) the Per
Share Consideration in accordance with _ Section 2.5(a)(iii)_.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of (A) any written
demand received by the Company prior to the Effective Time to require the
Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL and (B) any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL, and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demand, notice or instrument. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior
to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand unless Parent shall have
consented in writing to such payment or settlement offer.

  

 

9 2.8. Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Acquisition
Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Acquisition Sub, in the
name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended June 24, 2009, and such assessment

required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial statements of
the Company. With respect to the financial statements (including any related
notes) contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents,

Company or the Companys independent auditors (whether current or former) in
the design or operation of internal controls of financial reporting utilized

for refund with respect to any Tax Return described in the first sentence of
_Section 3.16(j)_, compromise or settle any Legal Proceeding with respect to
any Tax or Tax-related matter, enter into or obtain any Tax ruling or take
any action that could reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse
impact on the Tax liability of the Company;

(xx) commence any Legal Proceeding, other than Legal Proceedings commenced for
the routine collection of bills;

(xxi) settle any claim or Legal Proceeding, other than claims or Legal
Proceedings against the Company that do not relate to Tax or Tax-related
matters and with respect to which the settlement involves solely the payment
by the Company of an amount less than $50,000 individually and less than
$250,000 in the aggregate for all such claims and Legal Proceedings settled
during the Pre-Closing Period;



 

31 (xxii) pay, discharge, settle or satisfy any claims (whether or not commenced
prior to the date of this Agreement), except that the Company may pay,
discharge, settle or satisfy any claim if the only obligation involved on the
part of the Company will be payment of money in an amount not to exceed
$50,000 individually and not to exceed $250,000 in the aggregate for all such
claims during the Pre-Closing Period; or

(xxiii) agree or commit to take any of the actions described in _clauses_ "
_(i)_ " through " _(xxii)_ " of this _Section 5.2(b)_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 5.2(a)_ or _5.2(b)_ to the contrary,
if (i) the Parent Designees constitute a majority of the directors sitting on
the board of directors of the Company and (ii) the board of directors of the
Company expressly directs or authorizes the Company (of its officers) to act
or not act in a certain manner, or expressly consents, in advance, to such
action or inaction, then such action or inaction shall be deemed not to
constitute a breach of _Section 5.2(a)_ or _5.2(b)_ ; _provided, however_ ,
that such direction, authorization or consent, as applicable, of the board of
directors of the Company shall be based on a resolution of the entire board of
directors (and not the approval of merely the majority of the Continuing
Directors, as contemplated by the  _Section 1.3(c)_).

(d) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall promptly notify Parent in
writing if the Company has the right to exercise any right or option to
repurchase shares of its capital stock from any Company Associate or other
Person upon termination of such Persons service. The Company shall not
exercise any such repurchase right except to the extent directed by Parent in
writing.

(e) By not later than immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall either (i) renegotiate all existing equipment leases that have change in
control provisions so that the lessor no longer has the right to either demand
accelerated rent or repossess the equipment by reason of the consummation of
the Offer or the Merger, or (ii) if the Company shall have been unable to
renegotiate all such leases in the manner described above, exercise its buyout
option with respect to all of such leases that have not been renegotiated,
with the result that the Company shall obtain fee ownership in all such
equipment and the lessors rights with respect to such equipment shall be
terminated. If the Company becomes obligated to exercise such buyout option,
but determines in good faith that it has inadequate funds to do so, then the
Company shall promptly notify Parent of the amount of funds so required and
provide Parent with reasonable documentary evidence supporting such
calculation, and Parent shall thereafter either (A) make such funds available
to the Company (which the Company shall use solely for the purpose of
exercising such buyout option), or (B) waive the Companys obligation to
exercise such buyout option.

(f) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, take any adverse action with respect to the Company that
(i) is inconsistent with actions previously taken by Parent or its
Subsidiaries in their existing commercial relationship with the Company prior
to the date of this Agreement or (ii) impairs, in any material respect,
the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company (it
being understood that during the Pre-Closing Period each of Parent and the
Company shall continue to operate their businesses with a view towards
maximizing the success of their individual businesses).

(g) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not take any adverse
action with respect to Parent that (i) is inconsistent with actions
previously taken by the Company in its existing commercial relationship with
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) impairs, in any material
respect, the business, financial condition or results of operations of Parent
(it being understood that during the Pre-Closing Period each of Parent and the
Company shall continue to operate their businesses with a view towards
maximizing the success of their individual businesses).

5.3. No Solicitation; Etc.

(a) Subject to _Sections 5.3(c)_ and _5.3(g)_ , during the Pre-Closing
Period, the Company shall not directly or indirectly, and shall not cause or
permit any Representatives of the Company to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, 



 

32  initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the making, submission
or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, (ii)
furnish any non-public information regarding the Company to any Person in
connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry, (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, (iv) approve,
endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of
intent or similar document or any Contract contemplating or providing for any
Acquisition Transaction or accepting any Acquisition Proposal; _provided,
however_ , that none of the foregoing restrictions shall apply to the
Companys and its Representatives interactions with Parent, Acquisition Sub
and their respective Representatives. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company acknowledges and agrees that any action taken by any
Representative of the Company that, if taken by the Company would constitute a
breach of this _Section 5.3_, shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this
_Section 5.3_ by the Company (whether or not such Representative is
purporting to act on behalf of the Company).

(b) [Intentionally deleted].

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its board of
directors from furnishing non-public information regarding the Company to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations (including, as a part thereof,
exchanging any counterproposals) with, any Person and its Representatives in
response to a written Acquisition Proposal that is submitted to the Company by
such Person (and not withdrawn) which the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor(s)) is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal if (i) neither the Company nor any Representative of the Company
shall have breached in any material respect any of the provisions set forth in
this _Section 5.3_, (ii) the board of directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach of the Companys board of directors fiduciary obligations to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements, (iii) prior to
furnishing any such non-public information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person, (A) the Company gives written notice to
Parent of the identity of such Person and of the Companys decision to furnish
non-public information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with,
such Person, and (B) the Company receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and
disclosure of all non-public written and oral information furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of the Company that are no less favorable to the
Company than the confidentiality provisions and use restrictions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, and (iv) contemporaneously with or prior to
furnishing any such non-public information to such Person, the Company Makes
Available to Parent all such non-public information (to the extent such non-
public information has not been previously Made Available to Parent).

(d) If the Company or any of its Representatives receives an Acquisition
Proposal or any request for non-public information at any time during the Pre-
Closing Period (other than from Parent, Acquisition Sub or their respective
Representatives), then the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than
24 hours after receipt of such Acquisition Proposal or request) advise Parent
in writing of such Acquisition Proposal or request (including the identity of
the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or request and the
material terms thereof) and provide Parent with a copy of such Acquisition
Proposal or request if it is in writing. The Company shall keep
Parent promptly informed with respect to any material development relating to
such Acquisition Proposal or request and any modification or proposed
modification thereto, and provide Parent with copies of such development,
modification and proposed modification if they are in writing.

(e) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing discussions between the Company or any of its Representatives and
any Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective
Representatives) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry pending as of the date of this Agreement.

(f) The Company agrees not to release any Person from, or to amend or waive
any provision of, any confidentiality, "standstill," nonsolicitation or
similar agreement to which the Company is or becomes a party or under which
the Company has or acquires any rights, and will use commercially reasonable
efforts to enforce or 



 

33  cause to be enforced each such agreement at the request of Parent;
_provided, however_ , that this _Section 5.3(f)_ shall not preclude the
Company from responding to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal submitted to
the Company by a party that is bound by a "standstill" agreement and shall not
require the Company to enforce or cause to be enforced its rights under such
"standstill" agreement relating to the submission of such unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal. The Company also shall promptly request each Person that
has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration
of a possible Acquisition Transaction to return or destroy in accordance with
the terms of such confidentiality agreement all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary:

(i) Subject to the Companys right to make a Recommendation Change (as defined
below) to the extent permitted by _Section 5.3(g)(ii)_ or _5.3(g)(iii)_ , the
Company (1) consents to the inclusion of the Company Board Recommendation in
the Offer Documents; and (2) agrees that the Company Board Recommendation
shall not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent or
Acquisition Sub, and that no resolution of the board of directors of the
Company or any committee thereof to withdraw or modify the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub shall be
adopted (it being understood that the Company Board Recommendation shall be
deemed to have been modified in a manner adverse to Parent and Acquisition Sub
if it shall no longer be unanimous) (any such withdrawal, modification or
adoption being referred to in this Agreement as a " _Recommendation Change_
").

(ii) A Recommendation Change may be made at any time prior to the Acceptance
Time if: (i) an Acquisition Proposal is made that did not result from a breach
by the Company of any of the provisions of _Section 5.3_ ; (ii) at least one
(1) day prior to the date of any meeting of the Companys board of directors
(or any committee thereof) at which such board of directors (or committee)
will consider whether such Acquisition Proposal may constitute a Superior
Proposal or whether such Acquisition Proposal may require the Company to make
a Recommendation Change, the Company provides Parent with a written notice
specifying the date and time of such meeting, the reasons for holding such
meeting and a description of such Acquisition Proposal; (iii) the Companys
board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel and its financial advisor(s), (A) that such
Acquisition Proposal would, if this Agreement or the Offer were not
amended or an alternative transaction with Parent were not entered into,
constitute a Superior Proposal and (B) that in light of such Acquisition
Proposal, the failure to make a Recommendation Change, if this Agreement or
the Offer were not amended or an alternative transaction with Parent were not
entered into, could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the
Companys board of directors fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (iv) the Company delivers
to Parent a Superior Proposal Notice in accordance with _Section 5.3(g)(iv)_
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal (including as an attachment the
Specified Definitive Acquisition Agreement (as defined in _Section
5.3(g)(iv)_) relating to such Acquisition Proposal) and otherwise complies in
all material respects with the notice, negotiation and other requirements set
forth in _Section 5.3(g)(iv)_ ; and (v) following the negotiation period(s)
described in _Section 5.3(g)(iv)_, the Companys board of directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor(s), and after taking into account any
definitive written proposal submitted to the Company by Parent or Acquisition
Sub to amend this Agreement or the Offer or to enter into an alternative
transaction as a result of any negotiations contemplated by  _Section
5.3(g)(iv)_, that (A) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, and (B) in light of such Acquisition Proposal, the failure to make a
Recommendation Change could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of
the Companys board of directors fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements.

(iii) A Recommendation Change may also be made at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time if: (i) there shall occur or arise after the date of this
Agreement a material and fundamental development or material and fundamental
change in circumstances that relates to the Company but does not relate to any
Acquisition Proposal (any such material development or material change in
circumstances unrelated to an 



 

34  Acquisition Proposal being referred to in this Agreement as an "
_Intervening Event_ "); (ii) neither the Company nor any Representative of the
Company had any Knowledge of such Intervening Event or, as of the date of
this Agreement, could reasonably foresee that such Intervening Event would
occur; (iii) at least one (1) day prior to the date of any meeting of the
Companys board of directors (or any committee thereof) at which such board
of directors (or committee) will consider whether such Intervening Event may
require a Recommendation Change, the Company provides Parent with a written
notice specifying the date and time of such meeting, the reasons for holding
such meeting and a description of such Intervening Event; (iv) the Companys
board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel and its financial advisor(s), that, in light
of such Intervening Event, the failure to make a Recommendation Change, if
this Agreement or the Offer were not amended or an alternative transaction
with Parent were not entered into, could reasonably be expected to constitute
a breach of the Companys board of directors fiduciary obligations to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (v) a
Recommendation Change is not made at any time within the period of four (4)
business days after Parent receives written notice from the Company
confirming that the Companys board of directors has determined that the
failure to make a Recommendation Change in light of such Intervening Event
could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements;
(vi) during such four (4) business day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this
Agreement or the Offer or enter into an alternative transaction so that the
failure to make a Recommendation Change in light of such Intervening Event
could not reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its
fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements; and (vii) at the end of such four (4) business day period, the
Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys outside legal counsel and its financial advisor(s), that the
failure to make a Recommendation Change could reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of the fiduciary obligations of the Companys board of
directors to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements
in light of such Intervening Event (taking into account any definitive written
proposal submitted to the Company by Parent or Acquisition Sub to amend this
Agreement or the Offer or enter into an alternative transaction as a result
of the negotiations contemplated by _clause_ " _(vi)_ " above).

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section
5.3(g)(ii)_, a Recommendation Change may not be made pursuant to _Section
5.3(g)(ii)_, and this Agreement may not be terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)_, unless: (i) the board of directors of the Company shall have received
an Acquisition Proposal that it has determined to be a Superior Proposal
pursuant to _Section 5.3(g)(ii)_ and shall have received from the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal a definitive acquisition agreement, duly
executed on behalf of such Person, providing for the consummation of the
transaction contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal, or other duly executed
summary of all of the terms of such Acquisition Proposal (in either case, the
" _Specified Definitive Acquisition Agreement_ "); (ii) not less than four (4)
business days (or such longer period as provided below) prior to any such
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 5.3(g)(ii)_ and not less than four
(4) business days (or such longer period as provided below) prior to any
termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to  _Section 8.1(e)_,
the Company shall have delivered to Parent a written notice (the " _Superior
Proposal Notice_ ") stating that the Company (or its board of directors)
intends to take such action pursuant to  _Section 5.3(g)(ii)_ and/or
_Section 8.1(e)_ and intends to enter into the Specified Definitive
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any determination to send to Parent, or actual
delivery to Parent of, a Superior Proposal Notice shall not, in and of itself,
constitute a Triggering Event); (iii) during the four (4) business day period
commencing on the date of Parents receipt of such Superior Proposal Notice
(as such period may be extended as provided below), the Company shall have
made its Representatives reasonably available for the purpose of engaging in
negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding
a possible amendment of this Agreement or the Offer or a possible alternative
transaction so that the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the
Superior Proposal Notice ceases to be a Superior Proposal; and (iv) any
definitive written proposal made by Parent or Acquisition Sub to amend this
Agreement or the Offer or enter into an alternative transaction during the
negotiations described in _clause_ " _(iii)_ " above shall have been
considered by the board of directors of the Company in good faith, and, after
the expiration of the negotiation period described in _clause_ " _(iii)_ "
above, the 



 

35  Companys board of directors shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor(s), that such Acquisition Proposal still constitutes a Superior
Proposal; _provided, however_ , that, in the event of any amendment to the
financial or other material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, the Company
shall be required to deliver to Parent a new Superior Proposal Notice
(including as attachments thereto a copy of the new Specified Definitive
Acquisition Agreement relating to such amended Acquisition Proposal), and the
negotiation period described in _clause_ " _(iii)_ " above shall be extended
by an additional two (2) business days from the date of Parents receipt of
such new Superior Proposal Notice, with respect to any such amendment.

(h) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its board of
directors from disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position with
respect to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A;
_provided, however_ , that unless such disclosure consists solely of a "stop,
look and listen" communication containing only statements contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, the Company shall first comply with
_Section 5.3(g)(iii)_ to the extent applicable to such disclosure and such
disclosure may, to the extent provided herein, constitute a Triggering Event.

Section 6\. ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

6.1. Stockholder Approval; Proxy Statement.

(a) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders is
required by applicable Legal Requirements in order to consummate the Merger,
the Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the later of the
Acceptance Time or the expiration of any subsequent offering period provided
in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, take all action
necessary or advisable under applicable Legal Requirements to call, give
notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock to vote on
the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_"). The
Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the
Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable
Legal Requirements.

(b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders is
required by applicable Legal Requirements in order to consummate the Merger,
as soon as practicable following the later of the Acceptance Time or
the expiration of any subsequent offering period provided in accordance with
Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, the Company shall prepare and file with
the SEC the Proxy Statement. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable efforts to (A) cause the Proxy Statement to comply in all material
respects with applicable Legal Requirements (including the Exchange Act and
the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder), (B) respond
promptly to any comments received from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Proxy Statement, and (C) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement. The Company (x) shall give Parent reasonable opportunity to
comment on any correspondence with the SEC or its staff regarding the Proxy
Statement or any proposed material to be included in the Proxy Statement prior
to its transmission to the SEC or its staff and (y) shall not transmit any
such material to which Parent reasonably objects. The Company shall respond
promptly to any comments received from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Proxy Statement, and shall correct promptly any information in the
Proxy Statement if and to the extent that it becomes aware that such
information shall be or shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting there shall
occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare such an amendment or
supplement and, after obtaining the consent of Parent to such amendment or
supplement, promptly transmit such amendment or supplement to the Companys
stockholders.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
Parent, Acquisition Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent shall own, by virtue
of the Offer or otherwise, in the aggregate at least 90% of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company
shall take all actions 



 

36  necessary and appropriate to cause the merger of Acquisition Sub into the
Company to become effective as soon as practicable following the time such
ownership is first obtained, without a stockholders meeting in accordance
with Section 253 of the DGCL.

(d) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders is
required by applicable Legal Requirements in order to consummate the Merger,
Parent agrees to cause all shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent to be present and voted in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

6.2. Company Options and Company Warrants.

(a) At the Acceptance Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, whether or not
vested, shall automatically (and without any action on the part of any party
hereto or the holder thereof) be cancelled and cease to represent a right to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock, and converted into the right (each, a
" _Right_ ") to receive the following:

(i) if the exercise price per share of such Company Option is less than the
Per Share Consideration, then an amount of cash determined by multiplying (1)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, _times_ (2) the amount by
which (x) the Per Share Consideration _exceeds_ (y) the exercise price per
share of such Company Option; and

(ii) if the exercise price per share of such Company Option is equal to or
greater than the Per Share Consideration, then no cash.

The vesting terms previously applicable to any Company Option that is so
cancelled and converted into a Right shall continue in full force and effect
and in all respects apply to such Right, and the cash payable in respect of
such Right, as set forth in _clauses_ " _(i)_ " and " _(ii)_ " above, shall be
delivered to the holder of such Right at such times and in the same
percentages as the cancelled Company Option would have become vested in
connection with or following the acquisition of shares by Acquisition Sub
pursuant to the Offer and/or consummation of the Merger. For the avoidance of
doubt, any vesting of a Company Option that occurs by reason of the
acquisition of shares by Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer and/or
consummation of the Merger (whether alone or in combination with any other
event) shall be given effect by its application to the Right into which such
Company Option shall be converted upon its cancellation. At the Acceptance
Time, Parents board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the
authority and responsibility of the Companys board of directors or any
committee thereof with respect to each such Company Option and corresponding
Right.

(b) Within ten (10) business days following the Acceptance Time, Parent shall
send to each former holder of a Company Option a written notice setting forth
the amount of cash subject to each Right in respect of a Company Option. 

(c) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take all action that may be necessary (under the
Company Equity Plans and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this
_Section 6.2_ and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders
of Company Options have no rights with respect thereto other than those
specifically provided in this _Section 6.2_.

(d) At the Acceptance Time, each Company Warrant that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall automatically (and without any
action on the part of any party hereto or the holder thereof) be cancelled and
cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock,
and converted into the right to receive an amount of cash determined by
multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject
to such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, _times_ (B)
the amount by which (x) the Per Share Consideration _exceeds_ (y) the
exercise price per share of such Company Warrant.



 

37 (e) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ such amounts as
Parent or the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold under
the Code, or any provision of state or local Tax law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no deduction or withholding shall be made with respect to amounts
payable in consideration for the Company Warrants if the holder thereof
provides documentation reasonably requested by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation that evidences that such deduction or withholding is not
required.

6.3. Employees, Compensation and Benefits.

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, all employees of the
Company who continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time ("
_Continuing Employees_ ") will be provided with base salary, incentive
compensation opportunities and employee benefits (excluding equity, equity-
based and long-term incentive opportunities) that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than that provided by the Company and immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Parent agrees that the acquisition of shares of Company
Common Stock by Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer shall be deemed a
"change in control" and/or "change of control" for all purposes under each of
the Company Employee Plans and Company Employee Agreements.

(b) If Parent elects not to maintain the Surviving Corporations health,
vacation or 401(k) plans after the Effective Time, then, subject to any Legal
Requirements: (i) all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in
Parents health, vacation and 401(k) plans, to substantially the same extent
as similarly situated employees of Parent; and (ii) for purposes of
determining a Continuing Employees eligibility to participate in such plans,
such Continuing Employee shall receive credit under such plans for his or her
years of continuous service with the Company prior to the Effective Time.
Each such Continuing Employee will receive credit for purposes of eligibility
to participate, level of benefits, vesting and vacation, sick and personal
time off (but not for purposes of benefit accrual) under such plan, program
or policy for years of service with the Company, _provided_ that such credit
does not result in a duplication of benefits, compensation, incentive or
otherwise. Parent shall cause any and all pre-existing condition (or actively
at work or similar) limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of
insurability requirements under Parents employee benefit plans in which
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time to
be waived with respect to such Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents, and shall provide Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents with credit for any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or
similar payments) made during the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs for the purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-
pocket, or similar requirements under any of Parents employee benefit plans
in which they are eligible to participate after the Effective Time.

(c) Nothing in this _Section 6.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
be construed to create a right in any Company Associate to employment with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent. Except
for Indemnified Persons (as defined in _Section 6.4(a)_) to the extent of
their respective rights pursuant to _Section 6.4_, no Company Associate, and
no Continuing Employee, shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of
this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 6.3(c)_ shall limit the effect of 
_Section 9.9_.

(d) Unless otherwise requested by Parent in writing at least two (2) days
prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken)
all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the
day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective, any Company
Employee Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to
qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "). If the
Company is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company
shall provide to Parent prior to the date on which the Acceptance Time occurs
written evidence of the adoption by the Companys board of directors of
resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form
and substance of which shall be subject to the prior review and approval of
Parent). The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of
terminating such Company 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably request.

  

 

38 (e) To the extent any employee notification or consultation requirements are
imposed by applicable Legal Requirements with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions, the Company shall cooperate with Parent to ensure that such
notification or consultation requirements are complied with prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate shall communicate with Continuing Employees regarding post-
Closing employment matters, including post-Closing employee benefits and
compensation, without the prior written approval of Parent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

6.4. Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

(a) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses existing as of the date of this
Agreement in favor of the current (as of the Effective Time) or former
directors or officers of the Company (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") as
provided in the Charter Documents or in any Indemnification Agreement (as
defined below) shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Charter
Documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement or in any
Indemnification Agreements, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify
any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any Indemnified Person; _provided, however_ , that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in favor of such
Indemnified Person in respect of any Action (as defined in  _Section
5.5(b)_) pending or asserted or any claim made against them within such six-
year period shall continue until the final disposition of such Action or
resolution of such claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their respective
terms, each of the covenants contained in this _Section 6.4_. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Indemnification Agreement_ " shall mean
any indemnification agreement between the Company and an Indemnified Person,
as such agreement is in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

(b) Without limitation of any superior rights in the Charter Documents or any
Indemnification Agreement, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, indemnify
and hold harmless each Indemnified Person against any costs or expenses
(including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any Action to each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an "
_Action_ ") arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission by such Indemnified Person occurring or alleged to have occurred at
or before the Effective Time (whether such Action is asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time) in connection with such Indemnified
Person serving as an officer or director of the Company or at the request of
the Company as a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan. In the event of
any such Action, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with
the Indemnified Person in the defense of any such Action.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase and prepay a six-
year "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent
benefits and coverage levels as the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company (the " _Existing D andO Policies"_) with respect to matters arising
at or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the Contemplated
Transactions (the " _Tail Policy_ "); _provided, however_ , that if such
"tail" policy is not available at a cost equal to or less than 300% of the
aggregate annual premiums paid by the Company during the most recent policy
year for the Existing DandO Policies (the " _Maximum Premium Amount_ "), the
Company shall purchase the best coverage as is reasonably available for such
amount. Parent shall cause the Tail Policy to be maintained in full force and
effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored
by the Surviving Corporation. In the event that any of the carriers issuing or
reinsuring the Tail Policy shall become insolvent or otherwise financially
distressed such that any of them is unable to satisfy its financial
obligations under the Tail 



 

39  Policy at any time during the aforementioned six-year period, Parent agrees
that it shall, from time to time, cause the Tail Policy to be replaced with
another prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially
equivalent benefits and coverage levels as the Tail Policy, with a term
extending for the remainder of such six-year period (the " _New Tail Policy_
"); _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the maximum amount that
Parent is required to expend to obtain any New Tail Policy under this _Section
6.4(c)_ exceed the amount by which the Maximum Premium Amount exceeds the sum
of (i) the premium paid by the Company for the Tail Policy _plus_ (ii) the
aggregate premium(s) paid by Parent and the Surviving Corporation to obtain
any other New Tail Policy. In such event, references in this Agreement to the
Tail Policy shall be deemed to include any New Tail Policy, as applicable.

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Person hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Person may have
under the Charter Documents of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, under
any other indemnification arrangement, under the DGCL or otherwise. The
provisions of this  _Section 6.4_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Persons.

(e) This _Section 6.4_ shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving
Corporation and their successors and assigns.

6.5. Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters.

(a) Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file, as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and other
documents required to be filed by such party with any Governmental Body with
respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions, and
to submit promptly any additional information requested by any such
Governmental Body. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company and Parent shall, promptly after the date of this Agreement and in any
event within ten (10) business days, prepare and file: (i) the notification
and report forms required to be filed under the HSR Act in connection with
the Offer, the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions; and (ii) if
required in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other Contemplated
Transactions, all notifications and other documents under all applicable
foreign antitrust- or competition-related Legal Requirements. The Company and
Parent shall respond as promptly as practicable to: (A) any inquiries or
requests received from the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of
Justice for additional information or documentation; and (B) any inquiries or
requests received from any state attorney general, foreign antitrust or
competition authority or other Governmental Body in connection with antitrust
or competition matters. At the request of Parent, the Company shall agree to
divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take
any other action with respect to any of the businesses, product lines or
assets of the Company, _provided_ that any such action is conditioned upon
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in  _Section 6.5(c)_, Parent and
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger and make
effective the other Contemplated Transactions. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, but subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 6.5(c)_, each party to this Agreement: (i) shall make all filings
(if any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such
party or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Offer and the Merger
and the other Contemplated Transactions; (ii) shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required to be obtained
pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement by such party or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Offer and the Merger or any of the other
Contemplated Transactions; and (iii) shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Offer or the
Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions. Each of Parent and the
Company shall provide the other party with a copy of each proposed filing with
or other submission to any Governmental Body relating to any of the
Contemplated Transactions (including the notification and report forms filed
under the HSR Act and other written correspondence with the Federal Trade
Commission or the Department of Justice, or with any state attorney general,
foreign antitrust or competition 



 

40  authority or other Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or
competition matters), and shall give the other party a reasonable time prior
to making such filing or other submission in which to review and comment on
such proposed filing or other submission. Each of Parent and the Company shall
promptly deliver to the other party a copy of each such filing or other
submission made, each notice given and each Consent obtained. Subject to
applicable Legal Requirements and the instructions of any Governmental Body,
the Company and Parent shall keep each other reasonably apprised of the status
of matters relating to the completion of the Contemplated Transactions,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other
written communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
from any Governmental Body and/or third party with respect to such
Contemplated Transactions, and, to the extent practicable under the
circumstances, shall provide the other party and its counsel with the
opportunity to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Body in
respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with
the Contemplated Transactions.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 6.6_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall have
any obligation under this Agreement to take any of the following actions, if
Parent determines in good faith that taking such actions could reasonably be
expected to materially affect the business or interests of Parent, any of
Parents Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation in any adverse way: (i) to
dispose of or transfer or cause any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or
transfer any assets, or to commit to cause the Company to dispose of or
transfer any assets; (ii) to discontinue or cause any of its Subsidiaries to
discontinue offering any product or service, or to commit to cause the Company
to discontinue offering any product or service; (iii) to license or otherwise
make available, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to license or otherwise make
available to any Person any technology, software or other Intellectual
Property or Intellectual Property Right, or to commit to cause the Company to
license or otherwise make available to any Person any technology, software or
other Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Right; (iv) to hold
separate or cause any of its Subsidiaries to hold separate any assets
or operations (either before or after the Closing Date), or to commit to
cause the Company to hold separate any assets or operations; (v) to make or
cause any of its Subsidiaries to make any commitment, or to commit to cause
the Company to make any commitment (to any Governmental Body or otherwise)
regarding its future operations or the future operations of the Company; or
(vi) to contest any Legal Proceeding or any order, writ, injunction or decree
relating to the Offer or the Merger or any of the other Contemplated
Transactions.

6.6. Notification of Certain Matters.

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall promptly notify Parent in
writing of the discovery by the Company of: (i) any event, condition, fact or
circumstance that occurred or existed on or prior to the date of this
Agreement and that caused or constitutes a material inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement; (ii) any
event, condition, fact or circumstance that occurs, arises or exists after the

breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company; and (iv) any event,
condition, fact or circumstance that would make the timely satisfaction of
any of the Offer Conditions or the conditions set forth in _Section 7_
impossible or would make the failure of any such condition reasonably likely.
No notification given to Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.6(a)_ or any
information or knowledge obtained pursuant to _Section 5.1_ shall limit or
otherwise affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
obligations of the Company contained in this Agreement.

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in

Agreement; (ii) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that occurs, arises
or exists after the date of this Agreement and that would cause or constitute
a material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by Parent or
Acquisition Sub in this Agreement if such event, condition, fact or
circumstance had occurred, arisen or existed on or prior to the date of this
Agreement; (iii) any material breach of any covenant or 



 

41  obligation of Parent or Acquisition Sub; and (iv) any event, condition, fact

knowledge obtained pursuant to  _Section 5.1_ shall limit or otherwise
affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants or obligations of
Parent or Acquisition Sub contained in this Agreement.

6.7. Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult with one
another before any press release is issued by a party hereto or any public
statement is made by a party hereto with respect to the Offer, the Merger or
any of the other Contemplated Transactions. Except as otherwise required or
permitted by this Agreement, the parties to this Agreement shall not, and
shall not permit any of their respective Subsidiaries or Representatives to,
make any public disclosure regarding the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Contemplated Transactions unless (a) the other parties shall have approved
such disclosure (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) or (b) such disclosure is required by applicable Legal
Requirements.

6.8. [Intentionally deleted].

6.9. [Intentionally deleted].

the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions or the Stockholder

litigation shall be agreed to by the Company without Parents prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

SECTION 8\. TERMINATION

8.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated:

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company at any time prior to
the Effective Time; 

(b) by either Parent or the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time if
any U.S. court of competent jurisdiction or other U.S. Governmental Body
having authority over Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company shall have issued
a final and nonappealable judgment, order, injunction, writ or decree, or
shall have taken any other action, having the effect of (i) permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting (A) prior to the Acceptance
Time, the acquisition of, or the acceptance for payment or the delivery of

however_ , that (1) the party to this Agreement seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall have used
commercially reasonable efforts to resist or lift such judgment, order,
injunction, writ or decree and (2) a party shall not be permitted to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_ if the issuance of such
judgment, order, injunction, writ or decree is attributable to the failure of
such party to fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement;

(c) by either Parent or the Company at any time after February 15, 2010 (the "
_Termination Date_ ") and prior to the Acceptance Time if the Acceptance Time
shall not have occurred on or prior to the Termination Date; _provided,
however,_ that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ if the failure of the Acceptance Time to
occur on or prior to the Termination Date is attributable to the failure of
such party to fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement; _provided
further_ that, if, on the original Termination Date, the condition set forth
in _clause_ " _(f)_ " of _Exhibit B_ shall not have been satisfied or
fulfilled but all other conditions to the Offer shall have been satisfied or
fulfilled or shall be capable of being satisfied or fulfilled, then the
Termination Date shall automatically be extended until June 15, 2010; 

(d) by Parent at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if a Triggering Event
shall have occurred;

(e) by the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, in order to
accept a Superior Proposal and enter into the Specified Definitive
Acquisition Agreement relating to such Superior Proposal, if (i) such Superior
Proposal shall not have resulted from a breach by the Company of any of the
provisions of _Section 5.3_, (ii) the Company and its board of directors
shall have satisfied in all material respects all of the notice, negotiation
and other requirements set forth in _Section 5.3(g)_ with respect to such

the termination of this Agreement;

(f) by Parent at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if: (i) any of the
Companys representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be
inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement or shall have become inaccurate
as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if made on such
subsequent date), in either case such that the condition set forth in _clause_
" _(a)_ " of _Exhibit B_ or the condition set forth in  _clause_ " _(b)_ "
of _Exhibit B_ would not be satisfied (it being understood that, for purposes
of determining the accuracy of such 



 

43  representations and warranties as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
subsequent date, (A) all "Company Material Adverse Effect" and other
qualifications based on the word "material" contained in such representations
and warranties shall be disregarded and (B) any update of or modification to
the Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made on or after the
date of this Agreement shall be disregarded); or (ii) any of the Companys
covenants contained in this Agreement shall have been breached such that the
condition set forth in _clause_ " _(c)_ " of _Exhibit B_ would not be
satisfied; _ provided, however_ , that if such inaccuracy or breach is
curable by the Company within 30 days after receiving notice thereof and the
Company is continuing to exercise reasonable efforts to cure such inaccuracy
or breach, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(f)_ on account of such inaccuracy or breach (1) during the 30-day period
commencing on the date on which the Company receives notice of such inaccuracy
or breach or (2) after such 30-day period if such inaccuracy or breach shall
have been cured in a manner such that such inaccuracy or breach no longer
results in the applicable condition set forth in _Exhibit B_ not being
satisfied;

(g) by the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if: (i) Parents
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall have failed
to be accurate in all respects as of the date of this Agreement or shall have
failed to be accurate in all respects as of a date subsequent to the date of
this Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date) (in each case, except for
representations and warranties that by their terms are made only as of a
specific date or time, which need only be accurate in all respects as of such
date or time), and the inaccuracy in such representations and warranties has
had or could reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse
effect on Acquisition Subs ability to purchase and pay for shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer or
Parents or Acquisition Subs ability to otherwise consummate the
Contemplated Transactions; _provided, however_ , that, for purposes of
determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties, all "material
adverse effect" and other qualifications based on the word "material"
contained in such representations and warranties shall be disregarded; (ii)
Parent or Acquisition Sub shall have materially failed to comply with or
perform its obligations under  _Sections 1.1(a)_ or _6.5(a);_ or (iii)
Parent or Acquisition Sub shall have materially failed to comply with or
perform each covenant set forth in this Agreement (other than the covenants
set forth in  _Section 8.1(g)(ii)_ above) that Parent or Acquisition Sub is
required to comply with or perform, and such failure has a material adverse
effect on Acquisition Subs ability to purchase and pay for shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer or
Parents or Acquisition Subs ability to otherwise consummate the Contemplated
Transactions; _provided, however_ , that if any inaccuracy or breach described
in _clause _ " _(i)_ ," _clause_ " _(ii)_ " or _clause_ " _(iii)_ " above is
curable by Parent or Acquisition Sub within 30 days after receiving notice
thereof and Parent is continuing to exercise reasonable efforts to cure such
inaccuracy or breach, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 8.1(g)_ on account of such inaccuracy or breach (1) during the
30-day period commencing on the date on which Parent receives notice of such
inaccuracy or breach or (2) after such 30-day period if such inaccuracy or
breach shall have been cured in a manner such that such inaccuracy or breach
no longer has a material adverse effect on Acquisition Subs ability to
purchase and pay for shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not
withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer or Parents or Acquisition Subs ability to
otherwise consummate the Contemplated Transactions; or 

(h) by Parent at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if a Company Material
Adverse Effect shall have occurred; _ provided, however_ , that if the
Company can reasonably expect to cause such Company Material Adverse Effect to
no longer constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect prior to June 15, 2010
and the Company is continuing to exercise reasonable efforts to cause such
Company Material Adverse Effect to no longer constitute a Company Material
Adverse Effect, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 8.1(h)_ on account of such Company Material Adverse Effect prior to
the expiration time of the Offer.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this  _Section 8.1_,
this Agreement may not be terminated by any party unless any fee required to
be paid (or caused to be paid) by such party pursuant to _Section 8.3_ at or
prior to the time of such termination shall have been paid in full.

8.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
as provided in  _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall be of no further force
or effect; _provided, however_ , that (a) this _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_
and 



 

44   _Section 9_ (and the Confidentiality Agreement) shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect, (b)
the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party from any
liability for any prior material breach of any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement and shall not relieve any party from any liability
for any material breach of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement, and (c) no termination of this Agreement shall in any way affect
any of the parties rights or obligations with respect to any shares of
Company Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer prior to such
termination. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) except with
respect to any liability of the Company for any willful or intentional breach
of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the payment of
the Termination Fee (as defined below) shall be the exclusive remedy of
Parent and Acquisition Sub with respect to a termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Sections 8.1(d)_ or _8.1(e)_ or a termination of this Agreement
pursuant to  _Sections 8.1(c)_) followed by payment of the Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_, and (ii) except with respect to any liability
of Parent or Acquisition Sub for any willful or intentional breach of any
covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee (as defined below) pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)_ shall be the
exclusive remedy of the Company with respect to a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to  _Sections 8.1(b)_, _8.1(c)_ or _8.1(g)_ primarily as
a result of or primarily in connection with the failure of the condition set
forth in _clause_ " _(f)_ " of _Exhibit B _to be satisfied or fulfilled.

8.3. Expenses; Termination Fees.

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 8.3_, all expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions shall be
paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not any shares are
purchased pursuant to the Offer and whether or not the Merger is consummated.

(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)_, and (ii) at or prior to the time of the termination of
this Agreement an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed,
announced or commenced (and not withdrawn at least five (5) business days
prior to the time of termination), and (iii) within one (1) year after the
date of termination of this Agreement, (A) an Acquisition Transaction is
consummated or (B) a definitive agreement contemplating an Acquisition
Transaction is executed and such Acquisition Transaction is ultimately
consummated, then the Company shall pay to Parent, in cash at the time such
Acquisition Transaction (as it may have been modified, including any other
Acquisition Transaction among or involving the parties to such definitive
agreement or any of such parties affiliates) is consummated, a nonrefundable
fee in the amount of $8,517,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided,
however_ , that for purposes of  _clause_ " _(iii)_ " above, all references
to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed to refer
to "50%".

(c) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent at any time pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)_ based upon the occurrence of a "Triggering Event", or (ii)
by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_, then the Company shall pay to
Parent, in cash at the time specified in the next sentence, the Termination
Fee. In the case of any termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)_, the fee referred to in the preceding sentence shall be paid
by the Company within two (2) business days after such termination; and in the
case of termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)_, the fee referred to in the preceding sentence shall be paid by the
Company at or prior to the time of such termination.

(d) In the event that the Company has not materially breached its obligations
under _Section 6.5_ and this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Sections 8.1(b)_, _8.1(c)_ or _8.1(g)_ , in each case
primarily as a result of or primarily in connection with the failure of the
condition set forth in  _clause_ " _(f)_ " of _Exhibit B _to be satisfied
or fulfilled, then Parent shall pay to the Company, in cash, a nonrefundable
fee in the amount of the Parent Termination Fee within two (2) business
days following such termination.

(e) If the Company fails to pay when due any amount payable under  _Section
8.3(b)_ or _Section 8.3(c)_, then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for
all reasonable costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of legal
counsel) actually incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue
amount and the enforcement 



 

45  by Parent of its rights under this _Section 8.3_, and (ii) the Company
shall pay to Parent interest on any amount that is overdue (for the period
during which such amount is overdue) at a rate per annum equal to 300 basis
points over the "prime rate" (as announced by Bank of America or any successor
thereto) in effect on the date such amount was originally required to be paid.

(f) If Parent fails to pay when due any amount payable under _Section
8.3(d)_, then (i) Parent shall reimburse the Company for all reasonable costs
and expenses (including fees and disbursements of legal counsel) actually
incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount and the
enforcement by the Company of its rights under this  _Section 8.3_, and (ii)

enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the parties hereto and

this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any
attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights by any party
without such consent shall be void and of no effect. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever upon any Person (other than (i) the
parties hereto and (ii) the Indemnified Persons to the extent of their
respective rights pursuant to _Section 6.4_).
