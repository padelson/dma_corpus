a.Buyer's Calculation. Buyer shall deliver to Sellers' Representative as soon

Closing, a statement (the "Adjustment Statement") setting forth Buyer's good
faith determination of the Closing Date Cash Amount, Closing Date Indebtedness
Amount (including, for the avoidance of doubt, obligations for bonuses,
commissions, incentives or similar arrangements), Closing Date Working Capital
Amount, the Company Transaction Expenses and the Tax Amount. Failure to
deliver the Adjustment Statement within such ninety (90) day period shall
constitute Buyer's final and binding acceptance of the Estimated Cash Amount,
the Estimated Indebtedness Amount, the Estimated Working Capital Amount and
the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses as the Closing Date Cash Amount,
Closing Date Indebtedness Amount, Closing Date Working Capital Amount, and the
Company Transaction Expenses, respectively. If Buyer timely delivers an
Adjustment Statement or fails to deliver an Adjustment Statement by the end of
such ninety (90) day period, then Sellers' Representative shall be entitled to
(i) object to any of Buyer's calculations in the Adjustment Statement or (ii)
propose any revisions to the Estimated Cash Amount, the Estimated Indebtedness
Amount, the Estimated Working Capital Amount, the Estimated Company
Transaction Expenses and the Tax Amount as the Sellers' Representative
determines to be appropriate; provided that any revised amounts shall be
calculated in accordance with this Agreement (in each case, the "Objections").
Sellers' Representative shall notify Buyer no later than thirty (30) days
after Sellers' Representative's receipt of the Adjustment Statement from Buyer
or expiration of the ninety (90) day period, as the case may be, setting forth
with reasonable specificity its Objections. If Sellers' Representative timely
delivers notice of any Objections, Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall
endeavor in good faith, during the thirty (30) day period commencing on the
date of delivery of such notice of Objections (or such longer period as the
Parties may then agree, the "Resolution Period"), to resolve the Objections.
Any items set forth in the Adjustment Statement as to which Sellers'
Representative does not make a timely objection will be final and binding on
the Parties as proposed by Buyer. From the Closing Date until final
determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount, Buyer shall, and shall
cause the Company to, make available during normal business hours to Sellers'
Representative such books, records and personnel as Sellers' Representative
may reasonably request in connection with assessing the existence of or
resolving any Objections.



b.Dispute Resolution. If at the end of the Resolution Period there are any
unresolved Objections, Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall submit the
calculation and resolution of such unresolved Objections to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the "Independent Accountant"). The Independent
Accountant shall be instructed to resolve the Objections and such resolution
shall be (i) set forth in writing and signed by the Independent Accountant,
(ii) delivered to Buyer and Sellers' Representative as soon as practicable
after the Objections are submitted to the Independent Accountant, (iii) made
in accordance with this Agreement, including the Accounting Methodologies, and
(iv) conclusive and binding on the Parties on the date of delivery of such
resolution. Buyer and Sellers' Representative will each use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accountant to (x) render a final
report setting forth its determination within thirty (30) days after referral
of the Objections to such firm or such longer period as the Buyer and Sellers'
Representative shall agree, and (y) furnish a draft of such report for review
by Buyer and Sellers' Representative at least five (5) Business Days before
its delivery of the final report. The Independent Accountant shall only decide
the Objections submitted to it, and with respect to each, shall not assign any
value that is greater than the highest value for such amount claimed by either
Sellers' Representative or Buyer or that is less than the lowest value for
such amount claimed by Sellers' Representative or Buyer. The Independent
Accountant shall base its decision solely upon the presentations of the
Parties to the Independent Accountant at a hearing held before the Independent
Accountant and upon any materials made available by either Party and not upon
independent review. The costs and fees of the Independent Accountant shall be
borne by Sellers' Representative on the one hand, and Buyer on the other hand,
in the inverse 

proportion that the contested amounts relating to the Objections submitted to
the Independent Accountant and awarded to such Party bears to the total
contested amounts relating to such Objections, as determined by the
Independent Accountant. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
dispute resolution mechanism contained in this Section 2.5(b) will be the
exclusive mechanism for resolving any disputes regarding the items required to
be included in the Adjustment Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Buyer and Sellers' Representative
acknowledge and agree that (i) any Objection relating to the Tax Amount shall
be resolved pursuant to the dispute resolutions procedures set forth in this
Section 2.5 and (ii) there shall be no extension of the timeframe for dispute
resolution procedures described herein in connection with the Tax Amount or to
otherwise facilitate the determination of any Tax Amount by the IRS or other
Governmental Authority.



c.Adjustment Amount. Following the examination, review and, if applicable,
resolution of any Objections in accordance with the dispute resolution
procedure set out in Section 2.5(b), the Purchase Price shall be adjusted as
described herein. The amount of such adjustment (the "Post-Closing Adjustment
Amount") shall be equal to the sum of (i) the Closing Date Cash Amount (as
finally determined) minus the Estimated Cash Amount, (ii) the Estimated
Indebtedness Amount minus the Closing Date Indebtedness Amount (as finally
determined), (iii) the Closing Date Working Capital Amount (as finally
determined) minus the Estimated Working Capital Amount, (iv) the Estimated
Company Transaction Expenses minus the Company Transaction Expenses (as
finally determined) and (v) the Prepaid Tax Amount minus the Tax Amount. If
the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a positive number, Buyer shall pay to
Sellers' Representative on behalf of the Sellers an amount equal thereto; if
the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a negative number, Sellers shall pay
Buyer an amount equal thereto, in each case, as described in Section 2.5(d)
below.



d.Payment. Payment of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount shall be made by
Buyer or Sellers, as the case may be, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds according to the wire transfer instructions designated by the
Party entitled to such payment no later than five (5) Business Days following,
as applicable: (i) the date on which the Parties agree among themselves on a
resolution to all Objections, (ii) the date on which the period for delivery
of Objections by Sellers' Representative pursuant to Section 2.5(a) has
expired if no notice of Objections has been delivered by such date, (iii) if
any Objections are timely asserted and not otherwise resolved among the
Parties, the date on which the procedures for resolution of the Objections as
set forth in Section 2.5(b) have been completed and the Independent Accountant
has issued its final report as to the resolution of the Objections. If any
amount is due from Sellers pursuant to this Section 2.5, such amount shall be
satisfied exclusively from the Adjustment Escrow Fund to the extent funds are
available therein. For the avoidance of doubt, the Adjustment Escrow Fund
shall be the sole source of funds for any payment by the Sellers to Buyer
pursuant to this Section 2.5 and Sellers shall have no liability for any
shortfall if the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is payable to Buyer and such
amount exceeds the amount of the Adjustment Escrow Fund. Buyer and Sellers'
Representative agree to cooperate in good faith in the prompt preparation and
delivery of any joint instruction required to be given pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer and Sellers' Representative
shall, upon the final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount in
accordance with Section 2.5(c), provide a joint instruction directing that (A)
an amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount be disbursed to Buyer to
the extent such amount is due to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.5(c) and the
balance then remaining in the Adjustment Escrow Fund after deduction of such
Post-Closing Adjustment Amount, be disbursed to Sellers' Representative for
further distribution to the Sellers or (B) the entire Adjustment Escrow Fund
be disbursed to Sellers' Representative for further distribution to the
Sellers if the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is payable by Buyer. For tax
purposes, any payment by the Buyer or the Sellers under this Section 2.5 shall
be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

exclusive owner of all right, title and interest in and to, all Owned

exploited by the Company prior to the Closing. The Company does not
exclusively license any Intellectual Property.



c.Neither the Company nor any of the products and services of the Company, nor
the operation of the Business, have infringed upon, misappropriated or
otherwise violated, nor infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate,
any Intellectual Property of any Person, and the Company has not received any
notice regarding any such actual, or alleged infringement, misappropriation or
violation by the Company (including any "invitation to license" as a means to
avoid infringement or potential infringement of any Intellectual Property). To
the Company's Knowledge, no Person has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated any Owned Intellectual Property rights or any Business Intellectual
Property in any manner that would have a material effect on the Company or the
Business.

item identified on Section 3.9(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and any

Licensed Intellectual Property, other than off the shelf software licensed on
non-exclusive generally available commercial terms for a total cost to the
Company, including any maintenance and support costs, of more than $25,000.
All Contracts under which the Company obtains any right, title or interest in
or to any Licensed Intellectual Property are valid and enforceable, and the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will not affect the
validity or enforceability, or constitute or result in a breach or violation,
of any such sublicense, license or Contract. The Licensed Intellectual
Property required to be identified on Section 3.9(e) of the Company Disclosure

invented, created, developed, conceived or reduced to practice during the
course of their employment or work for the Company. No current or former

such agreement. No current or former employee, officer, consultant or
contractor of the Company has any claim, right or interest in or to any Owned
Intellectual Property.



g.All software owned or purported to be owned by the Company ("Owned
Software"), including all source code for all Owned Software, is in the sole
possession and custody of the Company and has not been provided to any other
Person. Neither the Company, nor any Person acting on behalf of the Company,
has provided, disclosed or delivered, or permitted the disclosure or delivery
to any Person of any Owned Software. No part of any Owned Software is copied
from, based upon, or derived from any Intellectual Property of any other
Person. No Owned Software contains any functionality designed to disable a
computer program automatically with the passage of time or under the positive
control of any unauthorized person, any unauthorized code (i.e., any virus,
Trojan horse, worm or other similar software routines), or any other
functionality enabling unauthorized access or operation thereto or thereof.
The Company owns or has the right to exploit, and after Closing will continue
to own or have the right to exploit, each item of Owned Software in the same
manner and to the same extent as it was used prior to the Closing. The Company
has at all times obtained and maintained all licenses (in sufficient
quantities and under sufficient terms) necessary or required for the Company

and information Processed by the Company, including information regarding the

use or alteration of the Company Systems and any such data or information. The
Company has at all times maintained compliance with such policies and all
Information Laws. There has been no suspected or actual security breach,
violation of any security policy, or unauthorized access to, acquisition, use,
loss, denial or loss of use, destruction, compromise or disclosure of any
Company Systems or any data or information Processed by or on behalf of the
Company. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will not
cause, constitute or result in a breach or violation of any applicable
Information Laws by or on behalf of the Company.

withheld or delayed). Nothing in this Section 7.2(b) will prohibit the Buyer
from contacting the customers, suppliers, distributors or licensors of the
Company in the ordinary course of the Buyer's businesses as currently
conducted for the purpose of selling products of the Buyer's business or for
any other purpose unrelated to the Company and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

submitted or directed exclusively to Trevor Humphrey or such other individuals
as Sellers' Representative may designate in writing from time to time.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall
not be required to disclose any information to Buyer during the Pre-Closing
Period if such disclosure would, in the Company's sole discretion: (i)
jeopardize any attorney-client or other privilege; or (ii) contravene any
applicable Law or fiduciary duty.



Section 7.3 Notification of Certain Matters. During the Pre-Closing Period,
the Sellers' Representative and the Buyer shall notify the other in writing of

collectively, the "Antitrust Filings" and each, an "Antitrust Filing"), and
(iii) comply at the earliest reasonably practicable date with any formal or
informal request under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws for additional

confirmations under any Antitrust Law in connection with consummating the
transactions contemplated hereby and relating to any actual, pending or
threatened litigation arising in connection with an Antitrust Filing.



b.Subject to Buyer's right to direct strategy as set forth above, and provided
that written materials may be redacted as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements and as necessary to address privilege or other confidentiality
concerns, the Sellers' Representative and the Buyer and/or their respective
outside antitrust counsel will keep each other apprised of the status of, and
work cooperatively in connection with obtaining, the requisite authorization

changes suggested in connection with any such filing; (ii) furnishing to each
other all information required for any application or other filing to be made
with respect to any authorization sought from an Antitrust A

any Proceeding before, any Antitrust Authority with respect to the

such meetings or discussions; and (vi) consulting and cooperating with one
another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or

Antitrust Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Proceedings relating thereto. If either Party or any
Affiliate or Representative thereof receives a request for additional
information or documentary material from an Antitrust Authority with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such Party will
endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as practicable
and after consultation with the other Party, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request. Each Party will advise the other Party promptly
in respect of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written)
which such Party proposes to make or enter into with any Antitrust Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, it being
understood and agreed that the Sellers' Representative shall not make or enter
into any undertakings or agreements of any kind with any Antitrust Authority
without the prior written consent of Buyer in each instance.



c.Buyer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) resolve
objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law and (ii) take any and
all actions required by any Antitrust Authority as a condition to grant any
consent necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or as may be required to avoid (or eliminate) each and every
impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Antitrust
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so
as to enable the consummation of such transactions contemplated hereby to
occur as expeditiously as possible, including without limitation, proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting (by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise) the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or
businesses of the Buyer or its Affiliates, or of the Company following the
Closing (or otherwise taking or committing to take any action that limits its
freedom of action with respect to any of the businesses, product lines or
assets of the Buyer or its Affiliates, or of the Company following the
Closing) as may be required to obtain such a consent of an Antitrust Authority
or in order to avoid the pursuit or entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any injunction, temporary restraining order or other Judgment in any
Proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, nothing in this paragraph 7.5(c) or in any other provision of this
Agreement shall obligate Buyer to (A) instigate, defend or participate in any
Proceeding of any kind or pay any fees or other payments to any Governmental
Authorities in order to obtain any consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications or orders as are necessary for the consummation of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (other than filing fees
that are imposed by Law on any of the Parties), or (B) take any action or
actions that would, in the reasonable opinion of Buyer, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
assets or businesses of the Buyer, taken as a whole.



d.Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Sellers and the Company
shall give such notices to, and request and use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such consents and estoppel certificates from, the
counterparties to the notices, consents and estoppel certificates contemplated
b 

y Section 6.4, provided, however, in no event will the Sellers or the Company
be obligated to pay any money to any Person or to offer or grant financial or
other accommodations to any Person in connection with such efforts.

this Agreement are not conditioned in any manner whatsoever upon the Buyer
obtaining any financing.

requested by the Buyer in connection with the preparation of, and review

unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Business or management of the

the Buyer, or (3) take any action that could cause its directors, officers, or
stockholders to incur personal liability. The failure of the Company to

Section 7.6(b) shall not affect any right the Sellers' Representative may
otherwise have under Section 10.1(b) or Section 10.1(d).



c.The Company shall, at least ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing, deliver
to the Buyer a list of all letters of credit, if any, to be cash
collateralized or backstopped with a letter of credit at Closing in connection
with the termination and prepayment of Indebtedness.

other Person to any continued employment with the Company, Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates.

bound by an obligation of confidentiality not to disclose such information.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will this Section 8.2 limit or
otherwise restrict the right of the Sellers to disclose such Company
Information (A) to its and its Affiliates' respective Representatives to the
extent reasonably required to facilitate the

in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Company except to the
extent such practice is prohibited by law. Sellers' Representative shall
provide Buyer with a draft copy of any such Tax Return at least thirty (30)
days prior to the due date of such Tax Return, and Sellers' Representative
shall make all changes to such Tax Returns that are reasonably requested by
Buyer. Buyer shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due with respect to
such Tax Returns for any tax period ending on or after the Closing Date with
or at the time of filing of such Tax Returns, which Tax payments are intended
to be taken into account in the computation of the Tax Amount under Section
2.5. Buyer shall not amend any Company Tax Return for any period ending on or
before the Closing Date, or a Tax Return covered by Section 8.3(a)(ii) if such
Tax Return includes a Straddle Period, without the consent of the Sellers'
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; provided, however, Buyer shall be permitted to amend any such Tax
Return if Buyer, prior to filing such amended Tax Return, provides Sellers'
Representative with a written agreement reasonably satisfactory to Sellers'
Representative agreeing to hold Sellers harmless and indemnify Sellers for any
Taxes or other liabilities assessed against Company or the Sellers, including
any loss, reduction or repayment of any refund, credit or similar benefit that
would have been subsequently assessed against the Company with respect to such
Tax Return and to which the Sellers would have been entitled to receive, but
for such amended Tax Return.



ii.Sellers' Representative shall prepare all Q1 2020 Tax Returns, except for
Q1 2020 Tax Returns that are Straddle Period Tax Returns and Buyer shall
prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns that are required to be filed

Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"). All Q1 2020 Tax Returns, including Q1 2020

shall make all changes to such Tax Returns that are reasonably requested by
Sellers' Representative. Sellers' Representative shall provide Buyer with a
draft copy of any Q1 2020 Tax Return Sellers Representative is required to
prepare promptly following the Closing, and Sellers' Representative shall make

iii.In the case of any Straddle Period, the Taxes attributable to the portion
of such period ending on the Closing Date shall (A) in the case of any Taxes
based upon or measured by income, receipts or payroll, be deemed equal to the
amount of such Taxes that would be payable if a taxable period ending on the
Closing Date; provided, however, that allowances, deduction or exemptions that
are calculated or an annual basis shall be apportioned on a daily basis to
such portion of the Straddle Period, and (B) in the case of all other Taxes,
shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes due for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire such Straddle Period.



b.Cooperation on Tax Matters. From and after the Closing, the Buyer, the
Company, and Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other parties and at the sole cost and expense of the
requesting party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns, the filing of

consent of the Sellers' Representative) and the authorization and execution of
any appropriate powers of attorney to accomplish the foregoing. Neither the
Buyer nor any of the Company shall destroy or dispose of any Tax workpapers,
schedules or other materials and documents supporting Tax Returns of the
Company for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date prior to
the tenth anniversary of the Closing Date, without the prior written consent
of Sellers' Representative, and before any disposition or destruction of such
materials at any time, the Buyer shall give thirty (30) days prior written
notice of any such proposed disposition or destruction to the Sellers'
Representative, and the Sellers' Representative shall have the right, in its
sole discretion, to take possession of such materials and documents.

be determined pursuant to Section 2.5, Buyer shall have the right to control
any Tax Controversy with respect to a taxable period of the Company. With
respect to any Tax Controversy related to a Tax Return for a taxable period of
the Company described in Section 8.3(a)(i) or Section 8.3(a)(ii), Buyer shall
keep the Sellers' Representative reasonably informed regarding the progress
and all substantive aspects of such Tax Controversy, including providing the
Sellers' Representative with copies of (i) all notices or other written all
substantive materials relating to such Tax Controversy received from the
relevant tax authority and (ii) all substantive written materials submitted to
such tax authority by Buyer, within five (5) days of receipt or submission of
the notice or written materials from or to such taxing authority. Buyer shall
not settle or compromise any such Tax Controversy related to a Tax Return for
a taxable period of the Company described in Section 8.3(a)(i) or Section
8.3(a)(ii) without the consent of the Sellers' Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided, however,
Buyer shall have the right to consent to a settlement or compromise under this
Section 8.3(c) to the extent that Buyer, prior to consenting to such
settlement or compromise, provides Sellers' Representative with a written
agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Sellers'
Representative, to indemnify and hold Sellers harmless for any Taxes or other
liabilities assessed against Company or the Sellers, including any loss,
reduction or repayment of any refund, credit or similar benefit that would
have been payable to the Company and to which the Sellers would have been
entitled to receive, but for the settlement of such Tax Controversy.



d.Transfer Taxes. The Buyer shall be liable for all Transfer Taxes that become
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of
whether such Taxes are imposed on any Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Seller determines in its sole
discretion that it is required by applicable Law to pay any Transfer Taxes,
then such Seller will pay such Transfer Taxes, and the Buyer will, subject to
receipt of satisfactory evidence of the Seller's payment thereof, promptly
reimburse the applicable Seller, whether or not such Transfer Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed by the applicable Governmental Authority. The
Buyer will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to such Taxes. If required by applicable Law, the
Sellers will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of such
Tax Returns or other documentation.



e.Tax Refunds. Sellers shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes that is
received by the Company with respect to a taxable period ending before the
Closing Date, or which is attributable to the portion of a Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date (as determined in a manner consistent with Section
8.3(a)(iii)), and Buyer shall remit to Sellers the amount of such refund for
Taxes no later than three (3) days after the receipt of such refund for Taxes,
except that no such refund of Taxes shall be paid to the Sellers to the extent
that (i) such refund received or paid to the Company is with respect to an
amended Tax Return filed by the Company, including an amended Straddle Period
Tax Return to the extent that such refund relates t 

o the portion of the Straddle Period beginning before and ending on the
Closing Date, and (ii) such refund of Taxes is in excess of the refund that
was claimed on such Tax Return as originally filed and not yet paid to the
account of the Sellers in accordance with the provisions of this Section
8.3(e), provided that Buyer has provided Sellers' Representative with such
written agreement as is set forth in Section 8.3(a)(i) above. For the
avoidance of doubt, any Prepaid Tax Amount that has been taken into account in
calculating the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section 2.5 shall
not be a refund to which Sellers are entitled pursuant to this Section 8.3(e).



f.No Section 338 Election. No Party shall make any election under Code Section
338 to cause the purchase of the Company to be treated as an acquisition of
assets.



g.No Extraordinary Transactions on Closing Date. The Company shall not, and
Buyer shall not permit the Company to, engage in any transactions outside the
Ordinary Course of Business on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, if the Company does engage in any transactions
outside the Ordinary Course of Business on the Closing Date, Buyer shall be
liable for any Taxes attributable to any such transactions.



Section 8.4 Indemnification and Insurance.



a.The Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation
(including advancement of expenses) existing in favor of, and all limitations
on the personal liability of, each present and former director, manager or
officer of the Company (the "DandO Indemnified Parties") provided for in their
respective charters, by-laws, other organizational documents or any other
agreements in effect as of the date hereof shall continue in full force and
effect until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing and shall not be
amended, replaced or otherwise modified prior to such date in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights of the DandO Indemnified Parties thereunder as
contemplated herein, unless such modification is required by applicable Law.
From and after the Closing, the Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless,
and cause the Company to indemnify and hold harmless, the present and former

ARTICLE IX

NO SURVIVAL; CERTAIN WAIVERS



Section 9.1 No Survival; Certain Waivers. The representations and warranties
of the Parties contained herein shall not survive, and shall terminate
effective immediately as of, the Closing, such that no claim for breach of any
such representation or warranty, detrimental reliance or other right or remedy
(whether in contract, in tort or at law or equity) may be brought after the
Closing, except with respect to claims for fraud with respect to any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement.
The covenants of the Parties contained herein to the extent contemplating or
requiring performance at or prior to the Closing shall not survive, and shall
terminate effective immediately as of, the Closing, such that no claim for
breach of any such covenant, detrimental reliance or other right or remedy
(whether in contract, in tort or at law or equity) may be brought after the
Closing. Each covenant of any Party contained herein which by its terms
requires performance after the Closing (the "Surviving Covenants") shall
survive the Closing until fully performed in accordance with its terms and
nothing in this Section 9.1 shall be deemed to limit any rights or remedies of
any Person for breach of any such covenant (it being understood that the Buyer
shall also be liable for breach of any covenant or agreement requiring
performance by the Company after the Closing and that nothing herein shall
limit or affect Buyer's or any of its Affiliates' liability for the failure to
pay any amounts as required under this Agreement). No claim for breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement may be brought by any
Party after such applicable survival period set forth above ends, except with
respect to claims for fraud with respect to any representation, warranty,
covenant or any other agreement contained herein. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Parties (i) intend the foregoing sentences of this Section 9.1 and all
other time limitations herein to operate as a contractual statute of
limitations and to shorten, replace and supersede any statute of limitations
that may otherwise be applicable to claims for breaches of representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements (except in the case of fraud), (ii)
acknowledge and agree that such shortening, replacement and supersession of
any such statute of limitations by such contractual statute of limitations is
reasonable and appropriate and (iii) acknowledge and agree that no Party may
seek rescission of the agreements contemplated by this Section 9.1.



Section 9.2 Waiver of Certain Claims. Buyer, for itself and on behalf of all
Buyer Related Parties (including, after the Closing, the Company),
acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing, to the maximum
extent permitted by Law, any and all entitlements, rights, remedies, claims
and causes of action it or they may have against the Sellers or any of their
post-Closing Affiliates with respect to any matter in any way relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein or arising in connection
with this Agreement or such transactions, whether in contract, tort, under any
Laws, at common law or otherwise (other than claims against Sellers for fraud
with respect to any representation, warranty, covenant or any other agreement
contained in this Agreement and claims for breaches of Surviving Covenants),
are hereby fully, irrevocably and unconditionally waived. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Buyer Related Parties
may not avoid the aforementioned limitation on liability by (i) seeking
damages for breach of contract, tort, or pursuant to any other theory of
liability (including under Rule 10b-5 promulgated under the Securities Act),
all of which are hereby waived, or (ii) asserting or threatening a claim
against any Person that is not a party hereto (or a successor to a party
hereto) for breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement (other than claims against Sellers for
fraud with respect to any representation, warranty, covenant or any other
agreement contained herein and claims for breaches of Surviving Covenants).
The limits imposed on the Buyer Related Parties' remedies with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby were specifically bargained
for between sophisticated parties, were specifically taken into account in the
determination of the amounts to be paid to the Sellers hereunder and Buyer's
commitment to obtain the RandW Insurance Policy are an integral 

part of the transactions contemplated hereby, and, without these limitations,
the Sellers would not enter into this Agreement.

be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or
observance of any of the terms, provisions, or conditions of this Agreement.

Agreement (the "Outside Date"), provided that the Party seeking to terminate
shall not be entitled to terminate pursuant to this Section 10.1(b) if the

Sellers' Representative does not notify Buyer within five (5) Business Days of
receipt of a notice of termination from Buyer that Sellers' Representative

this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions
set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b), and such breach, inaccuracy, or
failure has not been cured by the Sellers or the Company, if capable of being

Representative terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(d) or (b)
Buyer delivers written notice to Sellers' Representative of Buyer's intention
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(b) and Sellers'
Representative timely delivers the notice of objection contemplated by the

acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 10.3 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, that the Sellers would not

circumstances described in this Section 10.3. In the event this Agreement is
terminated and the Company 

is entitled to receive a Termination Fee, the Termination Fee shall be the

breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which it is
entitled at law or in equity. Any requirements for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy are waived. Sellers, Sellers'
Representative and the Company hereby irrevocably waive, and agree not to
assert or attempt to assert, by way of motion or other request for leave from
the court, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any claim
or argument that there is an adequate remedy at law or that an award of
specific performance is not otherwise an available or appropriate remedy. In
no event shall Sellers or the Company seek any (a) equitable relief or 

equitable remedies of any kind whatsoever or (b) monetary damages or any other
recovery, judgment or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect
or punitive damages, other than damages in an amount not in excess of the
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 10.3.



Section 11.7 Amendment and Waiver. To be effective, any amendment or waiver
under this Agreement must be in writing and signed by Buyer and Sellers'
Representative. Neither the failure of any Party to exercise any right, power
or remedy provided under this Agreement or to insist upon compliance by
another Party with its obligations hereunder, nor any custom or practice of
the Parties at variance with the terms hereof shall constitute a waiver by
such Party or Parties of the right to exercise any such right, power or remedy
or to demand such compliance.



Section 11.8 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement,
the Confidentiality Agreement, and the Company Disclosure Schedule, Schedules,
Exhibits and Annexes attached hereto (each of which are incorporated herein)
set forth all of the promises, covenants, agreements, conditions and
undertakings between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof,
and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements and understandings,
negotiations, inducements or conditions relating thereto, express or implied,
oral or written. This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person
other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder, except for the
provisions of Section 8.4, to the extent they relate to DandO Indemnified
Parties not a party to this Agreement.



Section 11.9 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable
of being enforced under any rule of Law in any particular respect or under any
particular circumstances, such term or provision shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect in all other respects and under all other circumstances,
and all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to Buyer or Sellers. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.



Section 11.10 Counterparts; Signatures. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be deemed one and the same instrument. A signed copy of this
Agreement (or a signature page hereto) delivered by facsimile, e-mail, ".pdf"
format, or other means of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the
same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this Agreement.



Section 11.11 Transfer of Privilege; Conflicts.



a.The Buyer acknowledges the fact that Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP ("ES")
has represented the Sellers' Representative and the Company in connection with
the transactions provided for herein and agrees that, effective upon the
Closing, the Company shall, without the necessity of further documentation of
transfer, be deemed to have irrevocably assigned and transferred to the
Sellers' Representative all of their right to, title to and interest in all
communications with, and work product of, ES as they relate to this Agreement,
the documents related hereto and the preparation and negotiation thereof,
together with all written or other materials consisting of, containing,
summarizing or embodying such communications and work product (collectively,
the "Privilege Items"). The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the intent and
effect of this provision is to grant the Sellers' Representative control over
the exercise of t 

he attorney-client privilege held by the Company, if any, in respect of this
Agreement and the Privilege Items.



b.If, subsequent to the Closing, any dispute (a "Dispute") arises relating in
any manner to this Agreement or any agreement delivered in connection herewith
between the Sellers' Representative on the one hand, and the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates on the other hand, the Buyer, for itself and its Affiliates,
hereby consents to ES's representation of the Sellers' Representative with
respect to such Disputes and waives any conflict of interest that may exist by
reason of such representation. The Buyer acknowledges that ES, in connection
with its representation of the Company, has and will have obtained
confidential information of the Company, and agrees that such information may
be used on behalf of the Sellers' Representative in connection with such
Dispute at the sole discretion of Sellers' Representative, notwithstanding a
claim of privilege or work-product the Company may otherwise be entitled to
assert, if any.
