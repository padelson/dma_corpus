to provisions of the Organizational Documents of the Company.

 



 

Section 1.2 _Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in full
consideration for the Units and the other agreements and covenants contained
in this Agreement, the aggregate purchase price (the " _Purchase Price_ ") for

(ii) plus or minus (as applicable) the Net Working Capital Adjustment, if any;

(ii) plus or minus (as applicable) the Estimated Net Working Capital
Adjustment, if any;

 



 

(iii) plus the aggregate amount of Estimated Closing Date Cash;

 



 

(iv) minus the aggregate amount of all Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness;
and

 



 

(v) minus the aggregate amount of the Estimated Transaction Expenses.

 



 

The Estimated Purchase Price shall be subject to post-Closing adjustment in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.5_.

 



 

Section 1.3 _Closing Date_. The purchase and sale of the Units (the "
_Closing_ ") provided for in this Agreement will take place at the offices of
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York 10019,
at 10:00 A.M., New York time, on the first Friday that is at least two (2)
Business Days following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to
Closing in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver
of those conditions), or at such other time and place as the Parties may agree
upon in writing. The date and time on which the Closing actually takes place
is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_."

 



 

Section 1.4 _Closing Deliveries_.

 



 

(a) At the Closing, Seller and the Company will deliver to Buyer:

 



 

(i) a duly executed unit power transferring Sellers ownership of the Units to

against any of the Companys assets or the Units due to such Closing Date
Indebtedness;

 



 

(v) if requested by Buyer prior to the Closing Date, resignations, in form and
substance satisfactory to Buyer and the Company, effective as of the Closing,
duly executed by each director and officer, if any, of the Company;

 



 

(vi) a certificate of non-foreign status duly completed and executed by Seller

U.S. federal income tax purposes of Seller), dated as of the Closing Date,
substantially in the form of the sample certification set forth in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B); and

 



 

(vii) all other documents, instruments or writings required to be delivered to
Buyer at or prior to the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement and such

requests.

 



 

(b) At the Closing, Buyer will deliver to Seller:

 



 

(i) the Estimated Purchase Price, in accordance with _Section 1.2(_b);

(iii) all other documents, instruments or writings required to be delivered to
Seller at or prior to the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement and such
other certificates of authority and similar instruments as Seller reasonably
requests.

 



 

Section 1.5 _Adjustments to Net Working Capital, Closing Date Cash, Closing
Date Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses_.

 



 

(a) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to Closing, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer reasonable, good faith estimates of (i) the
Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Net Working Capital_ ")
and the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment, if any, (ii) the Closing
Date Cash (the " _Estimated Closing Date Cash_ "), (iii) the Closing Date
Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness_ "), and (iv) the
Transaction Expenses

 



      
 

 



 

(the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "). Such estimates shall be prepared
consistently with the Financial Statements and, with respect to the Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital, be calculated in the same manner as reflected on
_Schedule 1.5(b)_, and all estimates shall be accompanied by reasonable
documentation in support of such estimates.

 



 

(b) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than forty-five (45) days
following the Closing, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller proposed
final calculations (the " _Closing Statement_ ") of (i) the Closing Net
Working Capital, (ii) the Closing Date Cash, (iii) the Closing Date
Indebtedness, and (iv) the Transaction Expenses. The Closing Statement shall
be prepared consistently with the Financial Statements and, with respect to
the Closing Net Working Capital, be calculated in the same manner as reflected
on _Schedule 1.5(b)_.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall deliver a copy of the Closing Statement to Seller promptly
after it has been prepared. After receipt of the Closing Statement, Seller
shall have twenty (20) days to review the Closing Statement, together with the
work papers used in the preparation thereof. Buyer shall (i) provide Seller
and its representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to all
relevant personnel, work papers, trial balances and other financial
information to the extent necessary to complete their review of the Closing
Statement, and (ii) cooperate with Seller and its representatives reasonable
requests with respect to the review of the Closing Statement. Unless Seller
delivers written notice to Buyer on or prior to the twentieth (20th) day after
Sellers receipt of the Closing Statement specifying in reasonable detail the
amount, nature and basis of all disputed items (the " _Dispute Notice_ "),
Seller shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the calculations of the
Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Cash, the Closing Date
Indebtedness, and the Transaction Expenses in the Closing Statement. If Seller
notifies Buyer of an objection to any such calculation contained in the
Closing Statement, Buyer and Seller shall, within twenty (20) days (or such
longer period as the Parties may agree in writing) following such notice (the
" _Resolution Period_ "), attempt to resolve their differences and any
resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and
conclusive (other than as a result of manifest error or fraud).

 



 

(d) If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, there are any amounts
remaining in dispute, then such amounts remaining in dispute (and only such
amounts) shall be submitted to KPMG, LLP (the " _Neutral Auditor_ "). The
Neutral Auditor shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on the
provisions of this _Section 1.5(d)_, _Schedule 1.5(b)_, and the
presentations by Seller and Buyer, and not by independent review, only those
issues still in dispute. The Neutral Auditor shall not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by Buyer or Seller,
or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by Buyer or Seller, as
set forth in the Closing Statement or the Dispute Notice, and shall not
propose to adjust any amounts which were not disputed in the Dispute Notice.
No Party shall engage in any _ex parte_ communications with the Neutral
Auditor. The Neutral Auditors determination shall be made within thirty (30)
days of the dispute being submitted for their determination (subject to any
extension that Seller and Buyer may mutually agree on in their sole
discretion), shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to Seller and
Buyer and shall be final, non-appealable and binding on the Parties, absent
manifest error or fraud. A judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction may
be entered upon the Neutral Auditors determination. The Neutral Auditor shall
have exclusive jurisdiction over, and resort to the Neutral Auditor as
provided in this _Section 1.5(d)_ shall be the only recourse and remedy of
the Parties against one another with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to, any disputes arising out of or relating to the adjustments
pursuant to this _Section 1.5(d)_. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Neutral Auditor shall be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and by Seller, on
the other, based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested
amounts not awarded to each Party bears to the amounts actually contested by
such Party. For example, if Seller claims that the Closing Net Working Capital
is $1,000 more than the amount determined by Buyer, and Buyer contests only
$500 of the amount claimed by Seller, and if the Neutral Auditor ultimately
resolves the dispute by awarding Seller $300 of the $500 contested, then the
costs and expenses of the Neutral Auditor will be allocated 60% (i.e.,
300/500) to Buyer and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to Seller.

 



 

(e) If:

 



 

(i) the Final Closing Net Working Capital is (A) greater than the Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital, Buyer shall pay the difference in cash to Seller
or (B) less than the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, Seller shall pay
the difference in cash to Buyer (the payments contemplated by this _Section
1.5(e)(i)_, the " _Net Working Capital Adjustment_ ");

 



 

(ii) the Final Closing Date Cash is (A) greater than the Estimated Closing
Date Cash, Buyer shall pay the difference in cash to Seller or (B) less than
the Estimated Closing Date Cash, Seller shall pay the difference in cash to
Buyer;

 



 

(iii) the Final Closing Date Indebtedness is (A) less than the Estimated
Closing Date Indebtedness, Buyer shall pay the difference in cash to Seller or
(B) greater than the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, Seller shall pay the
difference in cash to Buyer; and

 



 

(iv) the Final Transaction Expenses are (A) less than the Estimated
Transaction Expenses, Buyer shall pay the difference in cash to Seller or (B)
greater than the Estimated Transaction Expenses, Seller shall pay the
difference in cash to Buyer.

 



 

The net amount of the payments made pursuant to this _Section 1.5(e)_ shall
be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the account(s)
specified in writing by the applicable Party, within three (3) Business Days
after the determination of the Final Closing Net Working Capital, the Final
Closing Date Cash, the Final Closing Date Indebtedness, and the Final
Transaction Expenses.

 



 

Section 1.6 _Tax Treatment; Purchase Price Allocation_. Buyer and Seller shall
allocate the Purchase Price (and all other amounts treated as consideration
for income Tax purposes) among the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
which allocation shall be in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Allocation_ "). No later
than ninety (90) days after the Purchase Price is finally determined
hereunder, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a proposed Allocation (" _Buyer s
Allocation_") for its review and comment. If Seller does not provide any
comments to Buyer in writing on or before the thirtieth (30th) day after Buyer
delivers to Seller Buyers Allocation, then Buyers Allocation shall be deemed
to be final and binding, absent manifest error. If, however, Seller submits
written comments to Buyer, notifying Buyer of any objection in reasonable
detail on or before

 



      
 

 



 

the thirtieth (30th) day after Buyer delivers to Seller Buyers Allocation,
Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any differences
within thirty (30) days. If Seller and Buyer have agreed on the Allocation
within either thirty (30) day period, then Buyer and Seller shall (and shall
cause their respective Affiliates) to (a) report, act and file Tax Returns in
all respects and for all purposes consistent with such Allocation, and (b) not
take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with such allocation, except to the extent otherwise required
pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code (or any analogous provision of state, local or foreign law). If Buyer and
Seller are unable to resolve any such disagreement within such thirty (30) day
period, then each of Buyer and Seller shall use its own allocation. Each party
shall provide the other promptly with any other information required to
complete Internal Revenue Service Form 8594.

 



 

Section 1.7 _Excluded Liabilities_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer is not
acquiring the liabilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are
listed on _Schedule 1.7_ (collectively, the " _Excluded Liabilities_ "). The
Excluded Liabilities shall be retained by Seller and its Affiliates and, to
the extent applicable, transferred to Seller or its Affiliates by the Company
prior to the Closing. Any Taxes incurred by or assessed against the Company as
a result of such transfer of Excluded Liabilities will also be considered
Excluded Liabilities.

 



 

Section 1.8 _Withholding_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such payment under all
applicable Tax laws. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

liability (i) to a Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial
withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, as those
terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (ii) under
Title IV of ERISA or Section 302 of ERISA or Sections 412 or 430 of the Code

(g) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have been asserted or
instituted, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no set of circumstances
exists which may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries
thereof with respect to their duties to the Company Benefit Plans or the
assets of any of the trusts under any of the Company Benefit Plans which would
reasonably be expected to result in any material liability to the Company or
any of its ERISA Affiliates or any Company Benefit Plan. There are no
nonexempt prohibited transactions under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan. None of Seller, the Company, any of the

Code relating to any of the Company Benefit Plans, and no event, transaction
or condition has occurred or exists that would reasonably be expected to
result in any such material liability to the

 



      
 

 



 

Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates or, after the Closing, Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the performance
by Seller of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions

will accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due any current or former director, consultant officer or
employee under any of the Company Benefit Plans, (ii) entitle any current or
former employee, director, consultant or officer to severance pay, (iii)
trigger any funding obligation under any Company Benefit Plan or impose any

material Third-Party Consents, giving such notices, and making such filings;
_provided_ , _however_ , the Parties acknowledge and agree that it shall not

commercially reasonable best efforts, some or all of the Third-Party Consents
are not obtained.

 



 

(c) _Failure to Obtain Third-Party Consents_. Buyer acknowledges that (i)

and that such Third-Party Consents have not been obtained as of the date
hereof and may not be obtained prior to or at Closing.

its possession relating to the Company as Buyer may reasonably request (which
shall include uninterrupted access to the materials provided to Buyer through
the Merrill Datasite virtual dataroom in connection with Buyers due diligence
of the Business and the Units prior to the date hereof); _provided_ that Buyer
and its representatives shall take such action as is deemed necessary in the

a representative designated by Seller and in such a way as to avoid disrupting
in any material respect the normal business of the Company; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not require Seller or the Company to
disclose any privileged information of Seller, the Company or its
Subsidiaries. All such information and documents obtained by Buyer shall be

the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and the terms and conditions
of that certain Clean Team Confidentiality Agreement, dated January 28, 2017,

Agreement_ " and together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the "
_Confidentiality Agreements_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
_Section 6.4_ shall require Seller to disclose any of Sellers books and
records to the extent not relating to the Business. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Buyer shall have no right of
access to, and Seller and the Company shall have no obligation to provide to
Buyer, information relating to any information, the disclosure of which would
result in a violation of applicable law.

Date, Seller shall keep all documents, materials, records and other
information that it has or has obtained prior to or after the Closing
regarding the Company and the Business (" _Confidential Information_ ")
strictly confidential and will not disclose such information without Buyers
prior written consent, other than as required by applicable law; _provided_ ,
that if Seller is required by applicable law to disclose Confidential
Information, then it shall disclose only that portion of such information that
is legally required to be disclosed and (to the extent permitted by applicable
law) provide advance notice to Buyer of such disclosure to the extent
reasonably practicable and provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to
seek, at the Companys expense, a protective order or other remedy and to
reasonably cooperate with the seeking of such protective order or other
remedy. Confidential Information shall not include information that (i) is or
becomes publicly available (other than as a result of a disclosure in
violation of this _Section 6.5(b)_), (ii) is or becomes available to Seller
(other than by or with respect to the Company) after the date hereof from a
source that is not prohibited from disclosing such information to Seller or
its Affiliates by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation or (iii) has

with respect to the Company) after the date hereof without reference to
Confidential Information.

securities exchange and (ii) that each of Buyer and Seller may issue a press
release describing the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC attaching this
Agreement and the press release as exhibits to such filing, and in each case
of (i) and (ii) the other Party shall have the right to reasonably review and
comment on such press release, announcement or Form 8-K prior to its
publication or filing.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) From the Signing Date until the Closing, without the prior written consent
of Buyer (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), none of Seller, the Company or any Subsidiaries of the Company shall
make or change any election, change an annual accounting period, file any
amended Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement, settle any Tax claim or
assessment relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, surrender any
right to claim a refund of Taxes or consent to any extension or waiver of the
limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, if such election, adoption, change,
amendment, agreement, settlement, surrender or consent would have the effect
of increasing the Tax liability of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or
Buyer.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall have the right, at Buyers sole expense, to structure all or
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a simultaneous or
deferred (reverse) exchange allowed pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (a " _Like-Kind Exchange_ ");
_provided_ that any such Like-Kind Exchange would not materially delay,
prohibit, prevent or restrict the Closing. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement, in connection with effectuating a Like-Kind
Exchange, Buyer shall

 



       
 

 



 

have the right, at or prior to the Closing Date and at Buyers sole expense,
to assign all or a portion of its rights under this Agreement (the " _Assigned
Rights_ ") to a "qualified intermediary" (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)), a "qualified exchange accommodation
titleholder" (within the meaning of Revenue Procedure 2000-37), or another
person reasonably selected by Buyer for the purpose of satisfying the
requirements of Section 1031 of the Code (each, an " _Accommodator_ "). In the
event Buyer assigns the Assigned Rights to an Accommodator pursuant to this
_Section 6.7(b)_, then Buyer agrees to notify Seller in writing of such
assignment reasonably in advance of the Closing Date. In addition, should
Buyer choose to effectuate a Like-Kind Exchange, the Parties agree to
cooperate with one another in the completion of such an exchange, including
the execution of all documents reasonably necessary to effectuate such a Like-
Kind Exchange. For the avoidance of doubt, the cost to the Parties in respect
of drafting, reviewing and executing such documentation shall be Buyers sole
expense. Each of Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that any assignment of
the Assigned Rights pursuant to this _Section 6.7(b)_ shall not release a
Party from, or modify, any of its respective liabilities and obligations
(including indemnity obligations to each other) under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.8 _No Solicitation of Other Bids_. Seller and the Company shall not,
and shall not authorize or permit any of their respective Affiliates or any of
their respective representatives to, directly or indirectly, (a) encourage,
solicit, initiate, facilitate or continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition
Proposal; (b) enter into discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
information to, any Person concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal; or (c)
enter into any agreements or other instruments (whether or not binding)
regarding an Acquisition Proposal. Seller and the Company shall immediately
cease and cause to be terminated, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
and all of their respective representatives to immediately cease and cause to
be terminated, all existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons
conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal. Seller and the Company will promptly notify Buyer in the event that
Seller or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or any of their
respective representatives receive any request for information or proposal
relating to a potential Acquisition Proposal. For purposes hereof, "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
(other than Buyer or any of its Affiliates) relating to the direct or indirect
disposition, whether by sale, merger or otherwise, of all or any portion of
the Units or, except as permitted by _Section 6.3_ the assets of the Company.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Intercompany Accounts_. At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall
cause all intercompany accounts involving Seller or any of its Affiliates

Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, to be settled.

out in full all equipment leases used by the Business, all of which are listed

which are listed on _Schedule 6.10_, which Buyer shall assume at Closing.

Indemnified Parties does for itself, himself or herself release and absolutely
forever discharge Seller and its officers, managers, directors,

release contained in this _Section 6.12_ shall be effective as a full and
final accord and satisfaction and general release of and from all Seller

executed and delivered by Buyer Parent pursuant hereto, and the performance of
Buyer Parents obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by Buyer Parent and, assuming that this Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the party seeking to enforce the Agreement, this
Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Buyer Parent,
enforceable against Buyer Parent in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforcement may be limited by laws affecting the enforcement of creditors
rights generally or by general equitable principles; (ii) the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Buyer Parent, and the other documents and
instruments to be executed and delivered by Buyer Parent pursuant hereto, and
the performance of Buyer Parents obligations hereunder and thereunder will
not result in (i) any breach or violation of or default under any law,
statute, regulation, judgment, or other Governmental Authorization or any
mortgage, lease, agreement, deed of trust, indenture or any other instrument
to which Buyer Parent is a party or by which Buyer Parent or any of Buyer
Parents properties or assets are bound, or (ii) the creation or imposition of
any Liens on any of the Units, except in both cases for any breach, violation,
default or Lien that would not reasonably be expected to interfere in any
material respect with the performance by Buyer Parent of Buyer Parents

 



      
 

 



 

obligations hereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Buyer Parent understands and acknowledges that the Seller and
the Company are entering into this Agreement in reliance upon Buyer Parents
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance by Buyer Parent
of its obligations under this _Section 6.15_.

 



 

(c) In the event Buyer Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Buyer Parent shall assume all of the obligations
set forth in this _Section 6.15_.

 



 

Section 6.16 _Employees and Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) _Post-Closing Compensation and Benefits_. Buyer agrees that during the
period commencing upon the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Continuing Employees shall be provided with (1) base
salary or base wage that is no less favorable than the base salary or base
wage provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to each such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, (2) target annual cash bonus
opportunities that are no less favorable than the target annual cash bonus
opportunities provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to each such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall exclude any equity and long-term incentive
compensation that such employees may be eligible to receive pursuant to the
Seller LTIP or otherwise), (3) pension and welfare benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided to similarly situated employees
of Buyer and (4) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the
severance benefits provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) _Past Service Credit_. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
provide each Continuing Employee with service credit, for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting, seniority and benefit accrual (including,
without limitation, with respect to vacation, severance and service awards),
under any benefit plan or program sponsored by Buyer or its Affiliates (each,
a " _Buyer Benefit_ _Plan_ ") in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to
participate, for all periods of employment with the Company prior to the
Closing Date for which service was recognized by the Company immediately prior
to the Closing Date (other than with respect to any newly adopted Buyer
Benefit Plan for which past service credit is not granted to participants
generally); _provided_ , that such service shall not be recognized for
purposes of (i) any defined benefit retirement plan, (ii) any Buyer Benefit
Plan that is a frozen plan, (iii) retiree welfare benefits, or (iv) to the
extent such recognition would result in duplication of benefits for the same
period of service.

 



 

(c) _Bonus Payments_. Seller shall assume and retain (and be liable for the
payment of) all liability for (i) the "AUSA Bonus Program" covering salaried
employees of the Company set forth in _Schedule 6.16(c)_ and (ii) the safe
work performance bonus program (collectively, the " _Bonus Programs_ "). On
the Closing Date, Seller shall pay each bonus-eligible Continuing Employee a
pro-rata portion of the cash bonus to which he or she would otherwise be
entitled to receive under the Bonus Programs in respect of the calendar year
in which the Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Date occurs, for that portion of the calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs that has elapsed through the day immediately prior to the Closing Date,
based on the target percentage of Sellers proscribed formula for calculating
bonuses for those pro rata periods of service under the Bonus Programs.

 



 

(d) _Defined Contribution Plans._ If requested by Buyer not less than five (5)
Business Days before the Closing Date, the Company shall adopt resolutions and
take such corporate action as Buyer may request to amend or terminate the
Qualified Plans that are intended to be tax-qualified defined contribution
plans and sponsored by Company or any of its Subsidiaries, effective as of no
later than the day prior to the Closing Date. The form and substance of such
resolutions and any other actions taken in connection with the foregoing
sentence shall be subject to the review and approval of Buyer, not to be
unreasonably withheld. If Buyer requests that the Company amend or terminate
the Qualified Plans in accordance with the first sentence of this _Section
6.16(d)_, then prior to the Closing Date, the Company and Buyer shall take any
and all actions as may be required, including, to the extent that Buyer
requests that the Company terminate the Qualified Plans, amendments to the
tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan designated by Buyer (the "
_Buyer 401(k) Plan_") to permit each Continuing Employee to make rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the form of cash in an amount equal to the
full account balance distributed or distributable to such Continuing Employee
from the applicable Qualified Plan to the Buyer 401(k) Plan. Each Continuing
Employee shall become a participant in the Buyer 401(k) Plan as soon as
administratively practicable following the Closing Date (giving effect to the
service crediting provisions of _Section 6.16(b)_); it being agreed that the
parties shall cooperate in good faith to minimize or eliminate any gap in
participation in a tax-qualified defined contribution plan.

 



 

(e) _COBRA_. Buyer shall be solely responsible and liability for providing, or
continuing to provide, heath care continuation coverage as required under
COBRA with respect to any individual who experiences a COBRA "qualifying
event" in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(excluding the Seller Retained Employees).

 



 

(f) _Liabilities with respect to AUSA Holding Company-Level Employees_.
Effective prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall assume and remain solely
liable for any and all liabilities and obligations with respect to the Seller
Retained Employees (whether arising under the Company Benefit Plans or
otherwise), which shall be considered Excluded Liabilities.

 



 

(g) _No Third Party Rights or Amendment to Benefit Plans_. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed to grant any employee or Continuing Employee a
right to continued employment by, or to receive any payments or benefits from,
Buyer or Company or their respective Affiliates or through any employee
benefit plan. This Agreement shall not limit Buyers or and of its Affiliates
ability or right to amend or terminate any benefit or compensation plan or
program of Buyer or its Affiliates and nothing contained herein shall be
construed as an amendment to or modification of any such plan. This _Section
6.16_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party to
this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.16_, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any other Person, including, any current or former
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates, any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
_Section 6.16_.

cured, such breach has not been cured by Seller or the Company, as the case
may be, within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from Buyer;

 



 

(iii) by Seller or the Company if there has been a material breach by Buyer of

or concurrently with such termination in the event of a termination by Buyer
or (y) no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following such termination

respect to, and solely with respect to, those claims made by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties by delivery of a proper notice of such claims in
accordance with this _Article IX_ to Seller before the expiration of the

the amount of the aggregate Purchase Price paid by Buyer (other than for
Losses as a result of or involving fraud).

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, Buyer will
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates, officers, directors,

Seller Indemnified Parties be entitled to recover pursuant to _Section

Purchase Price paid by Buyer (other than for Losses as a result of or
involving fraud).

 



 

Section 9.4 _Procedure for Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) _Third-Party Claims_. Promptly (but in no event more than twenty (20)
days) after receipt by a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party
(an " _Indemnified Party_ ") under _Section_ 9.2 or _Section 9.3_ of written
notice of the commencement of any third party claim against it (" _Third-Party
Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party will, if a claim is to be made by such
Indemnified Party against a party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") under
_Section 9.2_ or

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 9.3_, give notice to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement of
such Third-Party Claim, but the failure to notify the Indemnifying Party will
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to any
Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the defense of such action is
prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice. Thereafter,
the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly
following receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including
court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to such Third-Party
Claim. If any such Third-Party Claim is brought against an Indemnified Party
and it gives notice to the Indemnifying Party of such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in such Third-Party Claim
and, to the extent that it wishes, to assume the defense of such Third-Party
Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and, after
notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not,
as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified
Party under this _Article IX_ for any fees of other counsel or any other
expenses with respect to the defense of such Third-Party Claim, in each case
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
of such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the Indemnified
Partys prior written consent, settle or compromise any Proceeding or consent
to the entry of any judgment with respect to any Third-Party Claim unless such
settlement, compromise or judgment includes as an unconditional term thereof
the release by the claimant or the plaintiff of the Indemnified Party from all
liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim. In no event shall an
Indemnified Party consent to the entry of judgment or enter into any
compromise or settlement with respect to a Third-Party Claim for which it is
seeking or will seek indemnification without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(b) _Other Claims_. A claim for indemnification for any Losses not involving a
Third-Party Claim may be asserted by notice to the Party from whom
indemnification is sought. Such notice shall be provided to the Indemnifying
Party within thirty (30) days of the date on which the Indemnified Party first
incurs or becomes aware that it may incur such Losses. If the Indemnifying
Party disputes its liability with respect to such claim, the parties shall
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute prior to
pursuing other remedies.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Other Matters_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes
of the parties indemnification obligations under this _Article IX_ all of
the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement that are
qualified as to "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect," or words of similar
import or effect shall be deemed to have been made without any such
qualification for purposes of determining (i) whether a breach of any such
representation or warranty has occurred, and (ii) the amount of Losses arising
out of or relating to any such breach of representation or warranty.

 



 

(b) Each Indemnified Party shall make commercially reasonably efforts to
mitigate any Losses that an Indemnified Party asserts under this _Article
IX_. In the event that an Indemnified Party shall fail to make such
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any such Losses, then
notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, the
Indemnifying

 



      
 

 



 

Party shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnified Party for any Loss
that could reasonably be expected to have been avoided if the Indemnified
Party had made such efforts.

 



 

(c) Any claim for indemnification under this Agreement shall, to the extent
practicable, describe the claim in reasonable detail and indicate the
estimated amount of such claim.

 



 

(d) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
_Article IX_ shall be reduced by any net Tax benefit actually realized by the
Indemnified Party from the incurrence or payment of any such Losses, and shall
be increased by any Tax costs arising from the receipt or accrual by the
Indemnified Party of any such indemnification payment, subject to _Section
9.5(e)_.

 



 

(e) Any indemnification payable under this _Article IX_ and any payment made
pursuant to _Section 1.5_ shall, to the extent permitted by law, be treated
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have no right to indemnification under
_Section 9.2(a)_ with respect to any Losses if the matter forming the basis
for such Losses shall have been expressly taken into account in the
determination of the Final Closing Net Working Capital, the Final Transaction
Expenses, the Final Closing Date Cash, the Final Closing Date Indebtedness or
the Purchase Price, as adjusted.

 



 

Section 9.6 _EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES; WAIVER OF CERTAIN DAMAGES_. FROM AND AFTER
THE CLOSING, THE REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED FOR BY THIS
_ARTICLE IX_, AND _SECTION 11.12_ SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES
OF THE PARTIES FOR THE SUBJECT MATTER PROVIDED THEREIN; _PROVIDED, HOWEVER_ ,
THAT NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT A PARTYS RIGHT TO SEEK SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE
OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER PARTYS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, PUNITIVE,
EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT,
TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE; _PROVIDED_ , _HOWEVER_ , THAT THIS
PROVISION SHALL IN NO WAY LIMIT THE RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES WITH
RESPECT TO ANY SUCH DAMAGES INCLUDED IN ANY THIRD PARTY CLAIM. NO LIMITATION
IN THIS _SECTION 9.6_ SHALL APPLY TO ANY LOSS WITH RESPECT TO, AS A RESULT OF
OR INVOLVING, FRAUD ON THE PART OF SELLER OR THE COMPANY.

survive the Closing, and shall continue in full force and effect for a period
of six (6) years after the Closing Date.

such "tail" insurance policies as of the Closing, at Sellers request, the

insurance and; _provided_ , _further_ that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Company shall obtain a policy with

(d) If after Closing Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any

Section 11.9 _Rules of Construction_.

 



 

(a) All references in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits and Schedules are
references to Sections of, and Exhibits and Schedules to, this Agreement
unless the context otherwise requires. The Schedules and Exhibits attached to
this Agreement constitute a part of this Agreement and are incorporated herein
for all purposes.

 



 

(b) The words " _hereby_ ," " _herein_ ," " _hereof_ ," " _hereunder_ " and
words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole (including any
Exhibits and Schedules hereto) and not merely to the specific section,
paragraph or clause in which such word appears. The words " _include_ ," "
_includes_ " and " _including_ " are deemed to be followed by the phrase "
_without limitation_." The definitions given in this Agreement apply equally
to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined. Whenever the
context requires, any pronoun includes the corresponding masculine, feminine
and neuter forms. If a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a noun),
it shall have a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech
(such as a verb).

 



 

(c) Each Party acknowledges that such Party and its attorney(s) have reviewed
this Agreement and that any rule of construction to the effect that any
ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party, or any similar rule
operating against the drafter of an agreement, shall not be applicable to the
construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) The section headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference
only and will not be deemed to alter or affect the meaning or interpretation
of any provision hereof.

 



 

(e) All references to currency herein shall be to, and all payments required
hereunder shall be paid in, US dollars.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 11.10 _Governing Law; JURY WAIVER_.

 



 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE CONSTRUED, PERFORMED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW
PRINCIPLES OF SUCH STATE THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF ANOTHER
STATE TO APPLY.

 



 

(b) THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE THAT THEY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION TO ENFORCE OR INTERPRET THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT.

 



 

Section 11.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction and Forum Selection_. EACH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE
OF DELAWARE AND THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT THEREIN IN CONNECTION WITH
ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY.

 



 

Section 11.12 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, the Parties agree that, in addition to any other
remedies, each Party shall be entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement
by a decree of specific performance without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy of money damages as a remedy. Each Party hereby waives any
requirement for securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy. Each Party further agrees that the only permitted objection that it
may raise in response to any action for equitable relief is that it contests
the existence of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.13 _Disclosure Schedules_. The schedules to this Agreement are
arranged in sections corresponding to those contained in this Agreement merely
for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section or subsection of
such schedules as an exception to any particular covenant, representation or
warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to
all other covenants, representations or warranties, notwithstanding the
presence or absence of an appropriate section or subsection of such schedules
with respect to such other covenants, representations or warranties or an
appropriate cross-reference thereto, in each case to the extent relevancy of
such disclosure to such other covenants, representations or warranties is
reasonably apparent on its face. Additionally, for each of the schedules, the
mere inclusion of an item in such schedules as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment,
in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in
such schedules, that such information is required to be listed in such
schedules or that such item (or any non-disclosed item or information of
comparable or greater significance) represents a material exception or fact,
event or circumstance, that such item has had, or is expected to result in, a
Material Adverse Effect that such item actually constitutes noncompliance
with, or a violation of, any law, Governmental Authorization or Contract or
other topic to which such disclosure is applicable or that such item is
outside the ordinary course of business; furthermore, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the mere inclusion of a Contract on _Schedule
3.9(a)_ does not mean that such Contract is a Material Contract. The

 



      
 

 



 

specification of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the
Disclosure Schedules is not intended to imply that such amounts (or higher or
lower amounts) are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the
setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the
Disclosure Schedules in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in a
Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.
Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules, unless otherwise defined
therein, shall have the meanings assigned to them in this Agreement.
