NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual

which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally
bound, agree as follows:

 

 _ARTICLE I_



 

 _DEFINITIONS; INTERPRETATION_

 

Section 1.1 _Definitions Generally_. Defined terms in this Agreement and in
the Appendices and Schedules to this Agreement, which may be identified by
the  capitalization of the first letter of each principal word thereof, have the
meanings assigned to them in Appendix A to this Agreement. Other terms may be
defined elsewhere in the text of this Agreement and, unless otherwise
indicated, shall have such meaning throughout this Agreement and the
Appendices and Schedules hereto.

 

Section 1.2 _Interpretation Generally_.

 

Unless the express context otherwise requires:

 

(a) the words "hereof," "herein," and "hereunder" and words of similar import,
when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement;

(b) the terms defined in the singular have a comparable meaning when used in
the plural, and vice versa;

(c) references herein to a specific Article, Section, Subsection or
Schedule shall refer, respectively, to Articles, Sections, Subsections or
Schedules of this Agreement;

(d) wherever the word "include," "includes," or "including" is used in this
Agreement, it shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation;"

 

(e) references herein to any gender includes each other gender;

 

(f) the word "or" shall be inclusive and not exclusive (for example, the
phrase "A or B" means "A or B or both," not "either A or B but not both"),
unless used in conjunction with "either" or the like;

(g) each reference to "days" shall be to calendar days;

(h) each reference to any Contract shall be to such Contract as amended,
supplemented, waived or otherwise modified from time to time;

(i) each reference to a Law, statute, regulation or other government rule is
to it as amended from time to time and, as applicable, is to corresponding
provisions of successor Laws, statutes, regulations or other government rules;

 

(j) accounting terms which are not otherwise defined in this Agreement, or any
Appendix or Schedule hereto, shall have the meanings given to them under
GAAP;

(k) any payments or release of funds from the Merger Consideration Escrow
Account or General Escrow Account to Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified Party (or
any of their respective designees) shall be deemed to be a payment made by the
Stockholders Representative and/or one or more of the Stockholders;

 



2 (l) all references herein to the Company, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation shall mean, with respect to any time at or after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation;

(m) the phrase "made available to Buyer" or similar phrases shall mean that
the subject documents were either posted to the "Project Open Eagle" data room
at Intralinks or delivered to Buyer or its accountants or attorneys prior to
5:00 p.m. EDT on the date immediately preceding this Agreement; and

(n) each representation, warranty and covenant contained herein will have
independent significance. If any party has breached or violated, or if there
is an inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein
in any respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or
covenant related to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity), which the party has not breached or violated, or in
respect of which there is not an inaccuracy, will not detract from or mitigate
the fact that the party has breached or violated, or there is an
inaccuracy in, the first representation, warranty or covenant.

_ARTICLE II_

 _COMPANY; POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS_

Section 2.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall file with

provisions of the DGCL and the Company shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger (including,
if applicable, the filing of the amended certificate of incorporation of the

259 of the DGCL.

Section 2.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The certificate of

or by applicable Law. The bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

indemnifiable by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement (including _Section 6.2_
and _Section 12.7_)) (the " _Estimated Transaction Related Expenses_ "), and
the components thereof. If the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than

immediately prior to the Closing (such holders of shares of Common Stock and
Company Stock Options, collectively, the " _Fully Diluted Common Holders_ ")
shall be an amount (the " _Aggregate Common Equity Amount_ ") in Dollars equal
to (i) Five Hundred and Seventy Five Million Dollars ($575,000,000) (the "
_Base Enterprise Value_ "), _plus_ (ii) the Estimated Net Working Capital

Subsidiarys) standard withholding and payroll practices and procedures to
the Person identified by the Stockholders Representative on the Compensatory

5 (e) _Distributions of Closing Payments_.

 

(i) Subject to _Section 2.8(e)(ii)_, the Stockholders Representative shall
distribute in cash the Aggregate Common Equity Amount (other than any portion
of such amount identified by the Stockholders Representative as a
Compensatory Payment in accordance with _Section 2.8(d)_) to the Fully
Diluted Common Holders pursuant to  _Section 2.9(c)_, and _Section 2.9(d)_,
and in accordance with the Companys Certificate of Incorporation (the "
_Certificate of Incorporation_ "), in each case, to each holder of
certificates representing Company Stock (other than Treasury Stock), or
Company Stock Options, as applicable, who has surrendered to the Stockholders
Representative his or its certificates representing the number of shares of
each class of Company Stock held by such holder, together with, in the case
of any Stockholder that is not a party hereto, a duly executed and completed
letter of transmittal or similar documentation, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Stockholders Representative. Surrendered
certificates shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered and exchanged,
each such certificate shall represent solely the right to receive the portion
of the Merger Consideration into which the shares it theretofore
represented shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.9_ and the
rights to receive any payments distributable to the applicable Fully Diluted
Common Holders after the Closing Date, if any, pursuant to this Agreement
(including  _Section 2.11_, _Section 2.12_, _Section 2.13_, _Section
8.6_, and _Article X_ ) or the Escrow Agreement and, other than the foregoing,
each such Stockholder and holder of Company Stock Options shall cease to have
any rights with respect to any Company Stock held by such Stockholder.

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of such fact
by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
together with an indemnity against any claim that may be made against Buyer
or the Surviving Corporation arising from the replacement of such certificate,
the Stockholders Representative shall deliver, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, the portion of the Merger Consideration
to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Stock represented by such
certificate, as contemplated by _Section 2.9_ and the rights to receive any
payments distributable to such Stockholders after the Closing Date, if any,
pursuant to this Agreement (including _Section 2.11_, _Section 2.12_,
_Section 2.13_, _Section 8.6_, and _Article X_ ) or the Escrow Agreement.

 

Section 2.9 _Effect on Company Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Buyer,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Stockholders, the Stockholders
Representative or the holders of any shares of capital stock of Buyer or
Merger Sub:

 



6 (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.9(c)_, all
shares of Company Stock that are owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (" _Treasury Stock_ ") shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist without any
conversion thereof or payment therefor.

 

(c) _Common Stock_. Subject to the terms of _Section 2.8(e)_, each issued and
outstanding share of Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any shares of Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with
_Section 2.9(b)_ and other than Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into and
represent the right to receive an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest
cent), without interest, equal to the Common Stock Conversion Amount.

(d) _Company Stock Options_. Subject to the terms of _Section 2.8(e)_, each
issued and outstanding Company Stock Option whether or not exercisable by the
holder thereof prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and converted
into and represent the right to receive an amount of cash (rounded to the
nearest cent), without interest and subject to applicable withholding tax,
equal to the difference between (i) the product of (x) the Common Stock
Conversion Amount and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock for which such
Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to its cancellation
pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ and (ii) the aggregate exercise price payable
upon exercise of such Company Stock Option in full.

 

(e) _No Further Rights_. At the Effective Time, all Company Stock and Company
Stock Options shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired, and each holder of any shares of Common Stock, or
Company Stock Options shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the respective consideration provided for in
this  _Section 2.9_ and the right to receive any payments distributable to
such holders after the Closing Date, if any, pursuant to this Agreement
(including _Section 2.11_, _Section 2.12_, _Section 2.13_,  _Section
8.6_, and _Article X_ ) or the Escrow Agreement, which in no event shall ever
exceed the Aggregate Common Equity Amount. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and no transfer of any Company
Stock shall be made thereafter. If, after the Effective Time, certificates or
any other evidence of any Company Stock are presented to the Stockholders
Representative, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
respective consideration provided for in this _Section 2.9_ by the
Stockholders Representative and the rights to receive any payments
distributable to such Stockholders after the Closing Date, if any, pursuant to
this Agreement (including  _Section 2.11_, _Section 2.12_, _Section 2.13_,
_Section 8.6_5, and _Article X_ ) or the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Article II_ , none of Buyer, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the
Stockholders Representative, any Stockholder or any holder of Company Stock
Options shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

 



7 Section 2.10 _Appraisal Rights_. Each Stockholder party to this Agreement
hereby irrevocably waives all rights to appraisal under Section 262\.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common
Stock (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by any Person not a party to this Agreement,
who is entitled to demand, and who properly demands, appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive any portion of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
2.9(c)_ and the rights to receive any payments distributable to Fully Diluted
Common Holders after the Closing Date, if any, pursuant to this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement, but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be
entitled to payment of the fair market value of such Appraisal Shares in
accordance with Section 262\. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value
of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders
Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have
been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable
solely for the right to receive, the portion of the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 2.9(c)_ and the rights to receive any payments
distributable to Fully Diluted Common Holders after the Closing Date, if any,
pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

Section 2.11 _Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable, but in any case no later than sixty (60)
calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Stockholders Representative a statement (the " _Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth the Net Working Capital, the Net Funded
Indebtedness, the Transaction Related Expenses (to the extent not paid by the
Company or any of its Affiliates prior to the Closing) (except for any such
Transaction Related Expenses reimbursable or indemnifiable by Buyer pursuant
to this Agreement (including _Section 6.2_ and _Section 12.7_)) and
the components thereof. The Closing Statement shall include the amount
calculated in good faith by Buyer, if any, of the Merger Consideration Escrow
Amount that need not be retained by the Escrow Agent pending resolution of
payments to be made pursuant to Section 2.11(d) (the " _Merger Consideration
Escrow Release Amount_ "). The Merger Consideration Escrow Release Amount, to
the extent there is such an amount, shall be released two (2) Business Days
following Buyers delivery of the Closing Statement. The Closing Statement
and the Net Working Capital, the Net Funded Indebtedness and the Transaction
Related Expenses (to the extent not paid by the Company or any of its
Affiliates prior to the Closing) (except for any such Transaction Related
Expenses reimbursable or indemnifiable by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement
(including _Section 6.2_

 



8  and _Section 12.7_)) calculations shall be prepared and calculated in good
faith, and in the manner and on a basis consistent with the Accounting
Principles (to the extent applicable) and shall be in the same form and
include the same line items as the Estimated Net Working Capital calculation,
the Estimated Net Funded Indebtedness calculation and the Estimated
Transaction Related Expenses calculation. If the Closing Statement is not so
timely delivered, the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Estimated Net Funded
Indebtedness and the Estimated Transaction Related Expenses will be deemed
Final Net Working Capital, Final Net Funded Indebtedness and Final Transaction
Related Expenses, respectively.

(b) After receipt of the Closing Statement, the Stockholders Representative
will have forty five (45) calendar days to review the Closing Statement.
Unless the Stockholders Representative delivers written notice (which notice
shall include the items and amounts in dispute and supporting documentation
related thereto; such notice, a " _Seller Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer setting
forth the items disputed by the Stockholders Representative with respect
thereto on or prior to the forty-fifth (45th) calendar day after the
Stockholders Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement, the
Stockholders Representative will be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the
Closing Statement and such statement (and the calculations contained therein)
will be final, binding and conclusive, absent manifest error or fraud. If the
Stockholders Representative notifies Buyer of its objections to items
contained in the Closing Statement (or calculations contained therein) within
such forty five (45) calendar day period, Buyer and the Stockholders
Representative shall, during the thirty (30) calendar days following delivery
of such notice by the Stockholders Representative to Buyer (or such longer
period as they may mutually agree in writing) (the " _Resolution Period_ "),
attempt in good faith to resolve their differences with respect to the
disputed items (or calculations) such notice (the " _Disputed Items_ "), and
all other items (and all calculations relating thereto) will be final,
binding and conclusive, absent manifest error or fraud. Any resolution by
Buyer and the Stockholders Representative during the Resolution Period as to
any Disputed Item shall be set forth in writing and will be final, binding
and conclusive, absent manifest error or fraud.

(c) If Buyer and the Stockholders Representative do not resolve all Disputed
Items by the end of the Resolution Period, then all Disputed Items remaining
in dispute will be submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator. The Neutral Arbitrator
shall act as an arbitrator to determine only those Disputed Items remaining
in dispute, consistent with this _Section 2.11_, and shall request a
statement from Buyer and the Stockholders Representative regarding such
Disputed Items. The scope of the disputes to be arbitrated by the
Neutral Arbitrator is limited to those items or calculations specifically in
dispute between Buyer and the Stockholders Representative; and the Neutral
Arbitrator is not to make any other determination. In resolving each Disputed
Item, the Neutral Arbitrator shall be bound by the principles set forth in
this _Section 2.11_ and may not assign a value to any Disputed Item greater
than the greatest value for such Disputed Item claimed by any party or less
than the lowest value for such Disputed Item claimed by any party. The
parties further agree that the adjustment contemplated by this _Section 2.11_
is intended to show the change between the Estimated Net Working Capital and
the Final Net Working Capital, the change between the Estimated Net Funded
Indebtedness and the Final Net

 



9  Funded Indebtedness and the change between Estimated Transaction Related
Expenses and Final Transaction Related Expenses, and that such changes can
only be measured if each calculation is done in a manner consistent with the
Accounting Principles and the definitions thereof. All fees and expenses
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Arbitrator will
be allocated between Buyer and the Stockholders Representative (which, in
the case of the Stockholders Representative, shall be payable by the
Stockholders Representative solely out of the Reserve Amount) in the same
proportion that the aggregate amount of the Disputed Items so submitted to
the Neutral Arbitrator that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as
finally determined by the Neutral Arbitrator) bears to the total amount of
such Disputed Items so submitted. The Neutral Arbitrator will deliver to Buyer
and the Stockholders Representative a written determination (such
determination to include a work sheet setting forth all material calculations
used in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on information
provided to the Neutral Arbitrator by the Stockholders Representative and
Buyer) of the Disputed Items submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator within thirty
(30) calendar days of receipt of such Disputed Items, which determination will
be final, binding and conclusive, absent manifest error or fraud. The final,
binding and conclusive Closing Statement based either upon agreement by the
parties, or deemed agreement by Buyer and the Stockholders Representative in
accordance with this  _Section 2.11_, or the written determination delivered
by the Neutral Arbitrator in accordance with this _Section 2.11(c)_ will be
the "Conclusive Closing Statement." If any party fails to submit a statement
regarding any Disputed Item submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator within the
time determined by the Neutral Arbitrator or otherwise fails to give the
Neutral Arbitrator access as reasonably requested, then the Neutral Arbitrator
shall render a decision based solely on the evidence timely submitted and the
access afforded to the Neutral Arbitrator by the other party. Except in
instances involving fraud or except as may arise out of the representations
and warranties under _Article III_ and  _Article IV_ and in such instances
only to the extent set forth in this Agreement, neither any Stockholder,
holder of Company Stock Options or the Stockholder Representative shall have
any liability with respect to Funded Indebtedness, Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness, Transactions Related Expenses, or current assets or current
liabilities (including as to accounts receivable and the collectability
thereof) or any other component of Net Working Capital except as determined in
this  _Section 2.11_.

(d) Within two (2) Business Days after the Final Amounts have been determined
in accordance with this  _Section 2.11_:

(i) if the Aggregate Common Equity Amount is greater than the Final Payment
Amount, then the Stockholders Representative and Buyer shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to pay to the Surviving Corporation, using first the funds in the
Merger Consideration Escrow Account and, to the extent the funds in the Merger
Consideration Escrow Account are not sufficient to satisfy such payment in
full, then out of the funds in the General Escrow Account, an amount in cash
equal to the amount by which the Aggregate Common Equity Amount is greater
than the Final Payment Amount (as defined below); and

 



10 (ii) if the Aggregate Common Equity Amount is less than the Final Payment
Amount (as defined below), Buyer shall pay, or cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay, to the Stockholders Representative (for further pro rata
distribution to the Fully Diluted Common Holders) an amount in cash equal to
the amount by which the Aggregate Common Equity Amount is less than the Final
Payment Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds (the amount
payable to Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.11(d)(i)_ and the amount payable to
the Stockholders Representative pursuant to this _Section 2.11(d)(ii)_ are
referred to herein as the " _Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount_ ");
_provided_ that any portion of any amount payable under this  _Section
2.11(d)(ii)_ that is a Compensatory Payment shall not be paid to the
Stockholders Representative but shall instead be paid by the Surviving
Corporation (or a Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation) through its
payroll system and in accordance with the Surviving Corporations (or such
Subsidiarys) standard withholding and payroll practices and procedures to the
Person identified in writing by the Stockholders Representative as the Person
to whom such Compensatory Payment is to be made.

Any payment by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Stockholders
Representative (pursuant to the distribution of funds from the Merger
Consideration Escrow Account or the General Escrow Account), as the case may
be, pursuant to this _Section 2.11_ will be treated as an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration for tax purposes. For purposes of this _Section 2.11_:

(A) the " _Final Payment Amount_ " shall be an amount in Dollars equal to (i)
the Base Enterprise Value, _plus_ (ii) the Final Net Working Capital Excess
Amount, if any, _minus_ (iii) the Final Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount,
if any, _minus_ (iv) the Final Net Funded Indebtedness, _minus_ (v) the Final
Transaction Related Expenses, _minus_ (vi) the General Escrow Amount, _minus_
(vii) the Merger Consideration Escrow Amount _minus_ (viii) the Reserve
Amount;

 

(B) the " _Final Net Working Capital Excess Amount_ " shall be the amount by
which Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this _Section
2.11_ is greater than Thirty Five Million Dollars ($35,000,000);

(C) the " _Final Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount_ " shall be the amount
by which Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this _Section
2.11_ is less than Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000);

 

(D) the " _Final Net Funded Indebtedness_ " shall be the Net Funded
Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.11_; and

 



11 (E) the " _Final Transaction Related Expenses_ " shall be the Transaction
Related Expenses (to the extent not paid by the Company or any of its
Affiliates prior to the Closing) (except for any such Transaction Related
Expenses expressly payable by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement (including 
_Section 6.2_)) as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.11_.

(e) Buyer acknowledges that the sole and exclusive remedy of itself, Merger
Sub and the Surviving Corporation to receive payments owed to it under this
_Section 2.11_ shall in no event exceed the aggregate amount of the Merger
Consideration Escrow Amount and shall be recoverable solely from the funds in
the Merger Consideration Escrow Account and that the Merger Consideration
Escrow Amount and funds in the Merger Consideration Escrow Account shall not
be available to satisfy any other claim or obligation hereunder;  _provided_
that if the funds in the Merger Consideration Escrow Account are not
sufficient to satisfy all of the payments to Buyer and Surviving Corporation
pursuant to this _Section 2.11_, the funds in the General Escrow Account
can be used to satisfy such shortfall. Absent manifest error or fraud, in the
event that the funds in the Merger Consideration Escrow Account and General
Escrow Account are insufficient to pay to the Surviving Corporation, Merger
Sub or Buyer any amounts owed to it pursuant to this _Section 2.11_, neither
Buyer, Merger Sub nor the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to collect
any remaining amounts, in respect of the amounts owed to it pursuant to this
_Section 2.11_ not satisfied from the funds in the General Escrow Account or
the Merger Consideration Escrow Account, and neither the Stockholders
Representative, any of the other Stockholders or holders of Company Stock
Options nor any other Person shall have any liability for any such
deficiency.

(f) After the Closing and until the Net Working Capital, the Net Funded
Indebtedness and the Transaction Related Expenses has been determined to be
final in accordance with this _Section 2.11_, Buyer shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries to, provide to the
Stockholders Representative and its Representatives full access to the Books
and Records and to any other information (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law), including work papers of their respective accountants (to the
extent permitted by such accountants), and to any employees and premises
during regular business hours and on reasonable advance notice, to the extent
reasonably necessary for the Stockholders Representative to dispute or object
to all or any part of the Closing Statement, and to prepare materials for
presentation to the Neutral Arbitrator in connection with this _Section
2.11_.

(g) The Stockholders Representative shall cause any amounts that are
received by the Stockholders Representative pursuant to this _Section 2.11_
and that are to be paid to Fully Diluted Common Holders following the Closing
Date to be paid to all Fully Diluted Common Holders on a pro rata basis, with
each Fully Diluted Common Holder deemed to hold such portion of the Fully
Diluted Share Number represented by the sum of (x) the number of shares of
Common Stock held by it as of immediately prior to Closing and (y) the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Company Stock Option
held by it as of immediately prior to Closing (assuming the payment of the
exercise price in cash).

 



12 Section 2.12 _Escrow Amounts_. At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit (i) Fifty
Five Million Dollars ($55,000,000.00) (the " _General Escrow Amount_ ") into
an escrow account (the " _General Escrow Account_ ") and (ii) Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000) (the " _Merger Consideration Escrow Amount_ ") into an
escrow account (the " _Merger Consideration Escrow Account_ "), in each case,
to be established with a mutually agreeable escrow agent (it being understood
and agreed that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. shall be deemed to be mutually
agreeable) (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") to be held by the Escrow Agent, pursuant
to the terms of an escrow agreement in a form to be mutually agreed upon by
the parties , with such customary changes thereto as requested by the Escrow
Agent (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The balance of the General Escrow Amount
shall be held by the Escrow Agent to serve as the sole source of payment
(other than with respect to Losses resulting from Stockholder Indemnifiable
Losses and Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are indemnified
pursuant to the Stockholder Tax Indemnity) for any amount due to any Buyer
Indemnified Party for any claim for Losses (other than Stockholder
Indemnifiable Losses and Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are
indemnified pursuant to the Stockholder Tax Indemnity) for which any Buyer
Indemnified Party is entitled to recovery pursuant to _Article X_. On each of
the dates that fall on the next business day immediately following the date
that is six (6), twelve (12), and eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date,
the Escrow Agent shall automatically distribute to the Stockholders
Representative (for further pro rata distribution to the Fully Diluted Common
Holders) in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, an amount equal to twenty five (25) percent of the then
remaining General Escrow Amount. For purposes of calculating the amount of
such payment, the then remaining General Escrow Amount shall be reduced by the
amount of claims for indemnification as provided in _Section 10.11(b)_. On
the General Survival Date, the Escrow Agent shall automatically distribute to
the Stockholders Representative in accordance with and subject to the terms
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement all amounts then remaining in the
General Escrow Account that are not otherwise reserved for claims for
indemnification as provided in _Section 10.11(b)_.

The Merger Consideration Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent
until the ninetieth (90th) day following the Closing Date to serve, together
with the General Escrow Amount, as the sole source of payment for any amount
due to Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation for any adjustment to
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.11_, at which time the Escrow
Agent shall automatically distribute to the Stockholders Representative in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement all
amounts then remaining in the Merger Consideration Escrow Account, if any;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if on such date any Disputed Items exist and so
long as Buyer is complying with its obligations in _Section 2.11_ and
working in good faith to promptly resolve all such Disputed Items, an amount
of such funds equal to the amount of such Disputed Items shall not be released
from the Merger Consideration Escrow Account until the final determination or
agreement of the Conclusive Closing Statement. The fees and disbursements of
the Escrow Agent incurred pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement shall be borne equally by Buyer and the
Stockholders Representative (which, in the case of the Stockholders
Representative, shall be payable by the Stockholders Representative solely
out of the

 



13  Reserve Amount). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
any distribution (or portion thereof) made from the General Escrow Account or
the Merger Consideration Escrow Account that is a Compensatory Payment shall
not be distributed to the Stockholders Representative but shall instead be
transferred to the Company (or a Subsidiary of the Company) and then promptly
paid by the Company (or such Subsidiary) through its payroll system and in
accordance with the Companys (or such Subsidiarys) standard withholding and
payroll practices and procedures to the Person identified in writing by the
Stockholders Representative as the Person to whom such Compensatory Payment
is to be made.

Section 2.13 _Milestone Payments_.

 

(a) _Methotrexate Milestone Payment_. If the cumulative net sales, determined
in accordance with GAAP, by the Surviving Corporation of Methotrexate 2.5 mg
tablets (" _Methotrexate_ ") during the period commencing on the first
Business Day (the " _Milestone Commencement Day_ " following the Closing Date
and ending on the third anniversary of the Milestone Commencement Day (such
third anniversary, the " _Methotrexate Milestone Measurement Date_ "), shall
equal or exceed Two Hundred and Fifty Five Million Dollars ($255,000,000),
then Buyer shall within five (5) Business Days following the Methotrexate
Milestone Measurement Date, pay, or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, to
the Stockholders Representative (for further pro rata distribution to the
Fully Diluted Common Holders) an amount in cash equal to Twenty Five Million
Dollars ($25,000,000) (the " _Methotrexate Milestone Payment_ ") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds.

 

(b) The right to receive the Methotrexate Milestone Payment under this
Agreement shall not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument and
shall not be assignable or otherwise transferable by the holders of any such
right except (i) to the spouse or descendants of the Person surrendering
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) to a trust for
the benefit of the Persons surrendering shares of Company Common Stock or any
Person named in the preceding clause (i), or (iii) by will or operation of
Law.

Company, the Company shall afford Buyers officers and other authorized

Contracts of the Company and its Subsidiaries during normal business hours
throughout the period prior to the Closing Date and, during such period, the
Company shall make available promptly to Buyer all information concerning the
operations, properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Buyer may reasonably request, provided that the foregoing shall not require
the Company or its Affiliates (i) to disclose any privileged information of
the Company or any of its Affiliates, (ii) to permit any environmental
sampling, testing or other intrusive investigations of the Leased Real
Property or (iii) to take any action that would cause material disruption to
the business of the Company or its Affiliates. The Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to disclose as much information as reasonably
requested by the Buyer and the Buyers officers and other authorized
representatives as possible, without compromising any privilege.

(b) Any such investigation by Buyer or Merger Sub shall not unreasonably
interfere with any of the businesses or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Neither Buyer nor Merger Sub shall, prior to the Closing Date,

except in consultation with the Company and then only with the express prior
approval of the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
All requests for information made pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ shall be
directed to the Person designated by the Company in a notice given to Buyer,

Section 6.2 _Efforts to Consummate; Certain Governmental Matters_.

 

(a) The Company, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall, and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and to cooperate in
obtaining any Regulatory Approvals and

 



37  Non-Governmental Consents required in connection with the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. In
connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Buyer, Merger Sub and the
Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later
than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, duly file with the United
States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice the notification and report form required under the HSR Act with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to
_Section 6.2(b)_, the parties hereby agree to diligently pursue termination
of the waiting periods under the HSR Act or any other Competition/Investment
Law (including promptly responding to any requests for additional
information). Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate
with the other party in such other partys efforts to obtain any Non-
Governmental Consents as are required in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Buyer, Merger Sub and the
Company agree to take commercially reasonable steps to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under the HSR Act or any other
Competition/Investment Law that is asserted by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Merger so as to enable the Merger to occur as expeditiously as
possible, including: (i) the prompt preparation and filing of all forms,
registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the taking of such commercially reasonable
actions as are necessary to obtain any requisite approvals, consents, orders,
exemptions or waivers by any Governmental Entity or any other Person,
including filings pursuant to the HSR Act and any actions necessary to cause
the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act and (ii) using
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the satisfaction of all conditions to
the Closing (other than conditions as to the performance by the other Parties
of their obligations) ( _provided_ , that the Company shall not be obligated
to take any such action unless the taking of such action is expressly
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated in this Agreement), in each case, as may be required in order to
obtain any clearance under the HSR Act or any other Competition/Investment
Law or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order, or other order in any Litigation, which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the consummation of the
Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in
this Agreement shall require Buyer or any of its Affiliates to, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, agree to, any sale, divestiture,
license or other disposition of any products, assets or property of the
Company and its Subsidiaries if such actions reasonably would be expected (i)
to materially and adversely affect the benefits expected to be derived by
Buyer and its Affiliates from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or (ii) be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to agree to any sale,
divestiture, license or other disposition whatsoever of any products, assets
or property of Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Buyer,

Subsidiaries or Buyer and Merger Sub and such other matters as may be
necessary or reasonably advisable in connection with any notices, reports,
statements, applications or other filings made by or on behalf of Buyer, or
the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates to any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements; _provided_ that any such documentation furnished by the
parties to one another may be redacted to the extent necessary, either to
comply with applicable Law or to protect the confidentiality of information
that if furnished would not materially facilitate the other partys
understanding of the status of matters relating to consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, Buyer and the Company may, as
each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other as "outside counsel only." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials or its
legal counsel.

Buyer, Merger Sub, and the Company each shall keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to consummation of the transactions contemplated

or other reason that would prevent the receipt of any Regulatory Approvals or
the Non-Governmental Consents for the timely consummation of transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and (ii) promptly
furnishing the other with copies of material notices or other
communications received by Buyer, Merger Sub, or the Company, as the case may
be, from any third party or any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements;
_provided_ that any such notices furnished by the parties to one another may
be redacted to the extent necessary, either to comply with applicable Law or
to protect the confidentiality of information that if furnished would not
materially facilitate the other partys understanding of the status of
matters relating to consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. None
of Buyer, Merger Sub, or the Company shall permit any of its officers or any
other representatives or agents to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Entity with respect to any filings, investigation or other
inquiry relating to the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults
with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat.

(e) Each of Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company shall (i) respond as promptly
as practicable under the circumstances to any inquiries received from any
Governmental Entity for additional information or documentation and to all
inquiries and

 



39  requests received from any Governmental Entity, (ii) not extend any waiting
period under the HSR Act without the prior written consent of the other party
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and
(iii) not enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity not to
consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(f) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries to, prepare and
file all notices, reports, statements, applications and other filings as
required by applicable Law or any Governmental Entity or as otherwise
customary or advisable under applicable Law as a result of the consummation
on the Closing Date of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(g) Subject to applicable Law and except as required by any Governmental
Entity, none of Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company shall take any action that
would be reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay the receipt of any
Regulatory Approvals or Non-Governmental Consents, in each case, to the
extent necessary for the timely consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including, without limitation,
entering into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with regard to
consummating an acquisition entailing overlapping business products, or
consummate any such acquisition.

47 _ARTICLE VII_

 

 _EMPLOYMENT MATTERS_

 

Section 7.1 _Employee Benefits; 280G Shareholder Approval_.

 

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates or the Surviving
Corporation to, provide employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
who are employed immediately prior to the Closing Date and who continue to be
so employed (" _Continuing Employees_ "), compensation and employee benefits
that, with respect to each Continuing Employee, are substantially similar in
value in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. If the
Continuing Employees participate in any Benefit Plans or employee benefit
plans, agreements, programs, policies and arrangements of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (the " _Buyer Plans_ "), Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
or the Surviving Corporation to use best efforts to, (i) provide coverage for
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under its or their medical,
dental and health plans without interruption of coverage; (ii) cause to be
waived any pre-existing condition, actively at work requirements and waiting
periods (to the extent waived under a comparable Benefit Plan); and (iii)
cause the Buyer Plans to honor any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-
of-pocket expenses incurred by the Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents under similar plans of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
during the calendar year in which such Continuing Employee or eligible
dependent first becomes eligible for coverage under such Buyer Plan for
purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-
pocket expenses. No provision of this Agreement shall create any obligation on
Buyer, its Affiliates or the Surviving Corporation to maintain the employment
of any Continuing Employee after the Closing Date. Nothing herein shall
prevent Buyer, its Affiliates or the Surviving Corporation from terminating
the employment of any Continuing Employee during the Continuation Period in
compliance with applicable Law and _Section 7.1(b)_. No provision of this
Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any Continuing
Employee, or any beneficiary or dependents thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and benefits that may be
provided to any Continuing Employee by Buyer, its Affiliates or the Surviving
Corporation or its subsidiaries or under any benefit plan which Buyer, its
Affiliates or the Surviving Corporation may maintain.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, during the
Continuation Period, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue
to provide severance pay for the benefit of each Continuing Employee that is
no less favorable than the severance pay provided by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in respect of each such Continuing Employee as of the date
hereof, as set forth in _Schedule 7.1(b)_.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use best efforts to obtain a written waiver from each
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code)
with respect to the Company (a " _Disqualified Individual_ ") of his or her
right to that portion of any and all payments or other benefits that such
Disqualified Individual may become entitled to receive in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that could be deemed "parachute
payments" under Section 280G(b) of the Code (determined without regard to
Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code) if such payments are not approved by the
applicable entitys stockholders in a manner that satisfies the requirements
of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) and any regulations thereunder (the " _280G Waived
Amounts_ "). Prior to

 



48  the Closing Date, the Company shall solicit shareholder approval of the 280G
Waived Amounts, if any, in a manner that satisfies the requirements for the
exemption under Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Code and any regulations
issued thereunder, including the provision of adequate disclosure to all
applicable stockholders of all material facts concerning all payments that, in
the absence of such stockholder approval, could be classified as "parachute
payments" to a Disqualified Individual under Section 280G of the Code. The
Company shall provide such adequate disclosure to the applicable stockholders
in a manner that satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and any
regulations issued thereunder. In connection with the foregoing, Buyer shall
provide the Company, no later than four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, with all information and documents necessary to allow the Company to
determine whether any payments made or to be made or benefits granted or to be
granted pursuant to any agreement or arrangement entered into or negotiated by
the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (" _Buyer Payments_ "), together with all
other payments and benefits that any Disqualified Individual may be entitled
to receive or retain that are treated as being "contingent" (within the
meaning of Code Section 280G) on the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, could reasonably be considered to be "parachute payments" within
the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this  _Section 7.1(c)_ or otherwise in this Agreement, to the
extent that Buyer has provided misinformation, or Buyers omission of
information has resulted in misinformation, with respect to any Buyer
Payments, (x) there shall be no breach of the representation contained in
_Section 4.13(f)_ or the covenant contained herein, but only to the extent
caused by such omission or misinformation and (y) for all purposes of this
Agreement, no payment by, or benefit provided to, any Disqualified Individual
with respect to whom such misinformation or omission was provided shall be an
"excess parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of the Code, but only to the
extent that the classification of such person as a Disqualified Individual
was caused by such omission or misinformation.

Section 7.2 _Credit for Service and Benefit Accrual_. For purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals (other than benefit accruals under a
defined benefit pension plan) under each Buyer Plan in which Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing, Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates or the Surviving Corporation to, give each
Continuing Employee credit under each such Buyer Plan for all service with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing to the same extent as
such service was recognized for such purpose by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and/or their Affiliates prior to the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service shall not be credited to the extent that it
would result in a duplication of benefits.

Section 7.3 _WARN_. Following the Closing, Buyer shall not implement, or
permit the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to implement, any
plant closings, mass layoffs, employee layoffs, or similar events that
individually or in the aggregate would give rise to any obligations or
liabilities on the part of the Stockholders Representative, any Stockholders
or any of their respective Affiliates under the WARN Act or any similar Law,
and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
provide any required notice under the WARN Act or any similar Law, and to
otherwise comply with any such Law with respect to any "plant closing" or
"mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act or similar Law) or employee layoff
or similar event affecting the employees of the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries.

 



49 Section 7.4 _No Amendment_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing contained in this _Article VII_ shall (i) be deemed to be
the adoption of, or an amendment to, any employee benefit plan, as that term
is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or otherwise limit the right of the
Company, Buyer or their respective Affiliates (including the Subsidiaries of
the Company and the Surviving Corporation), to amend, modify or terminate any
such employee benefit plan or (ii) give any third party any right to enforce
the provisions of this  _Article VII_.

_ARTICLE VIII_

 

 _TAX MATTERS_

 

Section 8.1 _Tax Returns_.

 

(a) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is required to file a Tax Return
for a Straddle Period, the parties agree that the amount of income Taxes for
such Straddle Period that are attributable to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined based on an interim
closing of the books of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as of the
close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable
period of any partnership or other-pass through entity in which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to
terminate at such time). For purposes of this _Section 8.1(a)_, (i) any item
determined on an annual or periodic basis (including amortization and
depreciation deductions and the effects of graduated rates) shall be allocated
to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date based on the
relative number of days in such portion of the Straddle Period as compared to
the number of days in the entire Straddle Period and (ii) the amount of
property Taxes, annual franchise Taxes based on authorized shares or other
periodic Taxes allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be equal to the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Straddle Period.

 

(b) The Stockholders Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods that end on or before the Closing
Date. The Stockholders Representative shall provide a copy of each such Tax
Return that will be filed after the Closing Date to the Buyer for its
review and comment not later than thirty (30) days prior to the deadline for
filing each such Tax Return (taking into account all applicable extensions)
and the Stockholders Representative shall consider in good faith any
reasonable comments made by the Buyer on such Tax Return. Notwithstanding
anything in this _Section 8.1_ to the contrary, the parties hereto agree that
any Company Tax Benefits shall be reflected on the applicable Tax Returns for
the Tax periods that end on the Closing Date or, where applicable, the
portion of a Straddle Period ending on (and

 



50  including) the Closing Date, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.
Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries to
apply any net operating loss of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries for the taxable year ending on the Closing Date as a carryback to
the preceding tax years to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

(c) The Buyer and the Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely
file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all taxable periods beginning after the Closing Date and for
each Straddle Period (each a " _Post-Closing Tax Return_ "). To the extent
that a Post-Closing Tax Return includes any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
such Post-Closing Tax Return shall be prepared on a basis consistent with
existing procedures, practices, and accounting methods, unless such procedure,
practice, accounting method, or other contemplated treatment is contrary to
applicable Law. The Buyer shall provide a copy of each Post-Closing Tax
Return that includes a Pre-Closing Tax Period (together with notice of any
departure from past practice reflected on such return) to the Stockholders
Representative for its review and comment not later than thirty (30) days
prior to the deadline for filing each such Post-Closing Tax Return (taking
into account all applicable extensions) and the Buyer shall consider in good
faith all reasonable comments made by the Stockholders Representative on
such Post-Closing Tax Return. Except to the extent such Post-Closing Tax
Return has been prepared on a basis inconsistent with past practice,
Stockholders Representative shall (or shall cause the Stockholders to) pay to
the Buyer in immediately available funds no later than five (5) days prior to
the due date for the filing of such Post-Closing Tax Return that portion of
the Taxes shown as due on such Post-Closing Tax Return that is allocable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant to _Section 8.1_.

(d) Except in connection with any Tax Matter resolved pursuant to _Section
8.4_ (including consistent correlative adjustments to Tax Returns for non-
audited taxable periods), (i) the Buyer shall not voluntarily, without the
prior written consent of the Stockholders Representative (which consent shall
not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld, or delayed), (a) amend, or request
or permit the amendment of any Tax Return of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries filed or required to be filed before the Closing Date or (b)
apply to any Taxing Authority for any binding or non-binding opinion, ruling,
or other determination with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries in
relation to any act, matter, or transaction that occurred on or before the
Closing date, and (ii) except in response to any request or inquiry from a
Taxing Authority, the Buyer shall take commercially reasonable efforts not to
voluntarily furnish to any Taxing Authority any information (in writing or
otherwise) regarding any such Tax Returns or, with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, any act, matter, or transaction that occurred on or before
the Closing Date, in the case of each of (i) and(ii), if such action would
give rise to an indemnification obligation under  _Section 8.3_.

Section 8.2 _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes (including any costs and
expenses relating thereto) shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Buyer
and fifty percent (50%) by the Stockholders, regardless of whether such
Transfer Taxes become due or payable on or after the Closing Date. The Buyer
shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and timely file (or cause to be
timely filed) all Tax Returns required to be filed

 



51  in respect of such Transfer Taxes and shall transmit to the appropriate
Taxing Authority the Transfer Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns, provided
that the Buyer shall provide a copy of each Tax Return required to be filed
in respect of a Transfer Tax to the Stockholders Representative for its
review and comment not later than thirty (30) days prior to filing such Tax
Return (taking into account all applicable extensions), and the Buyer shall
consider in good faith all reasonable comments made by the Stockholders
Representative on such Tax Return. The Stockholders Representative shall (or
shall cause the Stockholders to) pay to the Buyer the Stockholders fifty
percent (50%) share of such Transfer Taxes in immediately available funds no
later than five (5) days prior to the date such Transfer Taxes are due. The
Buyer and the Stockholders Representative shall cooperate and take any
action reasonably requested by the other in order to lawfully minimize such
Transfer Taxes. The Buyer shall provide to the Stockholders Representative a
true and complete copy of each such Tax Return as filed and evidence of the
timely filing thereof.

Section 8.3 _Tax Indemnification_. The Stockholders covenant and agree,
severally but not jointly, to pay, and to indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, and any of their Affiliates
from and against all Losses relating to, or arising out of (i) any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty relating to Taxes made by the
Company in this Agreement as of the Closing Date (except in the case of any
such representation or warranty that is made as of a specific date, the breach
or inaccuracy of such representation or warranty to be true and correct as of
such date), (ii) all Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries (or the non-
payment thereof) for taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before
the Closing Date (taking into account the allocation provisions of  _Section
8.1(a)_ in the case of Straddle Periods), except to the extent such Taxes were
treated as current liabilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
purposes of calculating Final Net Working Capital, (iii) all Taxes required
to be paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date by
reason of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) having been a member of an Affiliated
Group on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or
foreign law rule or regulation, (iv) all Taxes of any Person (other than the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) required to be paid by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, where the liability of the
Company or the applicable Subsidiary for such Taxes is attributable to an
event or transaction occurring before the Closing Date, and (v) all Transfer
Taxes for which the Stockholders are responsible under _Section 8.2_. To the
extent that any Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification
hereunder for any Losses pursuant to this  _Section 8.3_, then each
Stockholder party hereto shall indemnify such Buyer Indemnified Party for the
amount of such Loss multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
cash Merger Consideration actually paid to such Stockholder hereunder, and
the denominator of which is the aggregate cash Merger Consideration actually
paid to all Fully Diluted Common Holders (it being acknowledged and agreed
that such indemnification obligation is several and not joint as among
the Stockholders). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no
event shall any such Person have any indemnification or other obligations
pursuant to, under or in respect of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
in excess of the amount of cash Merger

 



52  Consideration actually paid to such Person hereunder, and the total amount
that any Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification
hereunder for any Losses pursuant to this  _Section 8.3_ shall not, in any
event, exceed the aggregate Merger Consideration. The indemnification
obligations pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall survive the Closing and shall
continue in full force and effect until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations.

Section 8.4 _Contest Provisions_. Each of the Buyer and the
Stockholders Representative shall promptly notify (a " _Tax Claim Notice_ ")
the other upon receipt of notice of any pending or threatened audits,
assessments, adjustments, or other proceedings with respect to Taxes for which
such other party (or such other partys Affiliates) may be liable hereunder
(each a " _Tax Matter_ "), _provided_ that a partys failure to comply with
this notice provision shall not affect such partys right to
indemnification hereunder unless (and only to the extent that) the other
party is materially adversely prejudiced as a consequence of such failure.
Such Tax Claim Notice shall include (i) a description in reasonable detail (to
the extent known by such Buyer Indemnified Party (as defined below)) of the
facts constituting the basis for such claim and the amount of the Losses
claimed, if known and quantifiable, (ii) a statement that such Buyer
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under  _Section 8.3_ and a
reasonable explanation of the basis therefor and (iii) a demand for payment in
the amount of Losses set forth in the Tax Claim Notice. The Buyer shall have
the right to control, conduct, contest, and defend all Tax Matters relating
to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, provided
that, the Stockholders Representative shall be entitled (at its sole cost and
expense) (A) to participate in the defense of and, at its option, after
providing written notice to the Buyer, take control of the complete defense
of, any Tax Matter, but only to the extent that such Tax Matter pertains
solely to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and (B) to
employ counsel of its choice for purposes of the foregoing. The Buyer shall,
at the cost of the Stockholders Representative (provided that the
Stockholders Representative will only be liable for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses and such expenses shall be paid first from the Reserve Amount),
procure all assistance that the Stockholders Representative may reasonably
require in relation to any action taken with respect to any Tax Matter with
respect to which the Stockholders Representative has assumed control in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. The Buyer shall procure
such evidence that the Stockholders Representative is authorized to take such
action on behalf and in the name of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries as the Stockholders Representative may reasonably request with
respect to such Tax Matter, including responding (in writing or otherwise) to
any audit inquiry from any Taxing Authority, attending and
conducting interviews, meetings, discussions and negotiations with any Taxing
Authority, negotiating and concluding compromises, agreements and settlements
with any Taxing Authority, lodging requests for ruling, opinions or
determinations with any Taxing Authority or lodging or instituting
objections, applications, appeals and other Litigations with any Taxing
Authority, tribunal or court. A party in control of a Tax Matter for which the
other party (or such other partys Affiliates) may be liable hereunder shall
(i) keep the other party fully informed regarding the status and progress of
such Tax Matter and (ii) provide to the other party drafts of any
correspondence to or from any Taxing Authority and consider in good faith any
comments of the other party (or its advisors) with regard to such

 



53  correspondence. Neither party may agree to settle any claim for Taxes for
which the other may be liable without the prior consent of such other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

Section 8.5 _Buyer s Receiving or Using of Refunds and Overpayments_. If,
following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries,
the Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates (i) receives or enjoys any
refund, credit, rebate, or reduction in Taxes or (ii) utilizes the benefit of
any overpayment or prepayment of Taxes, which, in either of the foregoing
clauses (i) or (ii), arises out of a Tax paid by the Company or any of its
Affiliates in respect of a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending before
the Closing Date, the Buyer shall, within five (5) days of the written demand
of the Stockholders Representative therefor, pay or transfer, or cause to be
paid or transferred, to the Stockholders Representative on behalf of the
Fully Diluted Common Holders the amount of the refund, credit, rebate,
reduction, payment, or overpayment (including interest thereon) received,
enjoyed, or utilized by the Buyer or its Affiliates, except to the extent that
such amounts were treated as current assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for purposes of computing Final Net Working Capital or were
previously paid to the Buyer by the Stockholders pursuant to _Section 8.3_
and net of any Taxes and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their Affiliates in connection
with the receipt or accrual of such refund, credit, rebate, reduction,
payment, or overpayment; _provided_ that any such payment that is a
Compensatory Payment shall be paid by the Company (or a Subsidiary of the
Company) through its payroll system and in accordance with the Companys (or
such Subsidiarys) standard withholding and payroll practices and procedures
to the Person to the Person identified in writing by the Stockholders
Representative as the Person to whom such Compensatory Payment is to be made.
The Buyer agrees to notify the Stockholders Representative promptly of the
receipt of any amount described in this _Section 8.5_. In the event that any
item described in this _Section 8.5_ and paid to the Stockholders
Representative is subsequently reduced as a result of any adjustment required
by any Governmental Authority, Stockholders Representative shall pay or
transfer, or cause to be paid or transferred, to the Buyer the amount of such
reduction within five (5) days of Buyers written demand therefor.

 

Section 8.6 _Assistance and Cooperation_. Following the Closing Date, each of
Buyer and the Stockholders Representative shall cooperate fully in preparing
any Tax Returns with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and in
preparing for any audits of, inquiries by, or disputes with any Taxing
Authorities regarding, any applicable Tax Returns with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries and payments in respect thereof, including (a)
providing timely notice to the other of any pending or proposed audits or
assessments with respect to Taxes for which such other party or any of its
Affiliates may have a liability under this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements, (b) furnishing the other with copies of all relevant
correspondence received from any Taxing Authority (whether before, on, or
after the Closing Date) in connection with any audit or information request
with respect to any Taxes referred to in clause (a) of this Section and (c)
making available to the other party during normal business hours, all Books
and Records, Tax Returns or portions thereof (together with related paperwork
and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Taxing
Authorities), proof of

 



54  payment of Taxes, documents, files, officers or employees (without
substantial interruption of employment) or other relevant information
necessary or useful for such purposes, in each case, whether or not in
existence as of the Closing Date.

Section 8.7 _Closing Date Course of Business; Closing of the Tax Year_.
For the portion of the Closing Date after the time of Closing, other than
transactions expressly contemplated hereby, the Buyer shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to carry on their business only in
the ordinary course in the same manner as previously conducted. Except as
expressly contemplated in this Agreement, the Buyer shall not, and shall not
permit the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to, take any
action during the portion of the Closing Date after the time of Closing that
could increase the Stockholders liability for Taxes (including any liability
of the Stockholders (or the requirement that any funds in the General Escrow
Account be used to) to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for Taxes
pursuant to this Agreement). Buyer shall include, and shall cause the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries that is organized under the Laws of the United
States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia to be included,
immediately after the Closing Date, as a member of the Affiliated Group (for
U.S. federal income tax purposes) of which Buyer is a member (or if Buyer is a
disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, of which Buyers
corporate owner is a member), and the Company and each such Subsidiary shall
be included in the consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Return filed by such
Affiliated Group for the first taxable period beginning after the Closing
Date.

 

Section 8.8 _Maintenance of Buyer s Books and Records_. Until the applicable
statute of limitations (including periods of waiver) has run for any Tax
Returns filed or required to be filed with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries covering the periods up to and including the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, retain or cause to be retained all
Books and Records in existence on the Closing Date and, following the Closing
Date, shall provide the Stockholders Representative access to such Books and
Records and the equivalent Books and Records prepared following the
Closing Date for inspection and copying by the Stockholders Representative
and its Affiliates, or their agents upon reasonable request and upon
reasonable notice. After the expiration of such period, no Books and Records
shall be destroyed by Buyer without first advising the Stockholders
Representative in writing and giving the Stockholders Representative a
reasonable opportunity to obtain possession thereof, with any costs of
transferring the Books and Records to be paid by the Stockholders
Representative.

Section 8.9 _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Any payment by Buyer or
the Stockholders Representative, as the case may be, pursuant to _Section
2.11_, _Section 8.3_ or _Section 8.5_ shall be treated, to the fullest
extent possible under applicable Law, as an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration for tax purposes.

Section 8.10 _Article VIII Governs_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the provisions of this _Article VIII_ (and not those of
_Article X_ ), shall govern the manner in which Tax Matters are conducted and
resolved.

62 (iv) neither the Stockholders nor Buyer shall have any obligations under
or liabilities from and after the applicable Survival Date; _provided_ that

the terms of this _Article X_ prior to the expiration of the applicable
Survival Date will survive beyond the applicable Survival Date until such
claim is finally and conclusively resolved;

(v) neither a Buyer Indemnified Party, nor the Buyer Indemnified Parties as a
group or class, shall be entitled to recover from the Stockholders pursuant to
this _Article X_ more than once in respect of the same Losses suffered, and
neither a Stockholder Indemnified Party, nor the Stockholder Indemnified
Parties as a group or class, shall be entitled to recover from Buyer or
Surviving Corporation pursuant to this _Article X_ more than once in respect
of the same Losses suffered;

 

(vi) each Buyer Indemnified Party and Stockholder Indemnified Party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to mitigate any indemnifiable Loss, and in the
event that a Buyer Indemnified Party or Stockholder Indemnified Party fails to

Corporation (as Indemnified Party) shall have no liability for any portion of
such Loss that reasonably could have been avoided had the Buyer Indemnified
Party or Stockholder Indemnified Party, as applicable, made such efforts;

 

(vii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein but subject to the
provisions of this _Section 10.5(a)(vii)_, with respect to any Losses with

remedy and source of recovery shall be the funds in the General Escrow
Account except as follows:

(A) there shall be a right of indemnification against the Stockholders, which
shall not be subject to the Deductible Amount or the Cap, for any Losses
resulting from fraud or a breach of any Fundamental Representation for which
Buyer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.3(c)_ or
_10.3(d)_ ;  _provided_ , that if at any time any funds remain in the General
Escrow Account, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall first seek recovery from
the funds in the General Escrow Account with respect to any such Losses prior
to seeking indemnification from any Stockholder; and

(B) for any Losses for which Buyer is entitled to indemnification pursuant
to  _Section 10.3(e)_, there shall be a right of indemnification against the
Stockholders which shall not be subject to the Deductible Amount or the Cap,
and the General Escrow Account shall not be available to satisfy such
indemnification. 

To the extent that any Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification hereunder from the Stockholders for any Losses set forth in
clause _(a)_ of this _Section 10.5(a)(vii)_ (other than a breach of a
Fundamental Representation made

 



63  pursuant to _Article III_ ) with respect to which a Buyer Indemnified Party
has not received in full an indemnification payment hereunder and no funds
then remain in either the General Escrow Account or Merger Consideration
Escrow Account (or in the case of an indemnification for a Loss specified in
clause _(b)_ of this _Section 10.5(a)(vii)_, whether or not such funds
remain in such escrow accounts), then each Stockholder party hereto shall
indemnify such Buyer Indemnified Party for the amount of such Loss multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the cash Merger Consideration
actually paid to such Stockholder hereunder, and the denominator of which is
the aggregate cash Merger Consideration actually paid to all Fully Diluted
Common Holders (it being acknowledged and agreed that such indemnification
obligation is several and not joint as among the Stockholders). In the case of
a breach of a Fundamental Representation made pursuant to _Article III_ ,
only the Stockholder or Stockholders who have so breached such Fundamental
Representation shall indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Party and only up to the
amount of the Cash Merger Consideration actually paid to such Stockholder or
Stockholders; and

(viii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) the parties
acknowledge and agree that no Stockholder or holder of Common Stock Options
that is not a signatory hereto has any liability or obligations pursuant to
this _Article X_ ; and (ii) with respect to any claim for fraud by any Buyer
Indemnified Party, the limitations set forth in this _Article X_ shall apply
solely to any claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article X_ made in
respect of such fraud.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except as provided in
_Section 2.11_ (Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustment), _Section
6.6_ (Directors and Officers Exculpation; Indemnification), _Article VIII_
(Tax Matters), _Article XI_ (Termination) or _Section 12.6_ (Equitable
Relief), and except in the case of fraud and for the right of specific
performance, from and after the Closing the rights and remedies of Buyer, the
Company, the Stockholders Representative and the Stockholders, and any Buyer
Indemnified Party (each Buyer Indemnified Party is referred to herein as an "
_Indemnified Party_ "), under this _Article X_ are exclusive and in lieu of
any and all other rights and remedies which Buyer, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Stockholders Representative, or the Stockholders, or any
Indemnified Party, may have under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or
otherwise against each other with respect to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement and with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, and Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Stockholders
Representative and the Stockholders each expressly waives and releases and
agrees to waive and release any and all other rights or causes of action it
or its Affiliates may have against the other party or its Affiliates now or in
the future under any Law with respect to the preceding matters. In furtherance
of the foregoing, subject to the exceptions set forth in the preceding
sentence, each of the parties hereby waives, on behalf of itself and each of
the other Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than
claims and causes of action based on actual fraud) that it may have against
any other parties to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement with respect to
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or in respect of the transactions
contemplated 

 



64  hereby or thereby arising under or based upon any applicable Law or
otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
_Article X_ , or the provisions of  _Section 2.11_ (Post-Closing Merger
Consideration Adjustment), _Section 6.6_ (Directors and Officers
Exculpation; Indemnification), _Article VIII_ (Tax Matters), _Article XI_
(Termination) or  _Section 12.6_ (Equitable Relief)).

Section 10.6 _Adjustments to Losses_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Buyer Indemnified
Party shall have any right to indemnification under this _Article X_ with
respect to any Losses to the extent such Losses relate to any item
specifically included on, or is a liability specifically reserved or accrued
for (whether in whole or in part) in the Closing Statement or the calculation
of the Final Payment Amount (or any component thereof) (as finally agreed
upon or determined pursuant to _Section 2.11_) or that is otherwise
specifically taken into account in the calculation of any adjustment to the
Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section 2.11_.

(b) For all purposes of this _Article X_ and _Section 8.3_, " _Losses_ "
shall be net of any amounts paid or payable to an Indemnified Party under any
Insurance Policy or Contract in connection with the facts giving rise to the
right of indemnification hereunder, and each Indemnified Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to recover all amounts payable from an insurer or
other third party under any such insurance policy or Contract prior to seeking
indemnification hereunder; _provided_ , that the amount deemed to be paid
under such Insurance Policies shall be net of (x) the deductible for such
policies and (y) any increase in the premium for such policies arising from
such Losses.

(c) If any Buyer Indemnified Party or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries recovers or is entitled to recover (whether by payment, discount,
credit, relief, insurance or otherwise) from a third party a sum which
indemnifies or compensates such Buyer Indemnified Party, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (in whole or in part) in respect of any Loss which is the
subject matter of the claim, such Buyer Indemnified Party, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall take all reasonable steps to enforce
recovery against the third party and any actual recovery (less any reasonable
costs incurred in obtaining such recovery) shall reduce or satisfy, as the
case may be, such claim to the extent of such recovery. If Stockholders
Representative or any Stockholder has paid an amount, or any amount is paid
out of the General Escrow Account, in discharge of any claim under this
_Article X_ or any Buyer Indemnified Party or the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled to recover (whether by payment,
discount, credit, relief, insurance or otherwise) from a third party a sum
which indemnifies or compensates such Buyer Indemnified Party or the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (in whole or in part) in respect of
any Loss which is the subject matter of the claim, the Stockholders
Representative and each Stockholder shall be subrogated to all rights that
such Buyer Indemnified Party or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries has or would otherwise have in respect of the claim against the
third party, or if subrogation is not possible or, the Buyer Indemnified
Party, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall take all action
necessary to enforce such recovery and shall pay (or cause to be paid) to
Stockholders Representative (for the

 



65  benefit of the Fully Diluted Common Holders) as soon as practicable after
receipt an amount equal to (x) any sum recovered from the third party less any
costs and expenses reasonably incurred in obtaining such recovery or, if
less, (y) the amount previously paid by the Stockholders Representative or
any Stockholder (or the amount of funds in the General Escrow Account paid or
distributed) to such Buyer Indemnified Party, the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries.

Section 10.7 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. All payments
made (or deemed to be made, in accordance with this Agreement) by any
indemnifying party (" _Indemnifying Party_ ") to an Indemnified Party with
respect to any claim pursuant to _Section 10.3_ shall be treated, to
the fullest extent possible under applicable Law, as adjustments to the
Merger Consideration for Tax purposes.

Section 10.8 _Scheduled Indemnification_. The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall
be reimbursed for all attorneys fees and reasonable costs and expenses
arising out of or related to the matters set forth on _Schedule 10.8_ , as
well as 50% of any Losses resulting from any settlement or Order arising out
of or related to any dispute, litigation or proceeding involving the matters
set forth on _Schedule 10.8_. The obligations pursuant to this _Section 10.8_
will not be subject to the Deductible Amount, but will be subject to the Cap,
and such fees, costs, expenses and Losses shall be satisfied solely through
payment from the General Escrow Account.

 

Section 10.9 _Third-Party Claim Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) In the event that any written claim or demand for which an Indemnifying
Party may have liability to any Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted
against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party
(a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no
event more than thirty days following such Indemnified Partys receipt of a
Third-Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying Party of such Third-Party Claim,
the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent,
if any, then ascertainable, any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant
time constraints relating thereto, a reasonably detailed explanation of the
events giving rise to such Third-Party Claim and any other material details
pertaining thereto (a " _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ that the failure to
timely give a Claim Notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall
have been actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly following
the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third-Party Claim.

 

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
that it elects to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third-Party Claim,
then, except as hereinafter provided, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings, which
proceedings shall be promptly settled or prosecuted by it to a final
conclusion;  _provided_ _however_ , the Indemnifying Party shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to the

 



66  entry of any judgment against the Indemnified Party or enter into any
settlement or compromise which does not include, as an unconditional term
thereof, the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of
a release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party, from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation. If any
Indemnified Party desires to participate in, but not control, any
such defense or settlement, it may do so at its sole cost and expense.
Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to,
settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent. If the Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of a Third-Party Claim and is in good faith contesting such Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement, compromise
or discharge of a Third-Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
recommend and that by its terms (i) obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay
(or obligates the use of the funds in the General Escrow Account to pay) the
full amount of Losses in connection with such Third-Party Claim (other than
with respect to any Losses (or portion thereof) that are not required to be
paid as a result of such Losses being (or portion thereof) within the
Deductible Amount or in excess of the Cap), (ii) fully and unconditionally
(other than conditions relating solely to the making of the settlement
payment) releases the Indemnified Party in connection with such Third-Party
Claim and (iii) imposes no non-monetary or other remedy relating to the
Indemnified Party or its conduct or business.

(c) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim, including by
providing reasonable access to each others relevant Books and Records, and
employees. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of Books
and Records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party
Claim, and making employees and Representatives available on a
mutually convenient basis during normal business hours to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable commercial
efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and
others representing any party to a Third-Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

(d) In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this _Section
10.9_ and _Section 8.4_ in respect of any Tax Contest, the provisions of
_Section 8.4_ shall control

Section 10.10 _Direct Claim Indemnification Procedures_. Except with respect
to claims relating to Taxes (which are the subject to _Article VIII_ ), each
Indemnified Party shall assert any claim on account of any Losses which do not
result from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") by giving the
Indemnifying Party written notice thereof reasonably promptly (and, in any
event, no later than 30 days following the Indemnified Partys discovery of
the applicable Losses reasonably likely to give rise to a claim under this
_Article X_ ). Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct
Claim in

 



67  reasonable detail, include copies of all available material written evidence
thereof and indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
Losses that have been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ that the failure to timely give such notice shall not affect the
rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder unless (i) such failure has a
material prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Direct Claim, (ii) the Indemnifying
Partys or the Indemnified Partys ability to mitigate such Direct Claim, or
(iii) the indemnification obligations are materially increased as a result of
such failure.

Section 10.11 _Release of Escrow Fund_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties
hereby acknowledge and agree that, for so long as there are any funds in the
General Escrow Account, (i) in the event that Buyer and Stockholders
Representative agree pursuant to a joint memorandum of agreement there is any
amount due and payable to any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Agreement (an " _General Escrow Account Indemnification Payment_ "), or
(ii) in the event that there should be issued an arbitration determination or
award pursuant to _Section 12.4_ or a binding Order, in each case, providing
for the payment to any Buyer Indemnified Party of any amount from the General
Escrow Account, then, upon written notice by Buyer (with a copy to the
Stockholders Representative) and Stockholders Representative (with a copy
to Buyer), in the event of an Agreed Claim, or upon written notice by Buyer
(with a copy to the Stockholders Representative) in the event of such an
arbitration determination or award or an Order, to the Escrow Agent, a release
of funds from the General Escrow Account equal in amount to the General
Escrow Account Indemnification Payment shall become immediately due and
payable, and the Escrow Agent shall be directed to release such amount to
Buyer within two (2) Business Days following the date of such direction
notice.

(b) On the General Survival Date (or, if such day is not a Business Day, then
on the immediately succeeding Business Day), all remaining amounts in the
General Escrow Account shall become due and payable, and the Escrow Agent
shall release (and Buyer and Stockholders Representative shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to so release) all such remaining amounts in the General Escrow
Account in cash to Stockholders Representative (for the benefit of the Fully
Diluted Common Holders); _provided_ that if, on such day, any claim or claims
for indemnification in accordance with the requirements of _Section 10.9_ or
_Section 10.10_, as applicable, by any Buyer Indemnified Party to the
Stockholders Representative and the Escrow Agent under this _Article X_ is
pending, then the amount that would otherwise be paid by the Escrow Agent to
Stockholders Representative (for the benefit of the Fully Diluted Common
Holders) pursuant to this sentence shall be reduced by the amount of such
claim or claims. Such amount that is not so released from the General Escrow
Account as a result of such claim shall become due and payable when such claim
becomes an Agreed Claim, and the Escrow Agent shall, within two (2) Business
Days following the date on which Buyer and Stockholders Representative give
the Escrow Agent written notice of the occurrence of an Agreed Claim (with a
copy to the other party), release the applicable General Escrow Account
Indemnification Payment to Buyer, if any, and any remaining amounts 

 



68  in the General Escrow Account to the Stockholders Representative (for the
benefit of the Fully Diluted Common Holders). Subject to _Section 2.12_
hereof, when no claims made in accordance with the requirements of _Section
10.9_ or _Section 10.10_, as applicable, against the Escrow Fund are
remaining, the Escrow Agent shall release the remaining amounts to
Stockholders Representative (for the benefit of the Fully Diluted Common
Holders).

_ARTICLE XI_

_Outside Date_ "), if the Closing shall not have occurred, subject to _Section
12.6_, prior to the Outside Date, such Outside Date to be extended an
additional one hundred twenty (120) days (i) should the Company or the Buyer

the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or any similar request for additional
information that may be issued by any Governmental Entity pursuant to any
Competition/Investment Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (ii) if on the first date that the Outside Date would
otherwise occur the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 9.1(a)_ (by
reason of a Request for Additional Information or similar request for
additional information, as referred to in clause (i)) and/or _Section
9.1(b)_ shall not have been satisfied but all other conditions to Closing set
forth in _Article IX_ shall be satisfied or waived other than conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing; _provided_ that the right
to terminate this Agreement or extend the Outside Date pursuant to this
_Section 11.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party whose failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or
shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to
such date;

(c) by either Buyer or the Stockholders Representative in the event that any
Order restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, shall have become final and nonappealable;

 

(d) by Buyer, if there has been a material violation or breach by the Company
or Stockholders Representative of any representation or warranty (or any
such representation or warranty shall have become untrue in any material
respect after the date of this Agreement) or covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement which, in either case, would prevent the satisfaction of
or result in the failure of any condition to the obligations of Buyer or
Merger Sub at the Closing and such violation or breach has not been waived by
Buyer or, in the case of a breach of any covenant or agreement under 

 



69  this Agreement that is curable, has not been cured by the Company or
Stockholders Representative prior to the earlier to occur of (x) thirty (30)
days after receipt by the Company, as applicable, of written notice of such
breach from Buyer and (y) the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyer may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.1(d)_ at
any time during which Buyer or Merger Sub is in material breach of this
Agreement;

(e) by Stockholders Representative, if there has been a material violation
or breach by Buyer or Merger Sub of any representation or warranty (or any
such representation or warranty shall have become untrue in any material
respect after the date of this Agreement) or covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement which would, in either case, prevent the satisfaction of or
result in the failure of any condition to the obligations of the Company at
the Closing and such violation or breach has not been waived by the Company
or, with respect to a breach of any covenant or agreement under this
Agreement that is curable, has not been cured by Buyer prior to the earlier to
occur of (x) thirty (30) days after receipt by Buyer of written notice of such
breach from the Company or (y) the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Stockholders Representative may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 11.1(e)_ at any time during which the Company is in
material breach of this Agreement; or

(f) by Buyer, if there shall have occurred a Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 11.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 11.1_, this Agreement, insofar as it
relates to the parties rights and obligations relating thereto, shall
thereafter become void and have no effect, and no party shall have any
liability to the other party or their respective Affiliates, or
their respective directors, officers, stockholders, partners, members,
attorneys, accountants, agents, representatives or employees or their heirs,
successors and permitted assigns, except for the obligations of the parties
contained in  _Section 6.5_, this _Section 11.2_ and _Article XII_
(including _Section 12.6_) (and any related definitional provisions set forth
in _Article I_ or _Appendix A_ ), and except that nothing in this
Section shall relieve either party from liability for any willful and
material breach of this Agreement that arose prior to or concurrently with
such termination.

days after mailing (or one (1) Business Day in the case of overnight air
courier services), except that any notice of change of address shall be

Section 12.2 _Amendment; Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, (i) in the case of an amendment, by Buyer and the Stockholders
Representative, or (ii) in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom
such waiver is intended to be effective (provided that the Stockholders
Representative may waive any provision of this Agreement on behalf of any
Stockholder); _provided_ , _however_ , that after the adoption of this
Agreement by the requisite number of Stockholders in accordance with
the Organizational Documents of the Company and the provisions of the DGCL,
no amendment shall be made that by law requires further approval by the
Stockholders without obtaining such requisite approval under the DGCL, except
to the extent the approval of such Stockholders can be given by the
Stockholders Representative under applicable law. No failure or delay by any
party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.

Section 12.3  _No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties_. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party to this Agreement may assign any of
its rights or delegate any of its obligations

 



72  under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party
hereto and any purported assignment in violation of the foregoing shall be
null and void. Except to the extent expressly set forth in _Section 6.6_,
_Section 12.5_, _Section 12.16_, _Section 12.19_, _Article X_ or _Article
XI_ , nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any Person other than Buyer, the Company, the Stockholders and the
Stockholders Representative, and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns, any rights, benefits or remedies under
or by reason of this Agreement.

 

Section 12.4 _Entire Agreement; Inconsistency_. This Agreement (including all
Schedules, Exhibits and Appendices hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements contain the entire agreement among the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters.
In the event and to the extent that there shall be an inconsistency between
the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement or an Ancillary Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail. The
provisions of this Agreement shall be construed according to their fair
meaning and neither for nor against any party hereto irrespective of which
party caused such provisions to be drafted. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that it has been represented by an attorney in connection with
the preparation and execution of this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements.

 

Section 12.5 _Satisfaction of Obligations_. Any obligation of any party to any
other under this Agreement, that is performed, satisfied or fulfilled
completely by an Affiliate of such party shall be deemed to have been
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.

 

Section 12.6 _Equitable Relief_. The parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not to be performed as required by their
specific terms or were to be otherwise breached, irreparable damage will occur
and no adequate remedy at Law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches, and to specific performance of the terms, of
this Agreement (including causing the transactions contemplated hereby to be
consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions thereto set forth in
this Agreement), in addition to any other remedy at Law or equity. No party
hereto shall oppose, argue, contend or otherwise be permitted to raise as a
defense that an adequate remedy at Law exists or that specific performance or
equitable or injunctive relief is inappropriate or unavailable. The parties
hereto further agree that nothing in this _Section 12.6_ shall require any
party hereto to institute any Litigation for specific performance under this
_Section 12.6_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right
under _Article XI_ , nor shall the commencement of any Litigation pursuant to
this _Section 12.6_ or anything set forth in this _Section 12.6_ restrict or
limit the parties respective right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms hereof; it being understood and agreed by the parties, prior to
the Closing, that during the pendency of any Litigation initiated by a party
under this  _Section 12.6_, each of the parties shall maintain their
respective rights to terminate this Agreement under _Section 11.1_. If any
party hereto, prior to the Closing, brings any Litigation to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other
party (or a Litigation for

 



73  monetary damages as described in the following sentence) and the Outside
Date has not yet passed, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by
(x) the amount of time during which such Litigation is pending, plus 20
Business Days or (y) such other time period established by the Delaware Court
presiding over such Litigation. If any party hereto, prior to the Closing,
institutes a Litigation for injunctive relief or specific performance and a
court of competent jurisdiction does not award injunctive relief or specific
performance in a final Order in accordance with this _Section 12.6_, then
such party may institute a Litigation for monetary damages to the extent
damages are available under _Section 11.2_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if any party is awarded injunctive relief or
specific performance as a result of which the Closing actually occurs,
such equitable relief shall be such partys sole and exclusive remedy under
this Agreement solely with respect to failure to consummate the Closing.

 

Section 12.7 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the party incurring
such costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, complying with any
formal Request for Additional Information that may be issued under the HSR Act
by the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice or the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission or any similar request for additional information
that may be issued by any Governmental Entity pursuant to any
Competition/Investment Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
herein, (x) all filing fees to be paid in connection with the HSR Act or any
other Competition/Investment Law shall be paid by Buyer and (y) the fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the obligations to obtain DandO Insurance
set forth in _Section 6.6_ shall be paid by Buyer.

Section 12.8 _Schedules_. Any exception or qualification set forth on the
Schedules with respect to a particular representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be an exception or
qualification with respect to all other applicable representations, warranties
and covenants contained in this Agreement to the extent that it is readily
apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable
thereto; but shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by Buyer or the
Company, the Stockholders Representative or any Stockholder or to otherwise
imply that any such matter or Contract is material for the purposes of this
Agreement and shall not affect the interpretation of such term for the
purposes of this Agreement. In particular, (a) certain matters may be
disclosed on the Schedules that may not be required to be disclosed because
of certain minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this
Agreement, (b) the disclosure of any such matter does not mean that it meets
or surpasses any such minimum thresholds or materiality standards and (c) no
disclosure in the Schedules relating to any possible breach or violation of
any Contract or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any
such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. In no event shall
the listing of such matters in any Schedule be deemed or interpreted to expand
the scope of the Companys representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement. The section headings in the Schedules are for convenience
of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect the meaning or

 



74  interpretation of any information disclosed herein or any provision of this
Agreement. All attachments to the Schedules are incorporated by reference into
the Schedule in which they are directly or indirectly referenced. The
information contained in the Schedules is in all events subject to _Section
6.5_ and the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 12.9 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Selection of Forum_.
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS
OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, REGARDLESS OF THE
LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF
LAW THEREOF. Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any Litigation with
respect to any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contained in or contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless the Delaware
Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or federal court within the State
of Delaware) (such courts, collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ "), and
solely in connection with claims arising under this Agreement or the
transactions that are the subject of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action
or proceeding in the Delaware Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the
Delaware Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over
either party hereto, (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in
any such action or proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in
accordance with _Section 12.1_ of this Agreement, although nothing contained
in this Agreement shall affect the right to serve process in any other manner
permitted by Law and (v) agrees not to seek a transfer of venue on the basis
that another forum is more convenient. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (i) nothing in this _Section 12.9_ shall prohibit any party from
seeking or obtaining orders for conservatory or interim relief from any court
of competent jurisdiction and (ii) each party hereto agrees that any judgment
issued by a Delaware Court may be recognized, recorded, registered or enforced
in any jurisdiction in the world and waives any and all objections or defenses
to the recognition, recording, registration or enforcement of such judgment in
any such jurisdiction.

Section 12.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE
EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH
PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF

 



75  LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (b) SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (c) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (d) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND EACH ANCILLARY AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

 

Section 12.11 _Arbitration_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but except to
the extent provided in _Section 2.11_, all disputes among the parties hereto
arising after the Closing shall, if not otherwise resolved by discussions
between such parties, be submitted to binding arbitration by a panel of three
neutral arbitrators pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of
the American Arbitration Association (the " _AAA_ ").

(b) The parties shall contract with the arbitrators to commence
the arbitration hearing within thirty (30) days of the demand for arbitration
pursuant to _Section 12.11(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the parties
cannot agree on the arbitrators within such thirty (30) day period, the
arbitrators shall be selected by the New York, New York office of the AAA or,
if such office does not exist or is unable to make the selections, by the
office of the AAA nearest to New York, New York. Each arbitrator shall be a
lawyer knowledgeable and experienced in the applicable Laws concerning the
subject matter of the dispute. In any case no arbitrator shall be an
Affiliate, employee, consultant, officer, director or stockholder of any party
hereto, or otherwise have any current or previous relationship with either
the Company, the Stockholders or Buyer or their respective Affiliates. The
governing Law in _Section 12.9_ shall govern any such arbitration
proceedings. The arbitration shall be held in New York, New York. Any
arbitration award may be entered in and enforced by any court having
jurisdiction.

(c) The arbitrators, by accepting their appointment, undertake to conduct the
process such that the award be rendered within six (6) months of their
appointment. The determination of the majority of the arbitrators as to the
resolution of any dispute or any other decision to be made by the arbitrators
shall be binding and conclusive upon all parties. All rulings of the
arbitrators shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the parties except
to the extent that the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA
provide otherwise.

(d) If arbitrated, the arbitrators shall be given the authority to award fees
and costs to the prevailing party or as otherwise determined by the
arbitrators.

(e) Except as otherwise determined by the arbitrator pursuant to _Section
12.11(d)_ or as provided elsewhere in this Agreement, the expenses of any
arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties to such arbitration,
provided that each party shall pay for and bear the cost of its own experts,
evidence and legal counsel.

 



76 Section 12.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which, including those received via facsimile
transmission or email, shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall
constitute one and the same Agreement.

 

Section 12.13 _Headings_. The heading references herein and the table of
contents hereof are for convenience purposes only, and shall not be deemed to
limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.

Section 12.14 _No Setoff; No Withholding_. There shall be no right of setoff
or counterclaim with respect to any claim, debt or obligation, against
payments to any of Buyer, the Company, the Stockholders Representative,
holders of Company Stock Options or the Stockholders or their
respective Affiliates under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.
Except to the extent expressly set forth herein or as required by applicable
Law, any and all payments made to the Stockholders Representative, holders of
Company Stock Options or Stockholders under this Agreement (including
pursuant to _0_ ) shall be made free and clear of any deduction or
withholding.

 

Section 12.15 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions
hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

Section 12.16 _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed
or implied in this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any document,
certificate or instrument delivered in connection herewith or therewith, each

(a) The Stockholders hereby irrevocably appoint the Stockholders
Representative as the exclusive proxy, representative, agent and attorney-in-
fact of each of the Stockholders for all purposes under this Agreement, with
full power of substitution, to make all decisions and determinations and to
act and execute, deliver and receive all documents, instruments and consents
on behalf of such Stockholders at any time, in connection with, and that may
be necessary or appropriate to accomplish the intent and implement the
provisions of, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements contemplated
hereunder, and to facilitate the consummation of the Merger, and in
connection with the activities to be performed by or on behalf of the
Stockholders under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and each other
agreement, document, instrument or certificate referred to herein or therein
(including in connection with any and all claims for indemnification brought
pursuant to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements). The Stockholders
Representative may resign by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice
to each Stockholder and Buyer. Upon the resignation of the Stockholders
Representative, such Stockholders who, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, held a majority of the Company Stock shall appoint a replacement
Stockholders Representative to serve in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, _provided_ , that if the holders of a majority of the Company Stock
fail to appoint a replacement Stockholder Representative in accordance with
the preceding clause of this sentence within forty-five (45) days of such
Stockholders Representative resigning or becoming unable to serve, then Buyer
shall have the right to replace the Stockholder Representative who shall
serve until a successor is duly appointed by a majority of the Stockholders
party to this Agreement. The Stockholders Representative shall have no other
duties or obligations, at law, in equity, by contract or otherwise, to act on
behalf of any Stockholder, except for those duties or obligations expressly
set forth in this Agreement. The appointment as Stockholders Representative
shall not be deemed to create any partnership or other fiduciary or similar
relationship between the Stockholders Representative or any Stockholder.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Stockholders
Representative shall be granted the power to take any of the following
actions on behalf of such Stockholders: (i) to execute and deliver this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (in each case, with such modifications
or changes therein as to which the Stockholders Representative, in his, her
or its sole discretion, shall have consented) and to agree to such amendments
or modifications thereto as the Stockholders Representative, in his, her or
its sole discretion, may deem necessary or desirable; (ii) to give and
receive notices, communications and consents under this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements; (iii) to receive and distribute payments pursuant to
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements; (iv) to resolve any disputes
under, or waive any provision of, this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements;
(v) to authorize delivery to any Indemnified Party of cash or other property
from the General Escrow Account or Merger Consideration Escrow Account
pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; (vi) to assert any claim
or institute any Litigation; (vii) to investigate, defend, contest or litigate
any Litigation initiated by any Person against the Stockholders
Representative or the General Escrow Amount; (viii) to receive process on
behalf of any or all such Stockholders in any such Litigation; (ix) to
negotiate, enter into settlements and comprises of, resolve and comply with
orders of courts and awards of arbitrators or other

 



79  third party intermediaries with respect to any disputes arising under this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and with respect to indemnification
claims under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements; (x) to agree to any
offsets or other additions or subtractions of amounts to be paid under this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements; (xi) to cause the General Escrow Amount
and the Merger Consideration Escrow Amount to be invested in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, it being understood and
agreed that in no event shall the Stockholders Representative be deemed to be
providing investment advice with respect to the investment of any such funds,
nor shall it have any liability for any loss incurred in connection with the
investment of the General Escrow Amount or the Merger Consideration Escrow
Amount; (xii) to finalize any post-Closing adjustment of the
Merger Consideration; (xiii) to distribute any amounts to the Fully Diluted
Common Holders after the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement (including
_Section 2.11_, _Section 2.12_, _Section 2.13_,  _Section 8.5_, and
_Article X_ ) or the Escrow Agreement (after paying any portions thereof to
recipients of bonus payments) and (xiv) to make, execute, acknowledge and
deliver all such other agreements, guarantees, orders, receipts,
endorsements, notices, requests, instructions, certificates, stock powers,
letters and other writings, and, in general, to do any and all things and to
take any and all actions that the Stockholders Representative, in his, her or
its sole discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in
connection with or to consummate the Merger and carry out the activities
described in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. The Stockholders
Representative shall not be responsible for any Loss suffered by, or
liability of any kind to, such Stockholders arising out of any act done or
omitted by the Stockholders Representative in connection with the acceptance
or administration of the Stockholders Representatives duties hereunder,
except to the extent such act or omission constitutes gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

(c) Such appointment of the Stockholders Representative by the Stockholders
is coupled with an interest and may not be revoked in whole or in part
(including, upon the death or incapacity of any such Stockholder). Such
appointment is binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, estates,
personal representatives, successors and assigns of each such Stockholder. All
decisions of the Stockholders Representative are final and binding on all of
the Stockholders, and shall be deemed authorized, approved, ratified and
confirmed by the Stockholders, having the same force and effect as if
performed by, or pursuant to the direct authorization of, the Stockholders,
and no Stockholder shall have any right to challenge or otherwise question
any such action, decision or instruction. Each Stockholder hereby waives any
and all defenses which may be available to contest, negate or disaffirm any
action of the Stockholders Representative taken in connection with the
authority granted by this Agreement.

(d) The Stockholders Representative shall receive no compensation for service
as such, but shall be entitled to hold the Reserve Amount, and to use all or
a portion of the Reserve Amount to satisfy its payment obligations under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement and to reimburse itself for any and all
expenses, charges and liabilities, including reasonable attorneys fees
incurred by the Stockholders Representative in the performance or discharge
of its duties pursuant to this _Section 12.19_; _provided_ , _however_ , the
Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to hire counsel, accountants,
tax preparers and other advisors and experts to assist or advise it in

 



80  connection with the performance of its rights or obligations pursuant to
this _Section 12.19_ or under the Escrow Agreement, and all such reasonable
expenses incurred by the Stockholders Representative, including expenses
relating to any such counsel, accountant, tax preparer, advisor or expert,
shall be reimbursed using the Reserve Amount.

 

(e) The Stockholders shall indemnify on a several, but not joint basis (on a
pro rata basis, in proportion to their respective share of the Merger
Consideration) the Stockholders Representative for, and shall hold the
Stockholders Representative harmless against, any damage, loss, charge,
liability, claim, demand, action, suit, judgment, settlement, award, interest,
penalty, fee, cost and expense (including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements) incurred by the Stockholders Representative or any of its
Affiliates and any of their respective managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents, members, partners, stockholders, consultants, attorneys,
accountants, advisors, brokers, representatives or controlling persons, in
each case relating to the Stockholders Representatives conduct or role as
Stockholders Representative, other than damages, losses, charges,
liabilities, claims, demands, actions, suits, judgments, settlements, awards,
interest, penalties, fees, costs and expenses that have been finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have primarily resulted
from the Stockholders Representatives fraud or willful misconduct in
connection with its performance under this Agreement. This indemnification
shall survive the termination of this Agreement. The
Stockholders Representative shall have the right to cause the satisfaction
of some or all of such indemnification obligations using any then available
proceeds contained in the Reserve Amount. The Stockholders Representative
may, in all questions arising under this Agreement, rely on the advice of
counsel, advisor or expert, and for anything done, omitted or suffered in good
faith by the Stockholders Representative in accordance with such advice, and
the Stockholders Representative shall not be liable to the Stockholders or
any other person in connection therewith. In no event shall the Stockholders
Representative be liable hereunder or in connection herewith for any
consequential, indirect, incidental, special, unforeseen, exemplary or
punitive damages, including diminution of value, loss of business or
reputation or opportunity, and in particular, without limitation, no "multiple
of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or similar valuation methodology shall
be used in calculating the amount of Losses. The Stockholders Representative
shall not be liable to any Stockholder for any action taken or omitted by the
Stockholders Representative under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or
any other document executed or delivered hereunder, or in connection
therewith, except that the Stockholders Representative shall not be relieved
of any liability imposed by law to the extent it is finally determined to
have primarily resulted from fraud or willful misconduct of the Stockholders
Representative.

(i) Under no circumstances does Buyer have any obligations with regard to any
Stockholder, the Stockholders Representative or any Affiliates of any
Stockholder or the Stockholders Representative, except payment of amounts set
forth herein not to exceed the Base Enterprise Value plus the Milestone
Payments, if payable.
