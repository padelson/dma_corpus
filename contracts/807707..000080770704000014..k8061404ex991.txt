20       Purchaser and the Seller cannot agree on an Allocation, each

Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment after the Closing as specified
in this Section 2.07:   (a) Preliminary and Closing Statements of Net
Assets. (i) On or before  the date that is 25 calendar days following the
Closing, the Seller shall  deliver to the Purchaser the Preliminary Statement
of Net Assets.   (ii) As promptly as practicable, after the date that is 90
calendar  days following the Closing, the Seller shall deliver to the
Purchaser the  Closing Statement of Net Assets, together with the report
thereon of the  Seller\'s Accountants, stating that the Closing Statement of
Net Assets  fairly presents Net Assets of the Business as of the close of
business on  the date of the Closing in accordance with GAAP.   (b)
Disputes. (i) Subject to clause (ii) of this Section 2.07(b), the  Closing
Statement of Net Assets, the Closing Statement of Inventories and  the
Receivables Reserve set forth on the Closing Statement of Receivables 
delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser shall be final, binding and 
conclusive on the parties hereto.   (ii) The Purchaser may dispute any
amounts reflected on (A) the  Closing Statement of Net Assets, but only on
the basis that the amounts  reflected on the Closing Statement of Net Assets
were not arrived at in  accordance with GAAP (it being understood that any
adjustments, estimates,  accruals and calculations made on the Closing
Statement of Net Assets that  are made on the same basis as similar items on
the Interim Statement of Net  Assets shall be deemed to be made in accordance
with GAAP) or were arrived  at based on mathematical or clerical error, (B)
the Closing Statement of  Inventories but only on the basis that the amounts
reflected on the Closing  Statement of Inventories was not calculated in
accordance with the rules  set forth on Exhibit A hereto or that they were
arrived at based on  mathematical or clerical error and (C) the Receivables
Reserve, but only on  the basis that the Receivables Reserve was not arrived
at in accordance  with GAAP (it being understood that any adjustments,
estimates, accruals  and calculations made in respect of the Receivables
Reserve that are made  on the same basis as similar items on the Interim
Statement of Net Assets  shall be deemed to be made in accordance with GAAP)
or were arrived at  based on mathematical or clerical error; provided,
however, that the  Purchaser shall have notified the Seller and the Seller\'s
Accountants in  writing of each disputed item, specifying the estimated
amount thereof in  dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis
for such  dispute, within 30 Business Days of the Seller\'s delivery of the
Closing  Statement of Net Assets to the Purchaser. In the event of such a
dispute,  the Seller\'s Accountants and the Purchaser\'s Accountants shall
attempt to  reconcile their differences, and any resolution by them as to any
disputed  amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties
hereto. If  any such resolution by the Seller\'s Accountants and the
Purchaser\'s    23         Accountants regarding the Closing
Statement of Net Assets or the Closing  Statement of Inventories leaves in
dispute amounts the net effect of which  in the aggregate would not affect
the Final Net Working Capital Balance,  all such amounts remaining in dispute
shall then be deemed to have been  resolved in favor of the Closing Statement
of Net Assets or the Closing  Statement of Inventories, as applicable,
delivered by the Seller to the  Purchaser. If the Seller\'s Accountants and
the Purchaser\'s Accountants are  unable to reach a resolution with such
effect within 20 Business Days after  the receipt by the Seller and the
Seller\'s Accountants of the Purchaser\'s  written notice of dispute, the
Seller\'s Accountants and the Purchaser\'s  Accountants shall submit the
items remaining in dispute for resolution to  Deloitte and Touche LLP (or, if
such firm shall decline or is unable to act  or is not, at the time of such
submission, independent of the Seller and  the Purchaser, to another
independent accounting firm of international  reputation mutually acceptable
to the Seller and the Purchaser) (either  Deloitte and Touche LLP or such other
accounting firm being referred to  herein as the "Independent Accounting
Firm"), which shall, within 30  Business Days after such submission,
determine and report to the Seller and  the Purchaser upon such remaining
disputed items, and such report shall be  final, binding and conclusive on
the Seller and the Purchaser. The fees and  disbursements of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be allocated between  the Seller and the Purchaser in
the same proportion that the aggregate  amount of such remaining disputed
items so submitted to the Independent  Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully
disputed by each such party (as  finally determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm) bears to the total  amount of such remaining disputed items
so submitted.   (iii) In acting under this Agreement, the Seller\'s
Accountants, the  Purchaser\'s Accountants and the Independent Accounting
Firm shall be  entitled to the privileges and immunities of arbitrators.  
(c) Purchase Price Adjustments. (i) Preliminary Purchase Price  Adjustment.
(A) In the event that the Preliminary Net Working Capital  Balance set forth
on the Preliminary Statement of Net Assets is less than  $40,000,000 (the
"Target NWCB"), then there shall be a preliminary downward  adjustment of the
Purchase Price in an amount equal to such deficiency, the  Purchaser shall
deliver written notice to the Escrow Agent specifying the  amount of such
preliminary downward adjustment of the Purchase Price, and  the Escrow Agent
shall, within three Business Days of its receipt of such  notice and in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, pay an  amount (the
"Preliminary Purchase Price Reduction") equal to seventy-five  percent (75%)
of such deficiency to the Purchaser out of the Escrow Fund by  wire transfer
in immediately available funds. In the event that the Escrow  Fund is
insufficient to cover the amount of the Preliminary Purchase Price 
Reduction, then the Escrow Agent shall distribute the entire Escrow Fund to 
the Purchaser as provided above and the Seller or Audiovox, on behalf of  the
Seller, shall pay, on or prior to the same date as the Escrow Agent 
distributes the Escrow Fund to the Purchaser, an amount to the Purchaser,  by
wire transfer in immediately available funds, equal to the amount of  such
deficiency. No failure of the Purchaser to deliver a notice of the  type
specified in the immediately preceding sentence shall relieve the  Seller of
the obligation to pay the amount of such deficiency to the  Purchaser.   
24        (B) In the event that the Preliminary Net Working Capital
Balance  exceeds the Target NWCB, then there shall be a preliminary upward 
adjustment of the Purchase Price in an amount equal to such excess and the 
Purchaser shall pay on or before the date that is 30 days following the  date
of the Closing an amount (the "Preliminary Purchase Price Increase")  equal
to seventy-five percent (75%) of such excess to the Seller by wire  transfer
in immediately available funds. Following the preliminary purchase  price
adjustments described in this Section 2.07(c)(i), the Target NWCB  shall be
adjusted to (1) subtract any Preliminary Purchase Price Reduction  previously
paid to the Purchaser by the Escrow Agent or the Seller or (2)  add any
Preliminary Purchase Price Increase previously paid to the Seller  by the
Purchaser (as so adjusted, the "Adjusted Target NWCB")   (ii) Final Purchase
Price Adjustment. Each of the Closing  Statement of Net Assets, the Closing
Statement of Inventories and the  Receivables Reserve shall be deemed final
for the purposes of this  Section 2.07 upon the earliest of (x) the failure
of the Purchaser to  notify the Seller of a dispute within 30 Business Days
of the Seller\'s  delivery of the Closing Statement of Net Assets to the
Purchaser, (y)  the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to Section
2.07(b)(ii), by  the Seller\'s Accountants and the Purchaser\'s Accountants
and (z) the  resolution of all disputes, pursuant to Section 2.07(b)(ii),
relating  to the Closing Statement of Net Assets the Closing Statement of 
Inventories or the Receivables Reserve, as applicable, by the  Independent
Accounting Firm. Within five Business Days of both the  Closing Statement of
Net Assets and the Closing Statement of  Inventories being deemed final, the
Seller\'s Accountants shall, with  the agreement of the Purchaser\'s
Accountants, calculate the Final Net  Working Capital Balance and the
Purchase Price shall be finally  adjusted as follows:   (A) In the event
that the Final Net Working Capital Balance is less  than the Adjusted Target
NWCB, then the Purchaser shall deliver written  notice to the Escrow Agent
and the Seller specifying the amount of such  shortfall and the Escrow Agent
shall, within three Business Days of its  receipt of such notice and in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow  Agreement, pay to the Purchaser the
amount of such shortfall out of the  Escrow Fund by wire transfer in
immediately available funds. In the event  that the Escrow Fund is
insufficient to cover the amount of such shortfall,  then the Escrow Agent
shall distribute the entire Escrow Fund to the  Purchaser as provided above
and the Seller or Audiovox, on behalf of the  Seller, shall pay, on or prior
to the same date as the Escrow Agent  distributes the Escrow Fund to the
Purchaser, an amount to the Purchaser,  by wire transfer in immediately
available funds, equal to the amount of  such deficiency. No failure of the
Purchaser to deliver a notice of the  type specified in the immediately
preceding sentence shall relieve the  Seller of the obligation to pay the
amount of such deficiency to the  Purchaser.   (B) In the event that the
Final Net Working Capital Balance exceeds  the Adjusted Target NWCB, then the
Purchaser shall pay within three  Business Days of the Final Net Working
Capital Balance being calculated by  the Seller\'s Accountants, with the
agreement of the Purchaser\'s  Accountants, the amount of such excess to the
Seller by wire transfer    25        in immediately available
funds.   (d) Until the Closing Statement of Net Assets is deemed final
pursuant  to Section 2.07(c), the Purchaser shall respond to and process
warranty  claims in substantially the same manner in which the Seller
responded to  and processed warranty claims prior to the Closing, including
using the  same third party service providers used by the Seller and charging
actual  costs for in-house repairs (which costs shall be calculated
consistently  with how they were calculated by the Seller).   SECTION 2.08.
Escrow . Prior to the Closing, the Seller and the Purchaser shall enter into
an Escrow Agreement with the Escrow Agent substantially in the form of
Exhibit 2.08 (the "Escrow Agreement"). In accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, the Purchaser shall deposit the Escrow Amount at
the Closing, in an account to be managed and paid out by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.   SECTION 2.09.
Receivables .   (a) On or prior to 5:30 p.m. EST on the Business Day
immediately following the date on which the Closing occurs, the Seller shall
deliver to the Purchaser the Closing Statement of Receivables. Any amounts
paid by any Customer (or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries) to the
Purchaser (or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries), whether in respect of a
Receivable listed on the Receivables Listing or otherwise, shall, no later
than (i) in the case of a Receivable paid by wire transfer, the Business Day
following the day on which payment was received and (ii) in the case of a
Receivable paid other than by wire transfer, the third Business Day following
the day on which payment was received, be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Seller; provided, however that (i)
Purchaser shall have no obligation to pay over amounts received by
a particular Customer once the aggregate amount paid to the Seller and
the Purchaser by such Customer beginning on the Business Day following the
Closing equals the Per Customer Amount and (ii) if a Customer has given
notice to the Seller or the Purchaser that such Customer is disputing its
obligation to pay any amount of the Receivable listed on the Receivables
Listing as being owed by the Customer (to the extent such Receivable is
disputed, a "Disputed Receivable") or if a Receivable is deemed to be a
Disputed Receivable (as described below), the Purchaser shall not be
obligated to pay over amounts received from such Customer in excess of such
Customer\'s Per Customer Amount less the amount any Disputed Receivable. Any
Receivable not fully paid by a Customer by the date that is 25 days after the
date that such Receivable is due may be deemed by the Seller or the
Purchaser, upon written notice thereof, to the other party to be a Disputed
Receivable.   (b) Each of the Purchaser and the Seller shall give prompt
written notice to the other that it has received notice of a Disputed
Receivable. The Seller shall not initiate, or threaten to initiate, any legal
proceedings against a    26        Customer who is the obligor of a
Disputed Receivable to collect such Disputed Receivable until at least 15
Business Days following the date of the notice of the Disputed Receivable.
If, at the end of such 15 Business Day period, such Disputed Receivable has
not been paid to the Seller (either by the Customer or by the Purchaser on
behalf of such Customer), the Seller may take any and all legal actions it
believes are desirable to cause such Disputed Receivable to be paid to
it.   (c) Prior to 6 p.m. EST on each Business Day during the Collection 
Period (as hereinafter defined), the Purchaser and the Seller shall inform 
each other by email of the amount of payments that it has received from  each
Customer on such Business Day; provided, however that no information  need be
given with respect to any Customer once the Seller has received  from such
Customer the full amount of such Customer\'s Per Customer Amount.  All
amounts paid by a Customer, whether paid to the Seller directly or  remitted
to the Purchaser and then paid to the Seller shall be credited  against such
Customer\'s Per Customer Amount. In the event that, during the  120 day
period following the Closing, a Customer gives notice that a  Receivable set
forth on the Receivables Listing is a Disputed Receivable  and, had such
notice been given at an earlier date, the Purchaser would not  have been
obligated to pay to the Seller an amount pursuant to this Section  2.09 that
the Purchaser has paid over to the Seller, then the Seller shall  pay back to
the Purchaser the full amount disputed by such Customer within  three
Business Days by wire transfer of immediately available funds. For  120 days
after the Closing, the Purchaser shall direct and instruct its  relevant
employees to reasonably cooperate with the Seller in promptly  collecting all
Receivables and in resolving Disputed Receivables, in each  case, in a manner
consistent with the past practices of the Business.   (d) From and after the
Closing until the earlier of (x) the 90th  Business Day following the Closing
and (y) the date on which the Seller has  received full payment of all
Receivables reflected on the Receivables  Listing, net of the aggregate
Receivables Reserve and any Disputed  Receivables (such period, the
"Collection Period"), the Purchaser shall  not, and it shall cause its
Affiliates and representatives not to, take any  action that would reasonably
be expected to interfere with the Seller\'s  ability to promptly collect any
Receivable reflected on the Receivables  Listing, including, without
limitation, by suggesting or telling any  Customer that for any reason it
should not pay, or that it should delay  paying, the full amount of its
Receivable reflected on the Receivables  Listing.   (e) In the event that
the Receivables Reserve is adjusted upward  pursuant to Section 2.07(c), the
Purchaser shall give written notice to the  Seller of any Per Customer
Amounts paid over to the Seller by the Purchaser  in accordance with this
Section 2.09 prior to the Receivables Reserve  having been finally determined
that would be reduced by virtue of such  adjustment and the Seller shall pay
back to the Purchaser such excess Per  Customer Amounts (net of any amounts
that the Purchaser would be required  to pay to the Seller pursuant to this
Section 2.09(e)) within two Business  Days following such adjustment by wire
transfer of immediately available  funds. In the event that the Receivables
Reserve is adjusted downward  pursuant to Section 2.07(c), the Purchaser
shall pay over to the Seller  within two Business Days following such
adjustment any amounts that the  Purchaser would have been required to pay to
the Seller had the Receivables  Reserve been so adjusted immediately
following the Closing (net of any  amounts that the Seller would be required
to pay back to the Purchaser  pursuant to this Section 2.09(e)).   
27        SECTION 2.10. Inventories. On the day immediately following
the date of the Closing, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser the
Closing Statement of Inventories.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES  OF THE SELLER   As an inducement to the Purchaser to enter into

own and operate the properties and assets now owned and operated by it. The
Seller is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction which the properties leased by it or the operation of
its business makes such licensing or qualification necessary except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing will not result in a Material
Adverse Effect.   (b) Each of the Seller and Audiovox has the requisite
corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and, subject to receipt of
the vote of the Audiovox stockholders contemplated in Section 3.30(b) and the
approval of the Seller\'s stockholders, which has been obtained, perform this
Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements to be executed, delivered and
performed in connection with this Agreement, and except as set forth in
Sections 3.02 and 3.03, each of the Seller and Audiovox has all requisite
power and authority to transfer the Purchased Assets to the Purchaser. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each of the
Ancillary Agreements to which the Seller and Audiovox is a party, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been
duly authorized by all necessary action (corporate or otherwise) on the part
of the Seller and Audiovox (other than the vote of the Audiovox stockholders
contemplated in Section 3.30(b) and the approval of the Seller\'s
stockholders, which has been obtained). This Agreement has been, and upon
their execution and delivery the Ancillary Agreements shall have been, duly
and validly executed and delivered by the Seller and Audiovox, and (assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by the Purchaser) this Agreement
constitutes, and upon their execution and delivery the Ancillary Agreements
shall constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller and
Audiovox, enforceable against the Seller and Audiovox in accordance with
their respective terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors\' rights generally. No other corporate   
28       proceedings on the part of the Seller or Audiovox are
necessary to authorize this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (other
than the vote of the Audiovox stockholders contemplated in Section 3.30(b)
and the approval of the Seller\'s stockholders, which has been obtained).  
(c) There are no subsidiaries or Affiliates of Audiovox, other than
ACC, Quintex and ACCC, which own, lease or have the legal right to use, or
which are a party to and enjoy the right to the benefits of the Assumed
Contracts and other arrangements which constitute, the Purchased Assets.
Section 3.01(c) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth the subsidiaries of ACC
other than Quintex and ACCC. None of the entities set forth in Section
3.01(c) of the Disclosure Schedule have any assets. The liabilities of GLM
Wireless Communications, Inc. exceed its assets.   SECTION 3.02. No
Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements by each of the Seller and Audiovox do not and will not
(a) violate, conflict with or result in the breach of any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or similar organizational documents)
of the Seller or Audiovox, as the case may be, (b) conflict with or violate
any material Law or Governmental Order applicable to the Seller or Audiovox,
as the case may be, or any of its assets, properties or businesses, including

solely to the Purchaser), or (c) except as set forth in Section 3.02(c) of
the Disclosure Schedule, conflict with, result in any breach of, constitute
a default (or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or
both, would become a default) under, require any consent under, or give to
others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration, suspension,
revocation or cancellation of, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance
on any of the Purchased Assets pursuant to, any material note, bond, mortgage
or indenture, contract, agreement, lease, sublease, license, permit,
franchise or other instrument or arrangement to which the Seller or Audiovox
is a party or by which any of the Purchased Assets is bound or affected. The
Seller knows of no reason (except as may result from any facts or
circumstances relating solely to the Purchaser) why all consents set forth in
Section 3.02(c) of the Disclosure Schedule will not be received.   SECTION
3.03. Governmental Consents and Approvals . The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement by the Seller
do not and will not require any material consent, approval, authorization or
other order of, action by, filing with or notification to, any Governmental
Authority applicable to the Seller or Audiovox, except (a) as described in
Section 3.03 of the Disclosure Schedule and (b) the pre- merger notification
and waiting period requirements of the HSR Act. The Seller knows of no reason

representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers or directors, (y) the Seller
reasonably believes is necessary or advisable in connection with any claim
against the Seller or for which the Seller is purportedly responsible,
whether by a third party or otherwise or (z) the performance by the Seller of
its obligations, or the assertion by the Seller of any of its rights or
remedies, under any Acquisition Document; and provided further that, with
respect to Intellectual Property, specific information shall not be deemed to
be within the foregoing exception merely because it is embraced in general
disclosures in the public domain. In addition, with respect to Intellectual
Property, any combination of features shall not be deemed to be within the
foregoing exception merely because the individual features are in the public
domain unless the combination itself and its principle of operation are in
the public domain. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller and
its Affiliates may make such disclosures as are required under applicable
securities or state law or regulation or national stock exchange rules or
regulations. The     52       Seller agrees and acknowledges that
remedies at law for any breach of its obligations under this Section 5.03 are
inadequate and that in addition thereto the Purchaser shall be entitled to
seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, in the
event of any such breach.   SECTION 5.04. Regulatory and Other
Authorizations; Notices and Consents. (a) The Seller shall use its reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and
approvals of all third parties, including all Governmental Authorities and
officials that may be or become reasonably necessary for its execution and
delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and will cooperate fully with the
Purchaser in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents,
orders and approvals. Each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing,
if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days of the date
hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. The
filing fee for such HSR Act filing shall be borne by the Purchaser.   (b)
The Seller shall cooperate and use its reasonable commercial efforts
to obtain or assist the Purchaser in obtaining such third party consents
and estoppel certificates as may be reasonably necessary or desirable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (c) The
Purchaser shall cooperate and use all reasonable efforts to assist the Seller
in giving such notices and obtaining such consents and estoppel certificates;
provided, however, that the Purchaser shall have no obligation to give any
guarantee or other consideration of any nature in connection with any such
notice, consent or estoppel certificate or to consent to any change in
the terms of any agreement or arrangement which the Purchaser in its sole
discretion may deem adverse to the interests of the Purchaser or the
Business.   (d) The Seller and the Purchaser agree that, in the event that
any consent, approval or authorization reasonably necessary or desirable to
preserve for the Business any right or benefit under any Assumed Contract is
not obtained prior to the Closing, the Seller will, subsequent to the
Closing, cooperate with the Purchaser in attempting to obtain such consent,
approval or authorization as promptly thereafter as is reasonably
practicable. If such consent, approval or authorization cannot be obtained,
the Seller shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to provide the
Purchaser with, or cause to be provided to the Purchaser, the rights and
benefits of the affected Assumed Contract for the term of such Assumed
Contract. To the extent that any Assumed Contract is not capable of being
assigned, transferred, subleased or sublicensed without the consent or waiver
of the other party thereto or any third party including a government
or governmental unit, or if such assignment, transfer, sublease or sublicense
or attempted assignment, transfer, sublease or sublicense would constitute a
breach thereof or a violation of any law, decree, order, regulation, or
other governmental edict, this Agreement shall not constitute an assignment,
transfer, sublease or sublicense thereof, or an attempted assignment,
transfer, sublease or sublicense of any such Assumed Contract.   
53        (e) In using its reasonable commercial efforts to obtain any
authorization, order, consent, approval, assignment, estoppel certificate or
waiver hereunder, the Seller shall not be obligated to incur costs, expenses
(including third-party legal fees) and (collectively, "Consent Costs") which,
along with all other Consent Costs incurred by the Seller, (x) exceed
$500,000 in the aggregate and (y) are other than one-time costs to be paid in
connection with obtaining such authorization, order, consent, approval,
assignment or waiver. For the sake of clarity, Audiovox shall not have any
obligation to incur Consent Costs.   SECTION 5.05. Notice of Developments.
Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall promptly notify the Purchaser (a) in
writing of all events, circumstances, facts and occurrences arising
subsequent to the date of this Agreement which could reasonably be expected
to result in a failure to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 7.02(a)
and (b) all other material and adverse developments affecting the Purchased
Assets, Liabilities, business, financial condition, operations, results of
operations, customer or supplier relations, employee relations, projections
or prospects of the Business.   SECTION 5.06. No Solicitation or
Negotiation. (a) Each of the Seller and Audiovox agrees that neither it nor
any of its directors, officers or employees will, and that it will cause its
agents, advisors and other representatives (including, without limitation,
any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it), not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way
of furnishing nonpublic information), or take any other action to facilitate,
any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer (including, without
limitation, any proposal or offer to the stockholders of Audiovox) that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing
Transaction (as hereinafter defined), or (ii) enter into or maintain or
continue discussions or negotiations with any person or entity in
furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain a proposal or offer for a
Competing Transaction, or (iii) agree to, approve, endorse or recommend any
Competing Transaction or enter into any letter of intent or other contract,
agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any Competing
Transaction. The Seller or Audiovox, as applicable, shall notify the
Purchaser as promptly as practicable (and in any event within two (2) days
after the Seller or Audiovox, as applicable, attains knowledge thereof),
orally and in writing, if any proposal or offer, or any inquiry or contact
with any person with respect thereto, regarding a Competing Transaction is
made, specifying the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity
of the party making such proposal or offer or inquiry or contact (and the
Seller or Audiovox, as applicable, shall notify the Purchaser concerning any
material amendments to such proposal or offer). Audiovox shall provide the
Purchaser with forty-eight (48) hours prior notice (or such lesser prior
notice as is provided to the members of the Audiovox Board) of any meeting of
the Audiovox Board at which the Audiovox Board is reasonably expected to
consider any Competing Transaction. The Seller and Audiovox immediately shall
cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations
with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to a Competing
Transaction. The Seller and Audiovox agree not to, without the    
54       prior written consent of the Purchaser, release any Person
from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement
(unless the Audiovox Board, in order to comply with its fiduciary obligations
to Audiovox and its stockholders under applicable Law, must waive the
standstill provisions so that such Person may make a proposal or offer which
may reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal) to which the
Seller and Audiovox is a party relating to Audiovox, the Seller or the
Purchased Assets.   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
5.06, the Audiovox Board may furnish information to, and enter into
discussions with, a Person who has made an unsolicited, written, bona fide
proposal or offer regarding a Competing Transaction, and the Audiovox Board
has (i) determined, in its good faith judgment (after having received the
advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation), that such
proposal or offer constitutes, or may be reasonably expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal (as hereunder defined), (ii) determined, in its good faith
judgment after consultation with independent legal counsel (who may be
Audiovox\'s regularly engaged independent legal counsel), that, in light of
such proposal or offer, the furnishing of such information or entering into
discussions is required to comply with its fiduciary obligations to Audiovox
and its stockholders under applicable Law, (iii) provided written notice to
the Purchaser of its intent to furnish information or enter into discussions
with such person, and (iv) obtained from such person an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to Audiovox than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement and any related agreements shall not include any
provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate with such party or
having the effect of prohibiting Audiovox from satisfying its obligations
under this Agreement).   (c) Except as set forth in this Section 5.06(c),
neither the Audiovox Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or
modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the
Purchaser, the Audiovox Recommendation (a "Change in the Audiovox
Recommendation") or approve or recommend, or cause or permit Audiovox to
enter into any letter of intent, agreement or obligation with respect to, any
Competing Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Audiovox Board
determines, in its good faith judgment prior to the time of the Audiovox
Stockholders\' Meeting and after consultation with independent legal counsel
(who may be Audiovox\'s regularly engaged independent legal counsel), that it
is required to make a Change in the Audiovox Recommendation to comply with
its fiduciary obligations to Audiovox and its stockholders under
applicable Law, the Audiovox Board may make a Change in the Audiovox
Recommendation to recommend a Superior Proposal, but only (i) after providing
written notice to the Purchaser (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") advising
Audiovox that the Audiovox Board has received a Superior Proposal, specifying
the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying
the person making such Superior Proposal and indicating that the Audiovox
Board intends to effect a Change in the Audiovox Recommendation and the
manner in which it intends (or may intend) to do so, and (ii) if the
Purchaser does not, within three (3) business days of Purchaser\'s receipt of
the Notice of Superior Proposal, make an offer that the Audiovox Board
determines, in its good faith judgment (after having received the advice of a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be at least as
favorable to Audiovox\'s stockholders as such Superior Proposal. Any
disclosure that the Audiovox Board may determine that it is compelled to make
with respect to the receipt of a proposal or offer for a Competing
Transaction or otherwise in order to comply with its fiduciary obligations to
Audiovox and its stockholders under applicable Law, including    
55       under Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 of the rules promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, will not constitute a violation
of this Agreement.   (d) A "Competing Transaction" means any of the
following (other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement): (i)
any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving Audiovox or the Seller; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or
other disposition of all or a substantial part of the assets of Audiovox or
the Seller (other than a disposition of the assets of Audiovox that do not
comprise the Purchased Assets); (iii) any sale, exchange, transfer or other
disposition of 15% or more of any class of equity securities of Audiovox or
of the Seller; (iv) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated,
would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of
equity securities of Audiovox or of the Seller; or (v) any solicitation in
opposition to approval and adoption of this Agreement by
Audiovox\'s stockholders.   (e) A "Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited
written bona fide offer made by a third party to consummate any of the
following transactions: (i) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination or other similar transaction involving Audiovox or the Seller
pursuant to which the stockholders of Audiovox or the Seller, as the case may
be, immediately preceding such transaction would hold less than 50% of the
equity interest in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction;
(ii) the acquisition by any person or group (including by means of a tender
offer or an exchange offer or a two-step transaction involving a tender offer
followed with reasonable promptness by a cash-out merger involving Audiovox),
directly or indirectly, of ownership of 51% of the then outstanding shares of
stock of Audiovox or 90% of the then outstanding shares of stock of the
Seller, or (iii) an acquisition of 85% of the assets of the Seller, in each
case on terms (including conditions to consummation of the
contemplated transaction) that the Audiovox Board determines, in its good
faith judgment (after having received the advice of a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation), to be more favorable to Audiovox
stockholders than transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that any such offer shall not be deemed to be a "Superior Proposal"
if any financing required to consummate the transaction contemplated by such
offer is not committed and is not likely in the good faith judgment of the
Audiovox Board (after having received the advice of a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) to be obtained by such third party on a
timely basis.   SECTION 5.07. Use of Intellectual Property. From and after
the Closing, neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall use any of
the Owned Intellectual Property or any of the Licensed Intellectual Property,
except for the Excluded Assets.   SECTION 5.08. Non-Competition. (a) For a
period of five years after the Closing (the "Restricted Period"), neither the
Seller nor Audiovox shall    56       conduct, directly or
indirectly, the Business or, without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser, directly or indirectly, own an interest in, manage, operate,
control, as a partner, stockholder or otherwise, any Person that conducts the
Business; provided, however, that, (x) for the purposes of this Section 5.08,
ownership of securities having no more than five percent of the outstanding
voting power of any such Person shall not be deemed to be in violation of
this Section 5.08 as long as the Person owning such securities has no other
material connection or relationship with, and no express ability to effect
the management of, such other Person and (y) ownership of a Person hereafter
acquired by the Seller or Audiovox that conducts the Business shall not be
deemed a violation of this Section 5.08, provided, that (1) such Person is
not engaged primarily in conducting the Business, (2) if Audiovox or
the Seller, as the case may be, causes that Person to cease conducting the
Business within six months of Audiovox or the Seller becoming the owner of
such Person and (3) such Person shall not use the Audiovox name to promote
the Business during such period of ownership by Audiovox or the Seller; and
provided, further, that the ownership interests described in Section 5.08(a)
of the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be in violation of this
Section 5.08.   (b) As a separate and independent covenant, the Seller
agrees with the Purchaser that, for a period of five years following the
Closing, neither the Seller nor Audiovox will in any way, directly or
indirectly, materially interfere with or attempt to materially interfere with
any officers, employees, representatives or agents of the Business or solicit
or attempt to solicit any employee of the Purchaser to leave the employ of
the Purchaser or violate the terms of their contracts, or any employment
arrangements, with the Purchaser; provided, however, that the foregoing will
not prohibit a general solicitation to the public.   (c) The Restricted
Period shall be extended by the length of any period during which the Seller
or Audiovox is in breach of the terms of this Section 5.08.   (d) The
Seller acknowledges that the covenants of the Seller set forth in this
Section 5.08 are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but for the
agreement of the Seller to comply with these covenants, the Purchaser
would not have entered into this Agreement. The Seller acknowledges that this
Section 5.08 constitutes an independent covenant that shall not be affected
by performance or nonperformance of any other provision of this Agreement by
the Purchaser. The Seller has independently consulted with its counsel and
after such consultation agrees that the covenants set forth in this Section
5.08 are reasonable and proper.   SECTION 5.09. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.  
SECTION 5.10. Bulk Transfer Laws. The Purchaser hereby waives compliance
by the Seller with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer laws of
any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets to
the    57       Purchaser (other than any obligations with respect
to the application of the proceeds therefrom). The Seller agrees to indemnify
the Purchaser in accordance with Article VIII against any and all liabilities
(including any liabilities for Taxes of Seller as a transferee or otherwise)
which may be asserted by third parties against the Purchaser as a result of
the Seller\'s noncompliance with any such law.   SECTION 5.11. Inter-
company Arrangements. Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall cause any
contract or arrangement that is disclosed (or should have been disclosed) in
Section 3.14(a)(viii) of the Disclosure Schedule, other than the Inter-
company Payables and those contracts or arrangements set forth in
Section 5.11 of the Disclosure Schedule, to be terminated.   SECTION 5.12.
Payments on Behalf of Affiliates . Payments made or received by the Purchaser
pursuant to Article II, this Article V or Article VIII hereof shall, in
appropriate circumstances, be made on behalf of, or received in trust for the
benefit of, the relevant Affiliate of the Purchaser. The Purchaser may direct
in writing any such payment to be made by or to the appropriate Affiliate,
and the Seller shall comply with any such direction received at least two
Business Days prior to the date such payment is due.   SECTION 5.13.
Transition Services . Following the Closing, the Seller shall provide, or
cause to be provided, to the Business certain services that are currently
provided by the Seller and its Affiliates to the Business, all in accordance
with the transition services agreement substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit 5.13 (the "Transition Services Agreement") to be entered
into by the Seller and the Purchaser as of the Closing.   SECTION 5.14. Tax
Cooperation and Exchange of Information . Upon the terms set forth in Section
5.02 of this Agreement, the Seller and the Purchaser shall provide each other
with such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may
request of the other in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim
for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund
of Taxes, participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in
respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include providing
copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with
accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents in their possession
relating to rulings or other determinations by Tax authorities. The Seller
and the Purchaser shall make themselves (and shall direct and instruct their
respective employees to be)    58       available on a basis
mutually convenient to both parties to provide explanations of any documents
or information provided under this Section 5.14. Each of the Seller and the
Purchaser shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records
and other documents in its possession (or in the possession of its
Affiliates) relating to Tax matters relevant to the Purchased Assets or
the Business for each taxable period first ending after the Closing and for
all prior taxable periods until the later of (a) the expiration of the
statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and
other documents relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent
notified by the other party in writing of such extensions for the respective
Tax periods, or (b) six years following the due date (without extension) for
such Tax Returns. After such time, before the Seller or the Purchaser shall
dispose of any such documents in its possession (or in the possession of its
Affiliates), the other party shall be given the opportunity, after 90 days\'
prior written notice, to remove and retain all or any part of such documents
as such other party may select (at such other party\'s expense). Any
information obtained under this Section 5.14 shall be kept confidential in
accordance with Section 5.03, except as may be otherwise necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in
conducting an audit or other proceeding.   The Purchaser shall, in
accordance with Section 5.02(b), make available the Transferred Employees and
direct and instruct such Transferred Employees to cooperate with the Seller
in the resolution of any Tax claims made against or incurred by the Seller
prior to the Closing.   SECTION 5.15. Conveyance Taxes . The Seller shall be
liable for and shall hold the Purchaser harmless against any Conveyance Taxes
which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Seller, after the review and consent by the Purchaser, shall
file such applications and documents as shall permit any such Conveyance Tax
to be assessed and paid on or prior to the Closing in accordance with any
available pre-sale filing procedure. The Purchaser shall execute and deliver
all instruments and certificates necessary to enable the Seller to comply
with the foregoing. The Purchaser shall complete and execute resale or other
exemption certificates, if available, with respect to the Purchased Assets
acquired hereunder, and shall provide the Seller with executed copies
thereof. The Purchaser will use its reasonable commercial efforts to
cooperate with the Seller to take all actions reasonably necessary
or desirable in order to exempt the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement from any GST and PST taxes in Canada and in the Province of
Ontario.   SECTION 5.16. Further Action . (a) If, after the Closing, the
Seller becomes aware of, or the Purchaser brings to the attention of the
Seller, any assets of the Seller that should have been transferred as of the
Closing but were not so transferred, then such assets shall be transferred to
the Purchaser (or to one or more Affiliates of the Purchaser designated by
the Purchaser) as soon as possible. This provision, however, shall not limit,
in any way, the rights and remedies of the Purchaser under this
Agreement.    59          (b) Each of the parties hereto shall use
all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action,
do or cause to be done all things reasonably necessary under applicable Law,
and to execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be
required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party and consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.   SECTION 5.17. INTENTIONALLY
OMITTED.   SECTION 5.18. Proration of Taxes and Certain Charges . (a) Except
as provided in Section 5.15, all Property Taxes levied with respect to
the Purchased Assets for any Straddle Period, whether imposed or assessed in
the Pre-Closing Tax Period or Post-Closing Tax Period, shall be prorated
between the Seller and the Purchaser as of 12:01 A.M. on the day after the
date of the Closing. If any Taxes subject to proration are paid by Purchaser,
on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, the proportionate amount of
such Taxes paid (or in the event a refund of any portion of such Taxes
previously paid is received, such refund) shall be paid promptly by (or to)
the other after the payment of such Taxes (or promptly following the receipt
of any such refund).   (b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
all installments of special assessments or other charges on or with respect
to the Purchased Assets payable by the Seller for any period in which the
Closing shall occur, including, without limitation, base rent, common area
maintenance, royalties, all municipal, utility or authority charges for
water, sewer, electric or gas charges, garbage or waste removal, and cost of
fuel, shall be apportioned as of the Closing and each party shall pay its
proportionate share promptly upon the receipt of any bill, statement or other
charge with respect thereto. If such charges or rates are assessed either
based upon time or for a specified period, such charges or rates shall be
prorated between the Seller and the Purchaser as of the 12:01 A.M. on the day
after the date of the Closing. If such charges or rates are assessed based
upon usage of utility or similar services, such charges shall be prorated
based upon meter readings taken on the date of the Closing.   (c) All
refunds, reimbursements, installments of base rent, additional rent, license
fees or other use related revenue receivable by any party to the extent
attributable to the operation of the Business for any period in which
the Closing shall occur shall be prorated so that the Seller shall be
entitled to that portion of any such installment applicable to any period
from and after the day after the date of the Closing, and if Purchaser or
Seller, as the case may be, shall receive any such payments after the date of
the Closing, they shall promptly remit to such other parties their share of
such payments.   (d) The prorations pursuant to this Section 5.18 may be
calculated after     60       the Closing, as each item to be
prorated (including without limitation any such Tax, obligation, assessment,
charge, refund, reimbursement, rent installment, fee or revenue) accrues or
comes due, provided that, in any event, any such proration shall be
calculated not later than thirty (30) days after the party requesting
proration of any item obtains the information required to calculate such
proration.   SECTION 5.19. Proxy Statement . (a) As promptly as practicable
after the execution of this Agreement, Audiovox shall prepare and file with
the SEC the proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of Audiovox
relating to the meeting of the Audiovox stockholders (the "Audiovox
Stockholders\' Meeting") to be held to consider approval and adoption of this
Agreement or any information statement to be sent to such stockholders, as
appropriate (such proxy statement or information statement, as amended or
supplemented, being referred to herein as the "Proxy Statement"). The Seller
shall furnish all information concerning the Seller as Audiovox may
reasonably request in connection with such actions and the preparation of the
Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, Audiovox shall mail the Proxy Statement to its stockholders.  
(b) Except as provided in Section 5.06(c), Audiovox covenants that none
of the Audiovox Board or any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or
propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Purchaser, the
approval or recommendation by the Audiovox Board or any committee thereof of
this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Proxy Statement shall include, the recommendation to the stockholders of
Audiovox in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement and approval of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Audiovox
Recommendation").   (c) Audiovox will advise the Purchaser, promptly after
it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for amendment of the
Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the
SEC for additional information.   (d) Audiovox represents that the
information in the Proxy Statement shall not, at (i) the time the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to
the stockholders of Audiovox, (ii) the time of the Audiovox Stockholders\'
Meeting and (iii) the Closing, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or fail to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. All documents
that Audiovox is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will comply
as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the
rules and regulations thereunder.   SECTION 5.20. Audiovox Stockholders\'
Meeting . Audiovox shall, subject only to such delays as are necessary to
enable the Audiovox Board to discharge its    61       fiduciary
obligations in determining whether any unsolicited offer or
proposal regarding a Competing Transaction constitutes a Superior Proposal in
accordance with Section 5.06 hereof, (i) call and hold the Audiovox
Stockholders\' Meeting as promptly as practicable for the purpose of voting
upon the approval and adoption of this Agreement and Audiovox shall use its
reasonable best efforts to hold the Audiovox Stockholders\' Meeting as soon
as practicable after the date of this Agreement and (ii) use its reasonable
best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and shall take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the required vote or consent of its
stockholders.   SECTION 5.21. Trademark License Agreement . Concurrently
with the Closing, Audiovox and the Purchaser shall enter into a trademark
license agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 5.21
(the "Trademark License Agreement").   SECTION 5.22. Replication Service .
On or prior to the Closing, Audiovox and the Seller shall replicate, for the
Purchaser, all Developed Software, which, together with the Shared MIS
Systems, Owned Intellectual Property and Licensed Intellectual Property, will
enable the Business to become a fully operational entity with all current
functionality and appropriate controls to protect the Business from any non-
Business access (the "Replication Service"). All hardware brands and
configurations used in the Replication Service shall be approved by the
Purchaser prior to such use. The Purchaser shall pay $70,000 for the
Replication Service but in no event shall the Purchaser be obligated to
make any other payments in respect of the Replication Service or the
resulting replicated environment.   SECTION 5.23. Limited Updating of
Disclosure Schedules . At the Closing, the Seller shall, to the extent
necessary, update Sections 3.07(b), 3.12(b), 3.14(a), 3.14(b), 3.15(a),
3.16(c), 3.17(a) and 3.26 of the Disclosure Schedule (provided, that, in the
case of Section 3.14(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, the Seller may only
update the disclosure as to contracts which are no longer in full force and
effect due to their expiration or termination in accordance with their terms)
to reflect information arising after the date of this Agreement and the
updating of such Sections of the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed
to be a breach of the representations and warranties which such disclosures
modify except to the extent that (i) the actions giving rise to such
updating constitute a breach of Section 5.01 hereof or (ii) the additional
information disclosed would have a Material Adverse Effect.      
62        SECTION 5.24. Leases. Audiovox and the Purchaser shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to negotiate and agree upon the form of the 555
Wireless Sublease within 45 days after the date of this Agreement. The
Purchaser shall use reasonable commercial efforts to negotiate and agree upon
the form of the Cerritos Lease within 45 days after the date of this
Agreement.   SECTION 5.25. Section 404 Compliance . (a) Promptly after the
date of this Agreement, the Seller shall retain the Seller\'s Reporting
Controls Advisors, as outside advisors, to work with the Seller to develop
and implement the ACC Internal Reporting Controls and to satisfy the Interim
Milestones. The Seller shall use its best efforts to (i) satisfy the Interim
Milestones and (ii) develop and implement the ACC Internal Reporting Controls
prior to September 30, 2004. The Purchaser and the Purchaser\'s Reporting
Controls Advisors shall work cooperatively with the Seller and the Seller\'s
Reporting Controls Advisors to provide necessary information on a timely
basis to the Seller concerning the UTSI Internal Reporting Controls to enable
the Seller to develop and implement the ACC Internal Reporting Controls, meet
the Interim Milestones and satisfy the condition set forth in Section
7.02(j). All costs and expenses of the Seller and the Seller\'s Reporting
Controls Advisors relating to the development and implementation of the ACC
Internal Reporting Controls shall be borne by the Seller.   (b) In the
event that the Purchaser shall not have made the Determination of
Satisfactory Controls by September 30, 2004, the Purchaser and the
Seller agree that the Seller shall no longer be obligated hereunder to
develop and implement the ACC Internal Reporting Controls.   ARTICLE VI  
EMPLOYEE MATTERS   SECTION 6.01. Offer of Employment . As of the Closing,
the Purchaser shall offer employment to each of the then-current employees of
the Seller listed on Section 6.01 of the Disclosure Schedule providing for
employee benefits (other than equity compensation arrangements) on terms that
are no less favorable than the terms and conditions applicable to similarly
situated employees of the Purchaser, it being understood that such employees
shall receive credit for all prior periods of service with the Seller for
purposes of participation in compensation and employee benefit plans,
programs or arrangements of the Purchaser; provided, however, that such
crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the
funding of any such benefit. At Closing, Purchaser shall hire all employees
who accept such offer of employment. As used herein, "Transferred Employee"
shall mean each employee who accepts such offer. In addition, the Purchaser
agrees to (i) credit each of the Transferred Employees with a number of paid
vacation, sick leave and personal days immediately following the date of
Closing equal to the number of such days each such Transferred Employee has
accrued but not used as of the date of Closing     63       under
the applicable policies of the Seller as in effect immediately prior to the
date of Closing, and (ii) allow each of the Transferred Employees to use such
days following the date of Closing in accordance with the applicable policies
of the Purchaser as are in effect from time to time. The Purchaser and Seller
shall undertake in good faith to consider the preparation and filing
of employment tax reports with respect to the Transferred Employees using
the alternative procedure set forth in Revenue Procedure 96-60 under the
Code.   ARTICLE VII   CONDITIONS TO CLOSING   SECTION 7.01. Conditions

Audiovox to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be subject to the fulfillment or written waiver by Audiovox or the Seller, at

Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The representations and 
warranties of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall have been  true
and correct when made and shall be true and correct at and as of the  Closing
(disregarding for these purposes any materiality or corollary  qualifications
contained therein), except to the extent that any failures  of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not  have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, except to the extent such  representations
and warranties are as of another date, in which case, such  representations
and warranties shall be true and correct as of that date  with the same force
and effect as if made as of the Closing except to the  extent that any
failures of such representations and warranties to be true  and correct that
would not have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, and  the covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement to be complied  with by the Purchaser
on or before the Closing shall have been complied  with in all material
respects;   (b) HSR Act. Any waiting period (and any extension thereof)

Action shall have been commenced  by or before any Governmental Authority
against any of Audiovox, the Seller  or the Purchaser, seeking to restrain or

Agreement which, in the reasonable, good  faith determination of the Seller,
is likely to render it impossible or  unlawful to consummate such
transactions; provided, however, that the  provisions of this Section 7.01(c)
shall not apply if the Seller has  directly or indirectly solicited or
encouraged any such Action; and   (d) Audiovox Stockholders\' Approval. This
Agreement and the     64        transactions contemplated by this
Agreement have been approved and adopted  by the requisite affirmative vote
of the stockholders of Audiovox in  accordance with the General Corporation

the Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be subject to the fulfillment or written waiver by the

representations and  warranties of the Seller and Audiovox contained in this
Agreement shall  have been true and correct when made and shall be true and
correct at and  as of the Closing (disregarding for these purposes any
materiality,  Material Adverse Effect or corollary qualifications contained
therein),  except to the extent that any failures of such representations
and  warranties to be so true and correct would not have a Material Adverse 
Effect, except to the extent such representations and warranties are as of 
another date, in which case, such representations and warranties shall be 
true and correct as of that date with the same force and effect as if made 
as of the Closing except to the extent that any failures of such 
representations and warranties to be true and correct that would not have a 
Material Adverse Effect, and the covenants and agreements contained in this 
Agreement to be complied with by the Seller and Audiovox on or before the

Agreement shall have expired or shall have been terminated and the PRC 
Antitrust Approvals have been received];   (c) No Proceeding or Litigation.
No Action shall have been commenced  by or before any Governmental Authority
against any of Audiovox, the Seller  or the Purchaser, seeking to restrain or
materially and adversely alter the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement which, in the reasonable, good  faith determination of the
Purchaser, is likely to render it impossible or  unlawful to consummate such
transactions or which is reasonably likely to  have a Material Adverse
Effect; provided, however, that the provisions of  this Section 7.02(c) shall
not apply if the Purchaser has directly or  indirectly solicited or
encouraged any such Action;   (d) Governmental Consents and Approvals. The
Purchaser and the Seller  shall have received, each in form and substance

Section 7.02(e)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, the Purchaser or  Seller shall
have received either (x) consent that such agreement may be  assigned to the
Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement
or (y) the opportunity to enter into a new agreement that  is, in the
aggregate, not materially less favorable to Purchaser than, on  the date of
the Closing, is the agreement that it is replacing. With  respect to three of
the five agreements listed in Section 7.02(e)(ii) of  the Disclosure
Schedule, the Purchaser or Seller shall have received (x)  consent that such
agreement may be assigned to the Purchaser in connection  with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y) the opportunity  to enter
into a new agreement that is, in the aggregate, not materially  less
favorable to Purchaser than, on the date of the Closing, is the  agreement
that it is replacing.   (f) Employment Agreements. The Employment Agreement
shall have been  validly entered into and shall be in full force and effect
and Philip  Christopher shall, as of Closing, become an employee of the
Purchaser; and   (g) Key Employees. At least 80% of the key employees listed

become employees  of the Purchaser.   (h) Audiovox Stockholders\' Approval.
This Agreement and the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been
approved and adopted  by the requisite affirmative vote of the stockholders
of Audiovox in  accordance with the General Corporation Law of Delaware, and
Audiovox\'s  certificate of incorporation, and such approval shall not have
been  rescinded, revoked or otherwise withdrawn.   (i) Leases. (i) Audiovox
and the Purchaser shall have entered into a  sublease agreement (the "555

Compliance. The Purchaser shall have made the  Determination of Satisfactory
Controls on or before September 30, 2004;  provided, that, from and after

Purchaser\'s obligation to consummate the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement      66     ARTICLE VIII   INDEMNIFICATION   SECTION
8.01. Survival of Representations and Warranties . (a) The representations
and warranties of the Seller and Audiovox contained in this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements shall survive the Closing until the second anniversary
of the Closing; provided, however, that (i) the representations and
warranties made pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.29 shall survive indefinitely
and (ii) the representations and warranties dealing with Tax matters shall
survive until 120 days after the expiration of the relevant statute of
limitations for the Tax liabilities in question. Neither the period of
survival nor the liability of the Seller and Audiovox with respect to
the Seller\'s and Audiovox\'s representations and warranties shall be reduced
by any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of the Purchaser. If
written notice of a claim has been given prior to the expiration of the
applicable representations and warranties by the Purchaser to the Seller and
Audiovox, then the relevant representations and warranties shall survive as
to such claim, until such claim has been finally resolved.   (b) The
representations and warranties of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements shall survive the Closing until the second
anniversary of the Closing. Neither the period of survival nor the liability
of the Purchaser with respect to the Purchaser\'s representations
and warranties shall be reduced by any investigation made at any time by or
on behalf of the Seller. If written notice of a claim has been given prior to
the expiration of the applicable representations and warranties by the Seller
to the Purchaser, then the relevant representations and warranties shall
survive as to such claim, until such claim has been finally resolved.  
SECTION 8.02. Indemnification by the Seller and Audiovox . If the
Closing shall occur, the Purchaser and its Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns (each a "Purchaser Indemnified
Party") shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Seller and Audiovox, on
a joint and several basis, for and against any and all Liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs and expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties (including attorneys\' and consultants\' fees and expenses)
actually suffered or incurred by them (including any Action brought or
otherwise initiated by any of them) (hereinafter a "Loss"), arising out of or
resulting from:   (a) the breach of any representation or warranty made by
the Seller contained in the Acquisition Documents;   (b) the breach of any
covenant or agreement by the Seller contained in the Acquisition
Documents;   (c) any claim or cause of action of any third party relating to
any action, inaction, event, condition, liability or obligation of the Seller
occurring or existing prior to the Closing (other than the Assumed
Liabilities); and   (d) the Excluded Liabilities.   To the extent that the
Seller\'s or Audiovox\'s undertakings set forth in this Section 8.02 may be
unenforceable, the Seller or Audiovox, as the case may    
67       be, shall contribute the maximum amount that it is permitted
to contribute under applicable Law to the payment and satisfaction of all
Losses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, provided, that, in no
event shall the Seller\'s or Audiovox\'s liability exceed the amounts set
forth in Section 8.04 hereof.   SECTION 8.03. Indemnification by the
Purchaser . If the Closing shall occur, the Seller and its Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (each a
"Seller Indemnified Party") shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Purchaser for and against any and all Losses, arising out of or resulting
from:   (a) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Purchaser contained in the Acquisition Documents;   (b) the breach of any
covenant or agreement by the Purchaser contained in the Acquisition
Documents;   (c) Liabilities, whether arising before or after the Closing,
that are expressly assumed by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement,
including the Assumed Liabilities;   (d) Taxes, other than the Excluded
Taxes, relating to the Purchased Assets, the Business or the Assumed
Liabilities for any Post-Closing Tax Period;   (e) claims arising after the
Closing made by Transferred Employees relating to their employment with the
Purchaser; and   (f) any claim or cause of action by any third party
relating to any action, inaction, event, condition, liability or obligation
relating to the operation of the Business from and after the Closing.   To
the extent that the Purchaser\'s undertakings set forth in this Section 8.03
may be unenforceable, the Purchaser shall contribute the maximum amount that
it is permitted to contribute under applicable Law to the payment
and satisfaction of all Losses incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties,
provided, that, in no event shall the Purchaser\'s liability exceed the
amounts set forth in Section 8.04 hereof.   SECTION 8.04. Limitation on
Obligation to Indemnify . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement:   (a) an Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any claim
for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.02(a) or 8.02(b) hereof, as
applicable, only to the extent, and for the amount, that the aggregate amount
of indemnifiable Losses are in excess of $500,000; provided that, in
determining the amount of such indemnifiable Losses (but not the breach
thereof giving rise to indemnification) each representation shall be read
without regard to any materiality, Material    68       Adverse
Effect or corollary qualifications contained therein;   (b) in no event
shall the obligations of all Indemnifying Parties, in the aggregate, to
indemnify the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VIII exceed: (i) 30%
of the Purchase Price with respect to Losses arising from breaches of any
representation or warranty made by the Indemnifying Party contained in the
Acquisition Documents and (ii) 50% of the Purchase Price with respect to all
Losses (including those covered in clause (i) above); and   (c) the amount
of Losses for which the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify
the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VIII shall be reduced by any
amount received under any insurance policy by the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Losses.   SECTION 8.05. Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims .
(a) An Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of any
matter which an Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise
to a right of indemnification under this Article VIII, promptly, but in any
event, within 20 days of such determination, stating the amount of the Loss,
if known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to
the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of
indemnification is claimed or arises; provided, however, that the failure to
provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure and shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any other obligation or Liability that it
may have to any Indemnified Party otherwise than under this Article VIII.  
(b) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action, audit, demand
or assessment (each, a "Third Party Claim") against it or which may give rise
to a claim for Loss under this Article VIII, promptly, but in any
event, within 20 days of the receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party
shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third Party Claim; provided,
however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article VIII except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such
failure and shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any other
obligation or Liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party otherwise
than under this Article VIII. If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in
writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder against
any Losses that may result from such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party
Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice if it gives notice of
its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within five days of the
receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that if
there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that, in
the opinion of the Indemnified Party\'s counsel (a copy of which shall be
given to the Indemnifying Party), would make it inappropriate in the
reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party for the same counsel to
represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel in
each jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party determines counsel is
required, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party     69       exercises the right to undertake
any such defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided above, the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party\'s
expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Indemnified Party\'s possession or under the Indemnified Party\'s control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party.
Similarly, in the event the Indemnified Party is, directly or
indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Party\'s
expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the
Indemnifying Party\'s possession or under the Indemnifying Party\'s control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. No such
Third Party Claim may be settled by the Indemnifying Party without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party which shall not be unreasonably
withheld unless such settlement shall involve only the payment of money with
no admission of wrongdoing. In no event may an Indemnified Party settle any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party.   SECTION 8.06. Distributions from Escrow Fund . The Escrow Agent
shall deliver to the Purchaser from the Escrow Fund any amount determined to
be owed to the Purchaser under this Article VIII in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement. For the purposes of clarity, to the extent that there is a
shortfall between the amount owed by the Seller to the Purchaser in respect
of the indemnification amount and the Escrow Fund, the Seller and Audiovox,
jointly and severally, shall be obligated to pay the Purchaser any such
shortfall from its own account, subject to the limitations of this Article
VIII.   SECTION 8.07. Other Provisions . The indemnification provided in
this Article VIII shall be, except in the case of fraudulent
misrepresentation, the sole and exclusive remedy for any of the matters set
forth in Sections 8.02 and 8.03. In no event shall the Seller or the
Purchaser be liable for loss of profits or consequential damages incurred by
the Purchaser or the Seller, respectively, or any of its respective
Affiliates. Upon making any payment to an Indemnified Party for any
indemnification claim under this Agreement or any Acquisition Document, the
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any
rights which the Indemnifying Party or its Affiliates may have against other
Persons (including under any insurance policies) with respect to the subject
matter underlying such indemnification claim. The Indemnified Party and its
Affiliates shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in pursuit of such
rights and shall promptly turn over to the Indemnifying Party any payments
received in respect of such rights.   SECTION 8.08. Tax Treatment . The
Seller and the Purchaser agree that all payments made by any of the Seller
and Audiovox on the one hand and the   70       Purchaser on the
other hand to or for the benefit of the other under this Article VIII, under
other indemnity provisions of this Agreement and for any misrepresentations
or breaches of warranties or covenants shall be treated as adjustments to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes and that such treatment shall govern for
purposes hereof except to the extent that the Laws of a
particular jurisdiction provide otherwise, in which case such payments shall
be made in an amount sufficient to indemnify the relevant party on an after-
Tax basis.   ARTICLE IX   TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER   SECTION
9.01. Termination . This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:   (a) by (i) the Purchaser if between the date hereof and the
Closing  any representations, warranties or covenants of the Seller contained
in  this Agreement shall have become untrue or incorrect such that Section 
7.02(a) could not be satisfied or (ii) by the Seller or Audiovox if,  between
the date hereof and the Closing any representations, warranties or  covenants
of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall have become  untrue or
incorrect such that Section 7.01(a) could not be satisfied;   (b) by either
the Seller or the Purchaser if the Closing shall not  have occurred by
December 15, 2004 (as such date shall be extended to  January 15, 2005,
solely in the event that the condition set forth in  Section 7.02(j) shall
fail to have been satisfied or waived) (either such  date being, as
applicable, the "Initial Termination Date); provided,  however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section  9.01(b) shall not be
available to any party whose failure to fulfill any  obligation under this
Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have  resulted in, the
failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date;  provided, further,
that at any time after the Initial Termination Date, if  the PRC Antitrust
Approvals have not been received, and at such time the  Seller and Audiovox
have satisfied their conditions to Closing and are  otherwise in all respects
prepared to close the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement, then (i)
the Seller may terminate this Agreement and  within two Business Days
following such termination the Purchaser shall pay  to the Seller by wire
transfer of immediately available funds $1,000,000 as  reimbursement for the
Seller\'s expenses (the "Expense Reimbursement") and  (ii) the Purchaser may
not terminate this Agreement; provided, further,  that, at any time after
February 15, 2005, the Purchaser may terminate this  Agreement if on the date
of such termination the Purchaser shall pay to the  Seller by wire transfer
of immediately available funds the Expense  Reimbursement.   (c) by either
the Seller or the Purchaser in the event that any  Governmental Authority
shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or  taken any other action
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling  or other
action shall have become final and nonappealable;    71        (d)
by the Purchaser if an Audiovox Triggering Event (as defined  below) shall
have occurred;   (e) by the Purchaser or Audiovox or the Seller if this
Agreement shall  fail to receive the requisite vote for approval at the
Audiovox  Stockholders\' Meeting; provided, that neither Audiovox nor the
Seller shall  be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause
(e) if the  Stockholder shall have breached the Voting Agreement; or   (f)
by Audiovox or the Seller if the Audiovox Board shall have  recommended a
Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 5.06(c) or in  order to enter
into a definitive agreement relating to a Superior Proposal;  or   (g) by
the mutual written consent of the Seller and the Purchaser.  For purposes of
this Agreement, an "Audiovox Triggering Event" shall be deemed to have
occurred if: (i) the Audiovox Board makes a Change in the
Audiovox Recommendation; (ii) the Audiovox Board shall have recommended to
the stockholders of Audiovox a Competing Transaction or shall have resolved
to do so; (iii) Audiovox shall have failed to include in the Proxy Statement
the Audiovox Recommendation; (iv) the Audiovox Board fails to reaffirm the
Audiovox Recommendation within seven Business Days after the Purchaser
reasonably requests in writing that such recommendation be reaffirmed; or (v)
Audiovox shall have intentionally breached its obligations under Section
5.06.   SECTION 9.02. Effect of Termination . In the event of termination of
this Agreement as provided in Section 9.01, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and there shall be no liability on the part of either party
hereto except (a) as set forth in Sections 5.03 and 9.03, (b) that nothing
herein shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this
Agreement and (c) the Purchaser shall promptly return or destroy (and cause
its agents and representatives to return or destroy) all documents (and
copies thereof) relating to the Business that were furnished to the Purchaser
and all excerpts therefrom and notes related thereto.   SECTION 9.03.
Expenses . (a) Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, all costs and
expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and
accountants, incurred in connection with this Agreement ("Expenses") and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such Expenses, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred.  
(b) Audiovox agrees that:   (i) if the Purchaser shall terminate this
Agreement pursuant to  Section 9.01(d); or    72        (ii) if
Audiovox or the Seller shall terminate this Agreement pursuant  to Section
9.01(f).  then Audiovox shall pay to the Purchaser promptly (but in any
event no later than one business day after the first of such events shall
have occurred) a fee of 3.5% of the Purchase Price (the "Fee"), which amount
shall be payable in immediately available funds, plus an amount equal to the
amount of the Purchaser\'s Expenses, up to a maximum of $1,000,000.   (c)
Audiovox acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.03 are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the
event that Audiovox shall fail to pay the Fee or any Expenses when due,
the term "Expenses" shall be deemed to include the costs and expenses
actually incurred or accrued by the Purchaser (including, without limitation,
fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and
enforcement of this Section 9.03, together with interest on such unpaid Fee
and Expenses, commencing on the date that the Fee or such Expenses became
due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank,
N.A., from time to time, in The City of New York, as such bank\'s Prime Rate
plus 1.00 %. Payment of the fees and expenses described in this Section 9.03
shall not be in lieu of any damages incurred in the event of willful or
intentional breach of this Agreement.   SECTION 9.04. Amendment . This
Agreement may not be amended or modified except (a) by an instrument in
writing signed by, or on behalf of, the Seller, Audiovox and the Purchaser or
(b) by a waiver in accordance with Section 9.05.   SECTION 9.05. Waiver .
Any term or condition to this Agreement may be waived, or the time for the
performance of any of the obligations may be extended, at any time by the
party that is entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be
construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the
same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this
Agreement. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights
hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights. Except as
otherwise set forth in this Agreement, all rights and remedies existing
under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or
remedies otherwise available.    73        ARTICLE X   GENERAL

10.05. Assignment . This Agreement may not be assigned by operation of law or
otherwise without the express written consent of the Seller and the Purchaser
(which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of the
Seller or the Purchaser); provided, however, that the Purchaser may

but, notwithstanding such assignment, the Purchaser shall remain fully

permitted by applicable law any right it may have to a trial by jury with
respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereto hereby (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of the other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the
event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it has been induced to enter into this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Acquisition Agreements,
as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications
in this Section 10.08.   SECTION 10.09. Arbitration . All disputes arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Acquisition Documents, and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, which cannot be resolved
through the procedures described herein or therein shall be finally resolved
solely and exclusively by means of arbitration under the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") to be
conducted in English in the City of New York. The arbitration shall be
conducted by three (3) arbitrators appointed by agreement of the parties, or
failing such agreement, under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association. The arbitration will proceed in accordance
with the AAA\'s Commercial Arbitration Rules. The decision of the arbitrator
shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon the parties, and a judgment upon
the award may be obtained and entered in any federal or state court of
competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that any arbitration shall be kept
confidential and any element of such arbitration (including but not
limited to any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged,
any testimony or other oral submissions, and any awards) shall not be
disclosed beyond the arbitral tribunal, the parties, their counsel and any
person necessary to conduct the arbitration, except as may be required in
recognition and enforcement proceedings, if any, or in order to satisfy
disclosure obligations imposed by any applicable Law. The parties agree to
cooperate in providing each other with all discovery, including but not
limited to the exchange of documents and depositions of parties and non-
parties, reasonably related to the issues in the arbitration. If the parties
are unable to agree on any matter relating to such discovery, any such
difference shall be determined by the arbitrator. The award of the arbitrator
shall be final and binding upon the parties, and shall not be subject to any
appeal or review. The parties agree that such award may be recognized and
enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties also agree to
submit to the non-exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state
courts sitting in New York, New York, for the limited purpose of enforcing
this arbitration agreement (including, where   
76       appropriate, issuing injunctive relief) or any award resulting
from arbitration pursuant to this Section 10.09. The parties agree that the
arbitration proceeding described in this Section 10.09 is the sole and
exclusive manner in which the parties may resolve disputes arising out of or
in connection with this Agreement and the Acquisition Documents. The
arbitrator has the discretion to grant the prevailing party in any
arbitration attorneys\' fees and costs and make the non-prevailing party
responsible for all expenses of the arbitration.   SECTION 10.10. Currency .
Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all references to currency,
monetary values and dollars set forth herein shall mean United States (U.S.)
dollars and all payments hereunder shall be made in United States
dollars.   SECTION 10.11. Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts,
and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.    77
