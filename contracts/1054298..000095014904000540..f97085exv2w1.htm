<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Boards of Directors of Target, Acquiror and Merger Sub and the
manager of the LLC believe it is fair to and in the best interests of their
respective companies and the stockholders or sole member of their respective
companies that Target and the LLC combine into a single company through the
merger of Merger Sub with and into Target (the &#147;Step One Merger&#148;) and the
merger of Target, as surviving corporation of the Step One Merger, with and
into the LLC (the &#147;Step Two Merger,&#148; and together with the Step One Merger, the
&#147;Mergers&#148;), with the LLC being the ultimate surviving entity in the Mergers,
and, in furtherance thereof, have approved and declared the advisability of
this Agreement and the Mergers.

shares of Acquiror&#146;s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the &#147;Acquiror
Common Stock&#148;), and cash as set forth herein.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of
the Principal Stockholders is entering into a Stockholder Agreement in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;A (each a &#147;Stockholder Agreement&#148;), a Standstill
Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;B (each a &#147;Standstill
Agreement&#148;), and a Stock Resale Agreement in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit&nbsp;C (each, a &#147;Stock Resale Agreement&#148;).

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Target, Acquiror, Merger Sub and the LLC desire to make certain
representations and warranties, covenants and other agreements in connection
with the Mergers.

reorganization within the meaning of Section&nbsp;368 of the Internal Revenue Code

as a foreign corporation or limited liability company, as applicable, to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be
so qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not constitute,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Target or either
of Focus Interactive, Inc. or MaxOnline, LLC (collectively, the &#147;Material
Subsidiaries&#148;). Section&nbsp;2.1 of the Target Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true, correct and complete list of each subsidiary of Target (direct and

created pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii)&nbsp;for Target&#146;s right to repurchase
any unvested shares under the Target Stock Option Plan or any stock option or
restricted stock purchase agreement, there are no options, warrants, calls,

Target to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of, change the price of, or
otherwise amend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right, commitment
or agreement. Except as contemplated herein, Target has not taken any action
that would result in the accelerated vesting, exercisability or payment of

Options permit the assumption or substitution of options to purchase Acquiror
Common Stock as provided in this Agreement, without the consent or approval of

which do not qualify as Zero Priced Options), and all holders of Zero Priced
Options, have timely filed elections to be taxed at the time of grant or
issuance, as applicable, under Section&nbsp;83(b) of the Code (each, an &#147;83(b)
Election&#148;) with respect thereto, and each such 83(b) Election is valid,
effective and continues in full force and effect. The statement filed by or on
behalf of each such holder with the Internal Revenue Service (the &#147;IRS&#148;) to
make such 83(b) Election reflected the correct &#147;fair market value&#148; (within the
meaning of Section&nbsp;83 of the Code) of the subject Target equity securities as
of the time such securities were &#147;transferred&#148; (within the meaning of Section
83 of the Code) to the holder. Target correctly reported to the applicable
taxing authorities any taxable income required to be reported with respect to
the making of such 83(b) Elections and correctly withheld all taxes required to
be withheld with respect to the making of such 83(b) Elections. As to each
Target Option other than a Zero Priced Option: (i)&nbsp;no 83(b) Election was made
(or, to Target&#146;s knowledge, purported to be made) with respect to such option,
(ii)&nbsp;such option did not constitute taxable income to the recipient of such
option for federal, and applicable state, income and employment tax purposes
either at the time of grant or vesting of such option, (iii)&nbsp;the timing and
amount of any taxable income realized with respect to such option will be

determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1.83-7, and (iv)
neither the Target nor any agent of Target has made any representation or
warranty, or otherwise provided any advice to any recipient of such an option,
that is contrary to the foregoing provisions of this sentence. There are no
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character (contingent or
otherwise) pursuant to which any Person is or may be entitled to cause Target
or any of its subsidiaries to file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) a registration statement under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;), or which otherwise relate to the
registration of any securities of Target or any of its subsidiaries.

Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Code Section&nbsp;401(a) or
Code Section&nbsp;501(a), respectively, has received a favorable determination
letter from the IRS as to the qualified status of such plan and trust and, to
the knowledge of Target, no event has occurred which would reasonably give rise
to disqualification of the Employee Plan or related trust under Code Section
401(a) or Code Section&nbsp;501(a), respectively. Each such determination letter
covers, without limitation, the amendments to the Code effected by the Tax
Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation for which the Internal Revenue
Service will currently issue determination letters. No amendment to any such
Employee Plan has been adopted since the date of the latest such determination
letter (except for any amendment intended solely as good faith compliance with
the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001).

carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted
and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified and in good standing

Article&nbsp;Eight, from and after the Effective Time, the former stockholders of
Target shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Acquiror, the Interim
Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company and their respective
affiliates, officers, directors, managers, members, employees, representatives
and agents and each Person, if any, who controls Acquiror within the meaning of
the Securities Act (Acquiror, the Interim Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Company and each of the foregoing Persons is hereinafter referred to
individually as an &#147;Indemnified Person&#148; and collectively as &#147;Indemnified
Persons&#148;) from and against any and all actual losses, costs, damages,
liabilities, fees (including without limitation reasonable attorneys&#146; fees) and
expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation) (collectively, the
&#147;Damages&#148;), that any of the Indemnified Persons incurs by reason of or as a
result of (i)&nbsp;any misrepresentation, breach or default of, any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Target contained in
this Agreement, including any exhibits, schedules, closing certificates
furnished by Target or the Target Disclosure Schedule delivered pursuant
hereto, for which the Indemnified Person delivers a timely written notice
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, (ii)&nbsp;any Excess Merger Fees that are not
deducted from the Cash Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to Sections
1.6 and 7.4, (iii)&nbsp;Tax Claims or (iv)&nbsp;fraud or intentional misrepresentation by
Target or any of its subsidiaries. Damages in each case shall be net of the
amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnity and contribution actually recovered
by the Indemnified Person (reduced by any Tax cost to the Indemnified Person as
a result of the indemnity payments). In addition, Damages shall be reduced (at
the time and in the manner discussed in the following sentence) to take account
of the amount of any Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Person or any
Affiliate or group of Affiliates of such Indemnified Person arising from the
incurrence or payment of any such Damages. In computing the amount of any such
Tax benefit, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to realize a Tax benefit on
(i)&nbsp;the date on which the Tax benefit is received as a refund of Taxes, or (ii)
to the extent that the Tax benefit is not received as a refund of Taxes but
rather is claimed as an item that reduces liability for Taxes (determined on a
with and without basis), the due date (including extensions) of the Tax Return
that reflects such change in liability for Taxes, in each case, based on the
Indemnified Person&#146;s good faith determination.

Capital Stock for any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Target shall be limited to and paid solely from such

Damages for such fraud or intentional misrepresentation in excess of the

portion of the sum of the Merger Consideration, Additional Stock Consideration,
if applicable, Earn-out Consideration, if applicable, and Series&nbsp;A Dividend

receive any of the Escrow Shares or Escrow Cash from the Escrow Fund under
Section&nbsp;8.3(a)(i) unless and until a certificate signed by an officer of
Acquiror (an &#147;Officer&#146;s Certificate&#148;) identifying Damages in the aggregate

the Effective Time and terminate on the Escrow Termination Date. Upon the
expiration of the Claims Period, the Escrow Fund shall terminate with respect

have been resolved. As such claims are resolved, the Escrow Agent shall

property remaining in the Escrow Fund and not required to satisfy such resolved
claims or any remaining unresolved claims. Deliveries of Escrow Shares and
Escrow Cash to the stockholders of Target pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8.5 and the

other Governmental Entity or taxing authority with respect to the Tax Claims
and Acquiror&#146;s reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) actually incurred in connection with the Tax Claims. To the extent
Special Escrow Cash or Special Escrow Shares remain in the Special Escrow Fund
after all such payments to Acquiror, the Special Escrow Fund shall be promptly
distributed pro rata among the former Target stockholders based on the
proportionate interest of each such stockholder. Claims against the Special
Escrow Fund shall be made in accordance with Section&nbsp;8.8 and the Escrow

the IRS or any other Taxing authority or if Acquiror or the Surviving Company
have incurred expenses for which claims can be made against the Special Escrow
Fund, the Stockholders&#146; Representative shall not be entitled to contest the
existence of the Tax Claims. In addition, the Stockholders&#146; Representative
shall be entitled to control the process of resolving the Tax Claims provided
that the Stockholders&#146; Representative shall not voluntarily resolve any or all
Tax Claims in a manner that would result in aggregate payments therefor in
excess of the Special Escrow Fund without Acquiror&#146;s prior written consent.
The Special Escrow Cash in the Special Escrow Fund shall be invested in the
