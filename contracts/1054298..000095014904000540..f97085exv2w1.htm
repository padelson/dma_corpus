AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION   

 This Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of March 3, 2004, by and among Ask Jeeves, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Acquiror"), Interactive Search Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Target"), Aqua Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror ("Merger Sub"), and Aqua Acquisition Holdings LLC, a single member Delaware limited liability company wholly owned by Acquiror (the "LLC").  

RECITALS   

 A. The Boards of Directors of Target, Acquiror and Merger Sub and the manager of the LLC believe it is fair to and in the best interests of their respective companies and the stockholders or sole member of their respective companies that Target and the LLC combine into a single company through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Target (the "Step One Merger") and the merger of Target, as surviving corporation of the Step One Merger, with and into the LLC (the "Step Two Merger," and together with the Step One Merger, the "Mergers"), with the LLC being the ultimate surviving entity in the Mergers, and, in furtherance thereof, have approved and declared the advisability of this Agreement and the Mergers.  

 B. Pursuant to the Mergers, subject to the terms hereof, the outstanding shares of capital stock of Target shall be converted into the right to receive shares of Acquirors common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Acquiror Common Stock"), and cash as set forth herein.  

 C. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the Principal Stockholders is entering into a Stockholder Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (each a "Stockholder Agreement"), a Standstill Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (each a "Standstill Agreement"), and a Stock Resale Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (each, a "Stock Resale Agreement").  

 D. Target, Acquiror, Merger Sub and the LLC desire to make certain representations and warranties, covenants and other agreements in connection with the Mergers.  

 E. The parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and to cause the Mergers together to qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368 of the Code.  

AGREEMENT   

 For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:   ##### 

 

ARTICLE ONE   

The Mergers   

 1.1 The Step One Merger. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger in connection with the Step One Merger attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Certificate of Merger") and the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Target, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Target shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Step One Merger. Target as the interim surviving corporation following the Step One Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Interim Surviving Corporation."   

 1.2 Closing; Effective Time. The closing of the Step One Merger (the "Closing") shall take place as soon as practicable, and in no event later than two (2) business days after the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in Article Six below or at such other time as the parties agree (the "Closing Date"). In connection with the Closing, the parties shall cause the Step One Merger to be consummated by filing the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the time of such filing being the "Effective Time"). The Closing shall take place at the offices of OMelveny and Myers LLP, 2765 Sand Hill Road, Menlo Park, California, or at such other location as the parties agree.   

 1.3 Effect of the Step One Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Step One Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Target and Merger Sub shall vest in the Interim Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Target and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Interim Surviving Corporation.   

 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.   

 (a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Target shall be amended to read in its entirety as set forth as Exhibit E hereto until thereafter amended as provided by Delaware Law and such Certificate of Incorporation.   

 (b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Target shall be amended to read in their entirety as set forth as Exhibit F hereto until thereafter amended as provided by Delaware Law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Interim Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.   

 1.5 Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Interim Surviving Corporation, and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the officers of the Interim Surviving Corporation, in each case, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.     ##### 

    

 1.6 Effect on Capital Stock. By virtue of the Step One Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, Target or any of its stockholders, the following shall occur at the Effective Time:   

 (a) Treatment of Vested Target Capital Stock.   

 (i) Each share of Targets Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Class A Common Stock"), and Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Class B Common Stock", and together with the Class A Common Stock, "Target Common Stock", and, collectively with the Series A Preferred Stock, the "Target Capital Stock") issued and outstanding and fully-vested immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive, subject to the terms of Section 8.2 and Section 8.7, (A) the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock that is equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) 9,300,000 less the number of Target Option Additional Shares by (2) the sum of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Target Common Stock (whether vested or unvested), the total number of shares of Target Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the total number of shares of Target Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Target Options assumed by Acquiror at the Effective Time (the "Stock Ratio"), (B) cash equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) $150,000,000 less any Excess Merger Fees and less the Series A Dividend (the "Maximum Cash Amount") by (2) the sum of (x) the total number of issued, outstanding and fully-vested shares of Target Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, plus (y) the total number of shares of Target Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, plus (z) if (and only if) an Unvested Share Waiver is not obtained with respect to any Unvested Target Shares, the total number of Unvested Target Shares not subject to an Unvested Share Waiver immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Cash Per Share"), and (C) if applicable, a portion of the Earn-out Consideration equal to the Earn-out Consideration divided by the sum of the total number of issued and outstanding and fully-vested shares of Target Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, plus the total number of shares of Target Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, plus, if (and only if) an Unvested Share Waiver is not obtained with respect to any Unvested Target Shares, the total number of Unvested Target Shares not subject to an Unvested Share Waiver immediately prior to the Effective Time.   

 (ii) Each share of Targets Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Series A Preferred Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive, subject to the terms of Section 8.2 and Section 8.7, (A) a number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the Stock Ratio multiplied by the number of shares of Target Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series A Preferred Stock, (B) cash equal to the Cash Per Share multiplied by the number of shares of Target Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series A Preferred Stock, and (C) if applicable, a portion of the Earn-out Consideration equal to (1) the Earn-out Consideration divided by (2) the sum of the total number of issued and outstanding and fully-vested shares of Target Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, plus the total number of shares of Target Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, plus, if     ##### 

    

(and only if) an Unvested Share Waiver is not obtained with respect to
any Unvested Target Shares, the total number of Unvested Target Shares not
subject to an Unvested Share Waiver immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by the number of shares of Target Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of such share of Series A Preferred Stock. Prior to the Closing,
Target shall have declared and paid to the holder of each share of Series A
Preferred Stock the accrued and unpaid dividend on each share of Series A
Preferred Stock (the aggregate of all such amounts paid on the Series A
Preferred Stock is referred to as the "Series A Dividend").  

 (iii) Earn-out Consideration.   

 (A) In the event that (1) the value of the sum of the Merger Consideration, the Series A Dividend and the Excess Merger Fees (where each share of Acquiror Common Stock issued or issuable as part of the Merger Consideration is valued at the Closing Price) is less than $375,000,000, and (2) the Surviving Company shall have Net Revenues for the twelve-month period following the Closing Date (the "Measurement Period") of at least $121,580,000 (the "Target Amount"), Acquiror shall pay the Earn-out Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a)(i) and Section 1.6(a)(ii). The "Earn-out Consideration" shall consist of cash in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the difference between ( _a_ ) $375,000,000 and _(b)_ the value of the sum of the Merger Consideration, the Series A Dividend and the Excess Merger Fees (where each share of Acquiror Common Stock issued or issuable as part of the Merger Consideration is valued at the Closing Price), and (2) $17,500,000. "Net Revenues" means gross revenues of the Surviving Company (on a consolidated basis with its subsidiaries) determined in accordance with GAAP consistently applied less Traffic Acquisition Costs; provided that Net Revenues shall not include gross revenues directly attributable to new Fun Web Products of the Surviving Company introduced after the seven-month anniversary of the Closing Date. "Traffic Acquisition Costs" means (1) the amount of revenue share payments made by the Surviving Company to third party distributors of the Surviving Companys My Search browser plug-in plus (2) the amount paid by the Surviving Company to third party media providers to display advertising for the Surviving Companys line of Fun Web Products (for example, among others, Smiley Central and CursorMania), in each case for the applicable period; provided that Traffic Acquisition Costs shall not include any of the costs described in (1) or (2) directly attributable to new Fun Web Products of the Surviving Company introduced after the seven-month anniversary of the Closing Date.   

 (B) Surviving Company agrees that during the Measurement Period it shall (1) use commercially reasonable efforts to operate its business in a manner consistent in all material respects with Targets conduct of the business at the Effective Time, (2) not take or omit to take any action (including, without limitation, reducing or deferring sales, marketing, new product or new business development efforts or deferring the execution of agreements) that is intended to reduce or limit the Net Revenues unless otherwise approved by an executive officer of the Surviving Company who was one of the co-chief executive officers of Target at the Effective Time, and (3) cause all company opportunities arising through or as a direct result of the business activities of the Surviving Company to obtain, retain, renew or otherwise profit from the business or activities of the Surviving Company to be offered first to the Surviving Company and not made available to Acquiror or other subsidiaries or divisions of Acquiror unless declined by an executive officer of the Surviving Company who was one of the co-chief executive officers of Target at the Effective Time. In the event that the manager of the     ##### 

    

Surviving Company (the "Manager") believes in good faith that a reduction in
traffic acquisition investments or the reduction or deferring of
sales, marketing, new product or new business development efforts or
deferring the execution of agreements is necessary or advisable to further
the long-term success of the Surviving Companys business, a representative
of the Manager and one of the co-chief executive officers of Target
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall negotiate in good faith to
adjust, through the application of historical data, the Target Amount
downward. If the Manager and such former co-chief executive officer of Target
cannot reach agreement on such adjustment within thirty (30) days from the
date such parties initiated negotiations regarding the adjustment, the
parties shall submit the matter to the Independent Accounting Firm and the
adjustment shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.6(a)(iii)(E)
below.  

 (C) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time Acquiror shall agree in writing for the benefit of the stockholders of Target as of the Effective Time that the Earn-out Consideration shall be unconditionally payable at the end of the Measurement Period without regard to the other provisions of this Section 1.6(a)(iii), then the other provisions of Section 1.6(a)(iii) shall be of no further force or effect from and after the date of such agreement.   

 (D) Acquiror shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholders Representative, within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the Measurement Period, a statement setting forth its good faith calculations of the Net Revenues and Traffic Acquisition Costs of the Surviving Company for the Measurement Period (the "Earn-out Statement"). Acquiror shall give the Stockholders Representative and its accountants and other appropriate personnel such assistance and access to the books and records and relevant personnel of the Surviving Company as such accountants or other personnel may reasonably request during normal business hours in order to enable the Stockholders Representative to review the Earn-out Statement and analyze the underlying information. Prior to gaining access to such books, records and personnel, the Stockholders Representative shall enter into a mutually acceptable non-disclosure agreement with Acquiror and/or the Surviving Company with respect to the confidential information of Acquiror and/or the Surviving Company obtained as a part of such review.   

 (E) The Earn-out Statement shall be final and binding unless the Stockholders Representative shall, within fifteen (15) Business Days following the delivery of the Earn-out Statement, deliver to Acquiror written notice of objection (the "Objection Notice") with respect to the Earn-out Statement. The Objection Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for the dispute, including the data that forms the basis thereof, as well as the amount in dispute.   

 (F) If the Objection Notice is delivered, the parties shall consult with each other with respect to the dispute and attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute. If the parties are unable to reach agreement within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Objection Notice, either Acquiror or the Stockholders Representative may refer any unresolved disputes to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC (the "Independent Accounting Firm"). The Independent Accounting Firm shall be directed to render a written report as promptly as practicable and, in any event, within thirty (30) days of the Independent Accounting Firms    ##### 

 

engagement regarding the dispute. The resolution of the dispute by
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties.
The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne
equally by Acquiror and the Stockholders Representative.  

 (b) Treatment of Unvested Target Common Stock. If prior to the Effective Time, Target shall have received a waiver of the right to share in the Cash Consideration, the Earn-out Consideration and the Additional Stock Consideration described in Section 1.6(g) (the "Unvested Share Waiver") executed by the applicable holder of unvested shares of Target Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time as set forth on Schedule 1.6(b) ("Unvested Target Shares"), then each of such holders Unvested Target Shares shall be converted into the right to receive only the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock that is equal to the Stock Ratio, and no portion of the Cash Consideration, the Earn-out Consideration or the Additional Stock Consideration. If the Unvested Share Waiver is not executed then each of such holders Unvested Target Shares shall be converted into the right to receive (A) the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock that is equal to the Stock Ratio, plus (B) a portion of the Maximum Cash Amount equal to the Maximum Cash Amount divided by the sum of (i) the total number of issued, outstanding and fully-vested shares of Target Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, plus (ii) the total number of shares of Target Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, plus (iii) the total number of Unvested Target Shares not subject to an Unvested Share Wavier immediately prior to the Effective Time, plus (C) if applicable, a portion of the Earn-out Consideration equal to the Earn-out Consideration divided by the sum of the total number of issued and outstanding and fully-vested shares of Target Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, plus the total number of shares of Target Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, plus, the total number of Unvested Target Shares not subject to an Unvested Share Waiver immediately prior to the Effective Time.   

 (c) Certain Definitions.   

 (i) For purposes of this Agreement, "Person" shall mean any natural person, company, corporation, limited liability company, general partnership, limited partnership, trust, proprietorship, joint venture, business organization or Governmental Entity.   

 (ii) For purposes of this Agreement, the shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.6(a) and Section 1.6(b) are referred to as the "Stock Consideration" and the aggregate amount of cash to be paid pursuant to Section 1.6(a) is referred to as the "Cash Consideration". The Stock Consideration plus the Cash Consideration plus the Target Option Consideration is referred to as the "Merger Consideration."   

 (iii) "Excess Merger Fees" are any fees in excess of $5,000,000 attributable to legal, accounting, investment banking, brokers and finders fees either paid or payable by Target, or Acquiror or the Surviving Company on behalf of Target, in connection with the Mergers, excluding the value of any such fees paid in shares of Target Capital Stock or Acquiror Common Stock in exchange for converted shares of Target Capital Stock.     ##### 

    

 (d) All shares of Target Capital Stock, when so converted at the Effective Time, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Target Capital Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive its respective portion of the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 1.7, without interest, unless required by law, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Interim Surviving Corporation of certificates formerly representing shares of Target Capital Stock. If, after the Effective Time, certificates formerly representing shares of Target Capital Stock are presented to the Interim Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or Acquiror for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article One.   

 (e) Cancellation of Target Capital Stock Owned by Target. At the Effective Time, all shares of Target Capital Stock that are owned by Target as treasury stock or by any direct or indirect subsidiary of Target immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.   

 (f) Treatment of Target Options; Unvested Target Shares.   

 (i) Assumption of Outstanding Target Options.   

 (A) All unvested options to purchase Target Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Target Options") under Targets 2001 Equity Incentive Plan and 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (together, the "Target Stock Option Plan"), shall, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Step One Merger and without any further action on the part of Target or the holder thereof, be assumed by Acquiror in accordance with this Section 1.6(f). Target shall take such action as may be required in order to ensure that all vested options under the Target Stock Plan, to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, shall terminate at the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquiror shall not assume any Target Options having no exercise price or an exercise price per share less than the par value per share of the shares of Target Capital Stock subject to such Target Options (the "Zero Priced Options"), and Target shall take such action as may be required in order to ensure that such Zero Priced Options, to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, shall terminate at the Effective Time. At such times prior to the Closing as Acquiror shall request and on the Closing Date, Target shall deliver to Acquiror an updated list of all holders of outstanding Target Options as of such date, including the number of shares of Target Capital Stock subject to each such option, the exercise or vesting schedule, the exercise price per share and the term of each such option. Each Target Option assumed by Acquiror under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the Target Stock Option Plan and the applicable stock option agreement as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any accelerated vesting as a result of the Mergers), except that (i) each Target Option will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to (1) the Stock Ratio plus (2) the quotient obtained by dividing the Target Option Additional Shares divided by the total number of shares of Target Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Target Options assumed by Acquiror at the Effective Time (rounded down to the nearest whole number of share subject to such Target Option) (the "Option Exchange Ratio"),     ##### 

    

and (ii) the exercise price per share shall be equal to (1) the
exercise price per share of Target Common Stock of such Target Option divided
by (2) the Option Exchange Ratio.  

 (B) The number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock subject to assumed Target Options is referred to as the "Target Option Consideration." The weighted average closing price of a share of Acquiror Common Stock for the thirty (30) most recent days that Acquiror Common Stock has traded, ending on the trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market is referred to as the "Closing Price". The number of "Target Option Additional Shares" shall be calculated by multiplying the number of shares of Target Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Target Options assumed by Acquiror at the Effective Time by the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the Cash Per Share by (2) the Closing Price.    

 (C) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Acquiror will issue to each Person who, immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of a Target Option under the Target Stock Option Plan, a written document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such option by Acquiror.   

 (ii) Unvested Target Shares. Except as set forth in Section 1.6 of the Target Disclosure Schedule, the repurchase option, vesting schedule or other condition applicable to each Unvested Target Share shall be assigned to Acquiror and the shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued upon the conversion of the Unvested Target Shares in the Step One Merger shall continue to be unvested and subject to the same repurchase options, vesting schedules or other conditions, as applicable, immediately following the Effective Time as they were subject to immediately prior to the Effective Time, after giving effect to any acceleration, lapse or other vesting occurring by operation of the Mergers. The certificates representing such shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall accordingly be marked with appropriate legends noting such repurchase options, vesting schedules or other conditions. Target shall take all actions that are reasonably necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Acquiror (or its assignee) shall be entitled to exercise any such repurchase option, vesting schedule or other right applicable to each Unvested Target Share.   

 (g) Additional Stock Consideration. In the event that during the twelve-month period after the Effective Time, either (1) Acquiror or the Surviving Company exercises a repurchase right with respect to shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued in exchange for Unvested Target Shares or (2) Acquiror or the Surviving Company exercises a repurchase right with respect to shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued upon exercise of assumed Target Options or any Target Options are cancelled, in each case as a result of the termination of employment by the Surviving Company without cause (as such term is defined in the applicable plan, document or agreement governing such Unvested Target Shares or Target Options, if defined therein) of any of the Persons listed on Schedule 1.6(g), then:   

  (i) in the case of (1) above, within thirty (30) days
following the end of such twelve-month period, Acquiror shall issue and
deliver to the former Target stockholders whose shares were converted pursuant
to Section 1.6(a) and (if, but only if, an Unvested Share Waiver has not been
delivered by a holder with respect to such holders   ##### 

  

Unvested Target Shares) 1.6(b) certificates representing in the
aggregate that number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock that were so
repurchased; and  

 (ii) in the case of (2) above, within thirty (30) days following the end of such twelve-month period, Acquiror shall issue and deliver to the former Target stockholders whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 1.6(a) and (if, but only if, an Unvested Share Waiver has not been delivered by a holder with respect to such holders Unvested Target Shares) 1.6(b) certificates representing in the aggregate a number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to (x) the difference between the Closing Price and the exercise price per share of the applicable assumed Target Option multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock subject to such Target Option divided by (z) the Closing Price.   

Within fifteen (15) days following the end of such twelve-month
period, Acquiror shall deliver to the Stockholders Representative a
schedule, certified by its Chief Financial Officer, showing the aggregate
number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued pursuant to (i) and
(ii) above. Any shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued under this Section
1.6(g) shall be issued to the former Target stockholders in proportion to
each such stockholders interest in the Stock Consideration (provided that no
Additional Stock Consideration shall be issued with respect to any Unvested
Target Share that is repurchased by Acquiror or the Surviving Company as
described in (1) above, and the Additional Stock Consideration otherwise
allocable to such Unvested Target Shares shall be re-allocated
proportionately). "Additional Stock Consideration" means the aggregate of the
number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock delivered pursuant to this Section
1.6(g).  

 (h) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Interim Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of common stock of the Interim Surviving Corporation.   

 (i) Adjustments. All share numbers herein, including, but not limited to, the Stock Consideration, shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Acquiror Common Stock or Target Capital Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to Acquiror Common Stock or Target Capital Stock, as appropriate, occurring after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.   

 (j) Dissenters Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.6 to the contrary, any shares of Target Capital Stock held by Persons that properly exercise appraisal rights in accordance with Delaware Law ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration and, as applicable, the Earn-out Consideration and the Additional Stock Consideration, but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Delaware Law. Target agrees that prior to the Effective Time, except with the prior written consent of Acquiror, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, or as required under Delaware Law, it will not     ##### 

    

voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such purchase demand. If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares
shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares, Acquiror shall issue
and deliver, upon surrender by such holder of a certificate or
certificates representing shares of Target Capital Stock, the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration and, as applicable, the Earn-out
Consideration and Additional Stock Consideration, to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled under this Section 1.6 and the Certificate of Merger
less the number of shares and cash allocable to such holder that are
deposited in the Escrow Fund and the Special Escrow Fund in respect of such
Merger Consideration pursuant to Article Eight below.  

 (k) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Acquiror Common Stock will be issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Target Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Acquiror Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from Acquiror an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Closing Price.   

 1.7 Surrender of Certificates.   

 (a) Exchange Agent. Equiserve Trust Company, N.A. shall act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Step One Merger.   

 (b) Acquiror to Provide Common Stock and Cash. Immediately after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article One: (i) the shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.6(a) and Section 1.6(b) less the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be deposited into the Escrow Fund and the Special Escrow Fund pursuant to Article Eight; (ii) sufficient funds in amounts and at times necessary for the payment of the Cash Consideration in the amounts and at the times provided herein less the amount of the Cash Consideration to be deposited into the Escrow Fund and the Special Escrow Fund pursuant to Article Eight; and (iii) cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(k). Exchange Agent shall distribute the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration, less amounts deposited in the Escrow Fund and the Special Escrow Fund pursuant to Article Eight, to each former Target stockholder as soon as reasonably practicable in accordance with Exchange Agents normal practices after such former Target stockholder tenders his/her/its Target stock certificates for exchange.   

 (c) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than ten (10) days thereafter, Acquiror will instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of a certificate which immediately before the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Target Capital Stock (such certificates are collectively referred to as the "Certificates"), other than Dissenting Shares, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall (x) specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, (y) expressly appoint the Stockholders Representative as attorney-in-fact and agent for and on behalf of the applicable former Target Stockholder and approve the authority and contribution provisions contained in Sections 2 and 8 of the Escrow Agreement, and (z) be in a customary form), and (ii) instructions     ##### 

    

for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for certificates representing shares of Acquiror Common Stock (and cash in
lieu of fractional shares) and cash. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of the Certificate will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (i) a certificate evidencing that number of whole shares of
Acquiror Common Stock and that amount of cash which such holder has the right
to receive hereunder in respect of the shares formerly evidenced by such
Certificate, and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in
Section 1.6(k). In the event of a transfer of ownership of Target Capital
Stock which is not registered in the transfer books of Target, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock may be
issued and cash may be delivered to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer,
is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment pays any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of the issuance of shares of Acquiror Common Stock or the payment of cash to
a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establishes
to the satisfaction of Acquiror that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable, and has provided to Acquiror any reasonably requested bond with
respect to such Certificate.  

 (d) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.7, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company or any party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   

 (e) Dissenting Shares. The provisions of this Section 1.7 shall also apply to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except that the obligations of Acquiror under this Section 1.7 shall commence on the date of loss of such status and the holder of such shares shall, subject to Section 1.7(b) and Article Eight, be entitled to receive in exchange for each such share its proportionate amount of the Merger Consideration and, as applicable, the Earn-out Consideration and the Additional Stock Consideration.   

 (f) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Acquiror Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time payable (but for the provisions of this Section 1.7(f)) with respect to such shares of Acquiror Common Stock.   

 (g) Transfers of Ownership. If, at the request of the registered holder thereof, any certificate for shares of Acquiror Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of such issuance that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange will have     ##### 

    

paid to Acquiror or any agent designated by it any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of
Acquiror Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of
the Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Acquiror
or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.  

 1.8 Tax Consequences. The Mergers, together, are intended to qualify as a "reorganization" as described in Section 368 of the Code, and this Agreement is  intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of the regulations promulgated under Section 368 of the Code and neither the Acquiror, the Surviving Company, nor any other party to this Agreement shall take a position on any Returns or other statement or report to any government or taxing authority inconsistent with such intention unless required to do so by applicable Tax law.   

 1.9 Taking of Necessary Action. If at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Company with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Target and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the Surviving Company, are fully authorized in the name of their respective entities or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action to accomplish the same, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.   

 1.10 Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent, Acquiror, and the Interim Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Target Capital Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable legal requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.   

 1.11 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the portion of the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.6 with respect to each share of Target Capital Stock represented by such Certificate; provided, however, that Acquiror may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to such issuance and payment, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a lost securities bond in such sum as Acquiror may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Acquiror, the Interim Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   

 1.12 Step Two Merger.   

 (a) Timing. Immediately following the Effective Time on the Closing Date, the Interim Surviving Corporation shall be merged directly with and into the LLC in accordance with Delaware Law. Following the Step Two Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Interim Surviving Corporation shall cease and the LLC shall continue as the     ##### 

    

Surviving Company of the Step Two Merger. The LLC, as the surviving company
following the Step Two Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the
"Surviving Company."  

 (b) Step Two Merger Effective Time. Immediately following the Effective  Time on the Closing Date, the Step Two Merger shall be consummated by the LLC filing a Certificate of Merger in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G (the "Step Two Certificate of Merger") as required by applicable law with respect to the Step Two Merger. The Step Two Merger shall become effective at such time as the Step Two Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (the "Step Two Merger Effective Time").   

 (c) Effect of the Step Two Merger. At the Step Two Merger Effective Time, the effect of the Step Two Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Step Two Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, at the Step Two Merger Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Interim Surviving Corporation shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Interim Surviving Corporation shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.   

 (d) Certificate of Formation; Operating Agreement.   

 (i) At the Step Two Merger Effective Time, the Certificate of Formation of the LLC, as in effect immediately prior to the Step Two Merger Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Formation of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended as provided by Delaware Law and such Certificate of Formation.   

 (ii) At the Step Two Merger Effective Time, the Operating Agreement of the LLC, as in effect immediately prior to the Step Two Merger Effective Time, shall constitute the Operating Agreement of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended as provided by law, the Certificate of Formation of the Surviving Company and such Operating Agreement.   

 (e) Manager and Officers. At the Step Two Effective Time, the manager of the LLC immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the manager of the Surviving Company, and the officers of the LLC immediately prior to the Step Two Merger Effective Time, shall be the officers of the Surviving Company, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.   

 (f) Treatment of Capital Stock In Step Two Merger. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Step Two Merger Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Step Two Merger and without any action on the part of any stockholder:   

 (i) each membership interest of the LLC outstanding immediately prior to the Step Two Merger shall be unchanged and shall remain issued and outstanding; and   

 (ii) each share of Interim Surviving Corporation common stock issued and outstanding prior to the Step Two Merger Effective Time shall be cancelled without    ##### 

 

consideration and shall cease to be an issued and outstanding share
of Interim Surviving Corporation common stock.  

ARTICLE TWO   

Representations and Warranties of Target   

 Except as disclosed in a document dated as of the date of this Agreement and delivered by Target to Acquiror concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and referring to the representations and warranties of this Agreement (the "Target Disclosure Schedule"), Target hereby represents and warrants to Acquiror, Merger Sub and LLC as follows:   

 2.1 Organization. Target and each of its subsidiaries is a corporation or limited liability company, as applicable, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Target and each of its subsidiaries has the requisite corporate or limited liability company power and authority, as applicable, to own, lease and operate its respective properties and to carry on its respective business as now being conducted. Target and each of its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation or limited liability company, as applicable, to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Target or either of Focus Interactive, Inc. or MaxOnline, LLC (collectively, the "Material Subsidiaries"). Section 2.1 of the Target Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, correct and complete list of each subsidiary of Target (direct and indirect). All of the issued and outstanding equity securities of each of Targets subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. All of the issued and outstanding equity securities of each of Targets subsidiaries are owned, directly or indirectly, by Target free and clear of all liens, charges, claims or encumbrances or rights of others, and are not subject to any preemptive right or right of first refusal created by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws or other organizational documents, as applicable, of such subsidiary or any agreement to which such subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound.

All outstanding shares of Target Capital Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and are free of any liens or encumbrances created by Target, and are not subject to preemptive rights or rights of first refusal created by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Target or any agreement to which Target is a party or by which it is bound. All outstanding shares of Target Capital Stock were issued in compliance with all applicable federal and state securities laws. Each share of Target Preferred Stock is convertible into .65236303 shares of Target Common Stock. Holders of shares of Target Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, pursuant to Targets Certificate of Incorporation, the amount per share of the Merger Consideration as set forth in Section 1.6(a)(ii).

Section 2.3 of the Target Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, correct and complete list of all of Targets stockholders. Target has made available to Acquiror a true and complete list of all holders of outstanding Target Options, including the number of shares of Target Capital Stock subject to each such option, the exercise or vesting schedule, the exercise price per share and the term of each such option. Section 2.3 of the Target Disclosure Schedule sets forth the number of outstanding Target Options and all other rights to acquire shares of Target Capital Stock from the Target and the applicable exercise prices. None of the Target Options are incentive stock options. Except (i) for the rights created pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) for Targets right to repurchase any unvested shares under the Target Stock Option Plan or any stock option or restricted stock purchase agreement, there are no options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments, agreements or arrangements of any character to which Target is a party or by which Target is bound obligating Target to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase or redeem, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, any shares of capital stock of Target or obligating Target to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of, change the price of, or otherwise amend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right, commitment or agreement. Except as contemplated herein, Target has not taken any action that would result in the accelerated vesting, exercisability or payment of Target Options as a consequence of the execution of, or consummation of the transactions contemplated by, this    ##### 

 

Agreement. Consistent with the terms of the Target Stock Option Plan,
the documents governing the outstanding options under such plan and any other
stock option or restricted stock purchase agreement, the Step One Merger will
not accelerate the vesting, exercisability or payment of the Target Options
or the shares of Acquiror Common Stock which will be subject to those options
upon the Acquirors assumption of the Target Options in the Step One Merger.
To Targets knowledge, there are no contracts, commitments or agreements
relating to voting, purchase or sale of Targets capital stock between or
among, any of Targets stockholders, except for the Stockholder Agreements
and the irrevocable proxies delivered pursuant thereto. The terms of the
Target Options permit the assumption or substitution of options to purchase
Acquiror Common Stock as provided in this Agreement, without the consent or
approval of the holders of such securities, the Target stockholders, or
otherwise and without any acceleration of the exercise schedule or vesting
provisions in effect for those options. True and complete copies of all
agreements and instruments, and amendments, modifications and supplements
thereto, relating to Target Options have been made available to Acquiror or
its counsel and such agreements and instruments as so made available have not
been further amended, modified or supplemented, and there are no agreements
to amend, modify or supplement such agreements or instruments in any case
from the form made available to Acquiror or its counsel. All holders of
unvested Target equity securities, other than Target Options granted at fair
market value, are listed (along with such securities) in Section 2.3 of the
Target Disclosure Schedule. All holders of unvested Target equity securities
(other than Target Options which do not qualify as Zero Priced Options), and
all holders of Zero Priced Options, have timely filed elections to be taxed
at the time of grant or issuance, as applicable, under Section 83(b) of the
Code (each, an "83(b) Election") with respect thereto, and each such 83(b)
Election is valid, effective and continues in full force and effect. The
statement filed by or on behalf of each such holder with the Internal Revenue
Service (the "IRS") to make such 83(b) Election reflected the correct "fair
market value" (within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code) of the subject
Target equity securities as of the time such securities were "transferred"
(within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code) to the holder. Target
correctly reported to the applicable taxing authorities any taxable income
required to be reported with respect to the making of such 83(b) Elections
and correctly withheld all taxes required to be withheld with respect to the
making of such 83(b) Elections. As to each Target Option other than a Zero
Priced Option: (i) no 83(b) Election was made (or, to Targets knowledge,
purported to be made) with respect to such option, (ii) such option did not
constitute taxable income to the recipient of such option for federal, and
applicable state, income and employment tax purposes either at the time of
grant or vesting of such option, (iii) the timing and amount of any taxable
income realized with respect to such option will be  determined in
accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.83-7, and (iv) neither the
Target nor any agent of Target has made any representation or warranty, or
otherwise provided any advice to any recipient of such an option, that is
contrary to the foregoing provisions of this sentence. There are
no agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character (contingent
or otherwise) pursuant to which any Person is or may be entitled to cause
Target or any of its subsidiaries to file with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a registration statement under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or which otherwise relate to
the registration of any securities of Target or any of its subsidiaries.

Target and each of its subsidiaries has fulfilled all of its obligations under each Employee Plan and there is no existing default or event of default or any event which, with or without the giving of notice or the passage of time, would constitute a default by it under any Employee Plan which could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability. All material payments due from Target or any of its subsidiaries to date with respect to each of the Employee Plans have been timely made and all    ##### 

    

amounts properly accrued to the Closing as liabilities of Target (directly or
indirectly) with respect to each Employee Plan which have not been paid
have been properly recorded on the books of Target. There are no
negotiations, demands or proposals which are pending or which have been made
to Target or any of its subsidiaries which concern matters now covered, or
that would be covered, by any of the Employee Plans. Neither Target nor any
of its subsidiaries has announced a plan or made any legally binding
commitment to create any additional Employee Plan or to amend or modify any
existing Employee Plan, other than amendments required by Regulation.  

 (b) Target and each of its subsidiaries comply and have complied in all material respects with all applicable provisions of ERISA and all other Regulations applicable with respect to each Employee Plan. Neither Target nor any other member of Targets Controlled Group maintains or contributes to, nor has it ever maintained or contributed to, or been required to contribute to, any "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(34) of ERISA) which is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Neither Target nor any member of Targets Controlled Group maintains or contributes to, nor has it ever maintained or contributed to, or been required to contribute to, any "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. No Employee Plan covers any persons employed or providing services outside of the United States.    

 (c) With respect to each Employee Plan that is funded wholly or partially through an insurance policy, all amounts of the premiums required to have been paid to date under the insurance policy have been paid and, to Targets knowledge, there is no liability of Target or any of its subsidiaries under any such insurance policy or ancillary agreement with respect to such insurance policy in the nature of a retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other actual or contingent liability arising wholly or partially out of events occurring prior to the Closing.

The term "action" includes, without limitation, an action, suit, investigation, complaint or other proceeding threatened or pending against or affecting the person or its property, whether civil or criminal, in law or equity or before any arbitrator or Governmental Entity. By its terms, each Employee Plan, which is an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued by Target within 60 days without any liability (except for administrative expenses relating to such plans, benefits accrued or routine claims for benefits outstanding under such plans as of the date of such amendment, termination or discontinuance) to Target or any member of Targets Controlled Group and, to Targets knowledge, neither Target nor any member of Targets Controlled Group has made any commitment that would limit such amendment and termination authority. No Employee Plan is under audit or is the subject of any inquiry, investigation or other proceeding by the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other Governmental Entity, nor, to the knowledge of Target, is any such audit, inquiry, investigation or other proceeding threatened.    #####

Each such determination letter covers, without limitation, the amendments to the Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation for which the Internal Revenue Service will currently issue determination letters. No amendment to any such Employee Plan has been adopted since the date of the latest such determination letter (except for any amendment intended solely as good faith compliance with the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001).   

 (f) No event has occurred, and, to the knowledge of Target, no circumstances exist, which would reasonably be expected to subject Target, any member of Targets Controlled Group, or any Employee Plan, in each case directly or indirectly, to any material liability under ERISA, the Code or any other Regulation applicable to any Employee Plan or under any agreement, instrument or Regulation pursuant to or under which any such person or any Employee Plan has agreed to indemnify or is required to indemnify any person against liability, loss, or costs incurred under, or for a violation or failure to satisfy the requirements of, any such Regulation.

LLC is a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each of Acquiror and Merger Sub has the corporate power, and LLC has the requisite power, to own its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror. Acquiror is not in violation of any provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or equivalent organizational documents.   

 3.2 No Prior Activities. Except for the obligations incurred in connection with its organization or the negotiation or consummation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, neither Merger Sub nor LLC has incurred any obligation or liability or engaged in any business or activity of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreement or arrangement with any Person.

 3.5 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.   

 (a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of a benefit under (i) any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or other organizational documents of Acquiror, Merger Sub or LLC, as amended, or (ii) any material mortgage, indenture, lease, contract or other agreement or instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Acquiror, Merger Sub or LLC or their properties or assets, except where such conflicts, violations and defaults do not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror, Merger Sub or LLC.

 (b) The consolidated financial statements of Acquiror, including the notes thereto, included in the Acquiror SEC Documents (the "Acquiror Financial Statements") complied as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as of their respective dates, and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent throughout the periods indicated and consistent with each other (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, included in Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q).

There are no liens on any assets of Acquiror with respect to material amounts of Taxes, other than liens for Taxes not yet due and payable. No audit of the Returns of or including Acquiror, and no action or proceeding for assessment or collection of Taxes, by any government or taxing authority, is in process or pending or threatened in writing, and no material deficiencies exist or have been asserted with respect to Taxes of Acquiror, or any of its subsidiaries. Neither Acquiror nor any of its subsidiaries has been a distributing corporation or a controlled corporation in a transaction described in Section 355(a) of the Code.   

 3.8 Sufficiency of Funds.

prohibited by the listing standards of the NASD if Target or such subsidiary
were listed on the Nasdaq National Market; or  

 (z) Other. Take or agree to take any of the actions described in Sections 4.2(a) through (y) above, or any action that would (i) result in a breach of any of Targets representations or warranties contained in this Agreement that would, individually or together with any other breaches, constitute a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) prevent Target from performing or, except pursuant to Section 4.3, cause Target not to perform any of its covenants hereunder.   

 4.3 No Solicitation.   

 (a) No Solicitation or Negotiation. Except as set forth in this Section 4.3, Target shall not, nor shall Target authorize or permit any of its subsidiaries or any of its or its subsidiaries respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives (collectively, "Target Representatives") to, directly or indirectly:    

 (i) solicit, initiate, induce, encourage or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, including amending or granting any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any Target Capital Stock;   

 (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish to any person any information with respect to, assist or participate in any effort or attempt by any person with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Acquisition Proposal; or   

 (iii) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or enter into any letter of intent or agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal.   

Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as there has been no breach of
this Section 4.3(a), during the Specified Time, in response to an
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal received by it and otherwise in compliance
with its obligations under Section 4.3(b), Target may participate in
discussions with, request clarifications from, or furnish information to, any
Person which makes an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal if (1) such action is
taken subject to a confidentiality agreement with the party submitting the
Acquisition Proposal containing customary terms and conditions; (2) Targets
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after receiving advice from
outside legal counsel and advice from an independent nationally recognized
investment bank that such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to
lead to, a Superior Proposal and (3) Targets Board of Directors determines
in good faith, after receiving advice from outside legal counsel, that not
participating in such discussions with, requesting such clarifications from
or furnishing such information to such Person would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under   ##### 

 

applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, Target agrees that
any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.3 by any
Target Representative or any Affiliate of Target or any Target
Representative, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of
Target, shall constitute a breach by Target of this Section 4.3. Target shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, the provisions of any standstill,
confidentiality or similar agreement entered into by it or any Target
Representative, including, where necessary, using its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court having
jurisdiction.  

 (b) Notices; Additional Negotiations. Target shall promptly advise Acquiror orally, with written confirmation to follow promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours), of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, or of any inquiry with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the identity of the person making any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Target shall not provide any information to or participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making any Acquisition Proposal until twenty-four (24) hours after Target has first notified Acquiror of such Acquisition Proposal as required by the preceding sentence. Target shall (i) keep Acquiror fully informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and details (including any change to the terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry (whether written or oral), (ii) provide to Acquiror as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to Target from any third party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or sent or provided by Target to any third party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) if Acquiror shall make a counterproposal pursuant to this Section 4.3 or otherwise, consider in good faith the terms of such counterproposal.   

 (c) Cessation of Ongoing Discussions. Target shall, and shall cause the Target Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.   

 (d) Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:   

 "Acquisition Proposal" means, with respect to Target, any offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by Acquiror) relating to any transaction or series of related transactions other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement involving: (i) any acquisition or purchase by any person or "Group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of more than a fifteen percent (15%) interest in the total outstanding voting securities of Target or any of its subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or Group beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of the total outstanding voting securities of Target or any of its subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving Target pursuant to which the stockholders of such party immediately preceding such transaction hold less than eighty five percent (85%) of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction, (ii) any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business), acquisition or disposition of more    ##### 

    

than fifteen percent (15%) of the assets of Target and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any Material Subsidiary, (iii) any
liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other significant corporate
reorganization involving more than fifteen percent (15%) of the assets of
Target and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any Material Subsidiary,
(iv) any other transaction the consummation of which could reasonably be
expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially delay the Mergers,
or (v) any public announcement by or on behalf of Target or any of the Target
Representatives or any of their Affiliates or by any third party of a
proposal, plan or intention to do any of the foregoing or any agreement to
engage in any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
merger of iWon Holdings, Inc. with and into Focus Interactive, Inc. nor the
merger of MyWay, Inc. with and into Focus Interactive, Inc. shall constitute
an Acquisition Proposal.  

 "Specified Time" means, with respect to Target, a period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending at such time as Targets stockholders have approved the Mergers and adopted this Agreement.   

 "Superior Proposal," with respect to Target shall mean a bona fide written offer not solicited in violation of Section 4.3 made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, stock purchase, asset purchase or other business combination, all or substantially all of the assets of Target and its subsidiaries or a majority of the total outstanding voting securities of Target and as a result of which the stockholders of Target immediately preceding such transaction would hold less than fifty percent (50%) of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction or any direct or indirect parent or subsidiary thereof, on terms that Targets Board of Directors has in good faith concluded (following the receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor), taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the offer and the Person making the offer, to be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to Targets stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) than the terms of the Mergers and is reasonably capable of being consummated, taking into account such factors as the Target Board of Directors in good faith deems relevant, including, without limitation, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal (including the terms of any financing and the likelihood that the transaction would be consummated and the identity of the Person making such proposal) and which is not conditioned on any financing.   

 (e) Except as otherwise permitted by this Section 4.3(e), Target, through its Board of Directors, shall (i) recommend adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Mergers, (ii) not withdraw, withhold, modify, or change such recommendation in a manner adverse to Acquiror, (iii) not recommend or declare advisable any Superior Proposal, and (iv) take all action necessary or advisable to obtain the vote of Targets stockholders required to effect each of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Target Board of Directors may at any time prior to obtaining stockholder adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Mergers withdraw, withhold, modify, or change, in a manner adverse to Acquiror, any approval or recommendation regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (any such actions being referred to herein as "Adverse Actions"), if its Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that the failure to take the Adverse Action in question would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable law. After Targets Board of Directors has made a determination to take an Adverse Action pursuant     ##### 

    

to the previous sentence but at least three (3) business days prior to taking
such Adverse Action, Target shall give Acquiror written notice of Targets
intention to take such Adverse Action (including a reasonable description of
the circumstances related thereto) so as to allow Acquiror to propose a
modification to the terms of the Mergers or this Agreement that
would eliminate the need to take the Adverse Action. In the event that
Acquiror proposes to Target any modifications to the terms of the Mergers or
this Agreement during such three (3) business day period (the "Modified
Terms"), Target shall not take the Adverse Action unless and until the Board
of Directors of Target (i) in good faith considers the Modified Terms and
(ii) makes a good faith determination, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that proceeding with a transaction with Acquiror reflecting
the Modified Terms would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations
under applicable law. Notwithstanding any Adverse Action taken by Target,
Target shall be obligated to submit the matters to be voted on by such
stockholders (as contemplated hereby) to the stockholders of Target at the
Target Stockholders Meeting and, in connection with such submission,
communicate the circumstances under which the matters to be voted on by such
stockholders (as contemplated hereby) are being submitted to its
stockholders. Target shall  promptly furnish Acquiror current, accurate and
complete lists of the stockholders of Target as may be requested by Acquiror
from time to time so that Acquiror can solicit Targets stockholders.

upon Acquiror and Target, their respective subsidiaries and their respective

To the extent permitted by Acquirors employee benefit programs, each such Surviving Company eligible employee will be allowed to participate in Acquirors employee benefit programs and other individual benefits available to all other similarly situated Acquiror employees, such as life insurance, health, medical, dental and vision coverage and Acquirors 401(k) Plan (collectively, "Acquiror Plans"). Except as otherwise agreed by Acquiror in writing, all Target employees who become Surviving Company employees, shall continue to be "at will" employees and may be terminated by the Surviving Company at any time for any reason or for no reason. With respect to any Acquiror Plans in which the employees of Target who become Surviving Company employees participate subsequent to the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by the terms of such plans, Acquiror shall (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions applicable to such employees to the same extent such exclusions would have been waived under the Target Employee Plans prior to the Effective Time and (ii) recognize all service of such Target    #####

any Acquiror Plan in which such employees may be eligible to participate
after the Effective Time to the same extent taken into account (except as to

time) under the Target Employee Plans in which such employees participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time.  

 (b) Target shall terminate each and every Employee Plan that includes a "qualified cash or deferred arrangement" within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (each, a "Target 401(k) Plan").

 5.15 Step Two Merger. If the Step One Merger occurs, LLC, Target (including the Interim Surviving Corporation) and Acquiror shall take all actions, and do or cause to be done all things necessary or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to effect the consummation of the Step Two Merger immediately following the Effective Time on the Closing Date.

 (b) Post-Closing Actions. After the Effective Time, neither Acquiror, Merger Sub, LLC nor any of their respective Affiliates nor any of Targets Affiliates immediately prior to the Effective Time shall take or agree to take any action that would reasonably be likely to prevent the Mergers from together qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Code.   

 5.17 Notices. Target shall give all notices and other information required to be given to the employees of Target, and any applicable Governmental Entity under the WARN Act, the Internal Revenue Code, COBRA, and other applicable law in connection with the transactions provided for in this Agreement.    ##### 

  

 5.18 Indemnification; Exculpation; Insurance.   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror will cause to be recognized in all respects the obligations of Target (i) with respect to indemnification pursuant to any indemnification agreements between Target and its directors and officers (the "Indemnified Parties") in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) under Targets Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, in both cases (i) and (ii), as in effect on the date hereof. The Operating Agreement of the Surviving Company will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Target Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by law.   

 (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Acquiror will cause the Surviving Company to maintain in effect, if available, directors and officers liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by Targets directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms no less favorable on the whole to the Indemnified Parties than those applicable to the current directors and officers of Target; provided, however, that in no event will Acquiror or the Surviving Company be required to expend an annual premium for such coverage in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the annual premium currently paid by Target.   

 (c) If Acquiror, the Surviving Company or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Acquiror or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.18.   

 (d) This Section 5.18 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Acquiror and the Surviving Company and their successors and assigns.   

 5.19 Zero Priced Options. Prior to the Effective Time, Target shall take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to (i) cause all Zero Priced Options to be either exercised prior to the Effective Time or cancelled prior to or at the Effective Time, and (ii) to cause all shares of Target Common Stock issued upon exercise of the Zero Priced Options to be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, including receiving payment of at least the par value of such shares and having its Board of Directors duly adopt resolutions determining that, upon payment of such par value, such shares are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.   

 5.20 Tax Claims. Within thirty (30) days of the date of this Agreement, Target shall enter into negotiations with the IRS for a final settlement with respect to its and its optionholders tax treatment of the Zero Priced Options. Prior to the Effective Time, Target shall use reasonable commercial efforts to enter into a final settlement with the IRS with respect to such treatment. After the Effective Time, the Stockholders Representative, or Acquiror at the    ##### 

 

Stockholders Representatives request, shall continue to use
reasonable commercial efforts to obtain such a settlement. Neither Target nor
the Stockholders Representative shall abandon such efforts until the IRS
and Target or the Stockholders Representative, as applicable, have
negotiated and entered into a closing agreement to settle any amounts due to
the IRS or any other Governmental Entity related to Targets and Targets
optionholders tax treatment of Zero Priced Options ("Tax Claims"). The
Stockholders Representative (or Acquiror, if applicable) shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any such closing agreement
shall provide for no liability on behalf of former Target optionholders in
excess of the amount for which such optionholders would have been liable had
the IRS accepted Targets initial tax treatment of the Zero Priced Options.
All costs and expenses of pursuing such a closing agreement (including the
fees and expenses of counsel and other advisors) (the "Settlement Expenses")
shall be charged to and paid from the Special Escrow Fund. If the
Stockholders Representative and the IRS agree to a settlement of the Tax
Claims in an amount not in excess of the Special Escrow Fund less the amount
of the Settlement Expenses, and upon other terms that do not materially
adversely affect the Surviving Company, the Surviving Company shall enter
into such closing agreement with the IRS and Acquiror shall be entitled to
recover such amount from the Special Escrow Fund in accordance with Section
8.7. Any other settlement shall require the consent of the Surviving Company,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
provided that refusal to consent to a settlement in excess of the amount
available in the Special Escrow Fund shall not be considered
unreasonable.  

 5.21 Targeted Media Solutions. Prior to the Effective Time, Target shall exercise its rights to purchase, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to complete such purchase of, all membership interests in Targeted Media Solutions, LLC not owned by Target or Focus Interactive, Inc.

 7.5 Amendment. The Boards of Directors of the parties may cause this Agreement to be amended at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties; provided that no amendment shall be made after stockholder approval hereof which by law requires the further approval of stockholders without such further approval.

At any time prior to the Effective Time any party may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein; provided, however, that if Target waives the satisfaction of the condition in Section 6.2(h), Acquiror shall be required to waive the satisfaction of the condition in Section 6.3(q). Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.   

ARTICLE EIGHT   

Escrow and Indemnification   

 8.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All covenants and agreements to be performed prior to the Effective Time (except as otherwise contemplated herein), and all representations and warranties in this Agreement shall survive the consummation of the Mergers and continue until fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date (the "Escrow Termination Date"); provided that if any bona fide claims for indemnification have been asserted by delivery of an Officers Certificate in accordance with the Escrow Agreement with respect to any such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements prior to the Escrow Termination Date, such claims shall continue in effect until final resolution of such claims, and provided further that the right to indemnification under this Article Eight for Tax Claims shall continue until the termination of the Special Escrow Fund. All covenants and agreements to be performed after the Effective Time shall continue in accordance with their terms.   

 8.2 Escrow Fund. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, without any act of any stockholder of Target, a portion of the Stock Consideration consisting of 930,000 shares of Acquiror Common Stock that holders of vested Target Capital Stock are entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(a) (such shares being the "Initial Escrow Shares" and, together with the New Shares, the "Escrow Shares") and Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) of the Cash Consideration (the "Escrow Cash") shall be deposited with Comerica Bank (or such other institution selected by Acquiror) as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), such deposit to constitute the "Escrow Fund" and to be governed by the terms set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement. Each former Target stockholders proportionate interest in the Initial Escrow Shares deposited into the Escrow Fund shall be based on such stockholders proportionate interest in the Stock Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.6(a), and each former Target stockholders proportionate interest in the Escrow Cash shall be based on such stockholders interest in the Cash Consideration. The Escrow Shares shall be registered in the name of the Escrow Agent for so long as they constitute part of the Escrow Fund.    ##### 

  

 8.3 Indemnification.   

 (a) Indemnified Damages. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article Eight, from and after the Effective Time, the former stockholders of Target shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Acquiror, the Interim Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company and their respective affiliates, officers, directors, managers, members, employees, representatives and agents and each Person, if any, who controls Acquiror within the meaning of the Securities Act (Acquiror, the Interim Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company and each of the foregoing Persons is hereinafter referred to individually as an "Indemnified Person" and collectively as "Indemnified Persons") from and against any and all actual losses, costs, damages, liabilities, fees (including without limitation reasonable attorneys fees) and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation) (collectively, the "Damages"), that any of the Indemnified Persons incurs by reason of or as a result of (i) any misrepresentation, breach or default of, any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Target contained in this Agreement, including any exhibits, schedules, closing certificates furnished by Target or the Target Disclosure Schedule delivered pursuant hereto, for which the Indemnified Person delivers a timely written notice pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, (ii) any Excess Merger Fees that are not deducted from the Cash Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to Sections 1.6 and 7.4, (iii) Tax Claims or (iv) fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Target or any of its subsidiaries. Damages in each case shall be net of the amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnity and contribution actually recovered by the Indemnified Person (reduced by any Tax cost to the Indemnified Person as a result of the indemnity payments). In addition, Damages shall be reduced (at the time and in the manner discussed in the following sentence) to take account of the amount of any Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Person or any Affiliate or group of Affiliates of such Indemnified Person arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages. In computing the amount of any such Tax benefit, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to realize a Tax benefit on (i) the date on which the Tax benefit is received as a refund of Taxes, or (ii) to the extent that the Tax benefit is not received as a refund of Taxes but rather is claimed as an item that reduces liability for Taxes (determined on a with and without basis), the due date (including extensions) of the Tax Return that reflects such change in liability for Taxes, in each case, based on the Indemnified Persons good faith determination.   

 (b) Limitations. Liability of the Target stockholders shall be several and not joint and the maximum liability of any former holder of the Target Capital Stock for any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Target shall be limited to and paid solely from such stockholders proportionate interest in the Escrow Fund and, with respect to Tax Claims, the Special Escrow Fund; provided, however, that the liability of any Target stockholder for the fraud or intentional misrepresentation of Target, any of its subsidiaries or any director, officer or stockholder of Target or any of its subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall not be limited to the Escrow Fund and the Special Escrow Fund provided that such Person shall not be liable for Damages for such fraud or intentional misrepresentation in excess of the  portion of the sum of the Merger Consideration, Additional Stock Consideration, if applicable, Earn-out Consideration, if applicable, and Series A Dividend received or to be received by such Target stockholder hereunder.    ##### 

    

 8.4 Damages Threshold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquiror may not receive any of the Escrow Shares or Escrow Cash from the Escrow Fund under Section 8.3(a)(i) unless and until a certificate signed by an officer of Acquiror (an "Officers Certificate") identifying Damages in the aggregate amount in excess of $1,000,000 has been delivered to the Escrow Agent and such amount is determined pursuant to this Article Eight and the Escrow Agreement to be payable, in which case Acquiror shall receive shares (valued at the Closing Price, as adjusted for stock splits, dividends and the like) and cash from the Escrow Fund equal in value to the full amount of all Damages incurred (including such $1,000,000), as provided in Section 8.8 below.   

 8.5 Escrow Period. The period during which claims for indemnification from the Escrow Fund may be initiated (the "Claims Period") shall commence at the Effective Time and terminate on the Escrow Termination Date. Upon the expiration of the Claims Period, the Escrow Fund shall terminate with respect to all Escrow Shares and Escrow Cash in the Escrow Fund at such time; provided, however, that the number of Escrow Shares and the amount of Escrow Cash, which, subject to the provisions of this Article Eight and the Escrow Agreement (including any objection of the Stockholders Representative in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement), are necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any Officers Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of such Escrow Period shall remain in the Escrow Fund (and the Escrow Fund shall remain in existence) until such claims have been resolved. As such claims are resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the stockholders of Target all Escrow Shares, Escrow Cash and other property remaining in the Escrow Fund and not required to satisfy such resolved claims or any remaining unresolved claims. Deliveries of Escrow Shares and Escrow Cash to the stockholders of Target pursuant to this Section 8.5 and the Escrow Agreement shall be made in proportion to their respective original contributions to the Escrow Fund.   

 8.6 Distributions; Voting.   

 (a) Any shares of Acquiror Common Stock or other Acquiror equity securities (including shares issued upon a stock split) ("New Shares") issued or distributed by Acquiror in respect of the Escrow Shares or the Special Escrow Shares that have not been released from the Escrow Fund or the Special Escrow Fund, as the case may be, shall be added to the Escrow Fund or the Special Escrow Fund, as applicable, and become a part thereof; provided, however, any other dividends or distributions on the Escrow Shares (including on the New Shares) or the Special Escrow Shares (including on the New Shares) made in cash or property shall be currently distributed to the beneficial owners of such shares. The beneficial owners of the Escrow Shares shall pay any taxes on such dividends.   

 (b) The parties hereto shall cause each former stockholder of Target to have the ability to direct the voting of that number of Escrow Shares contributed to the Escrow Fund and that number of Special Escrow Shares contributed to the Special Escrow Fund on behalf of such stockholder (and on any New Shares) so long as such shares are held in the Escrow Fund or the Special Escrow Fund, as the case may be. As the record holder of such shares, the Escrow Agent shall vote such shares in accordance with the instructions of the former stockholders of Target having the beneficial interest therein and shall promptly deliver copies of all proxy solicitation materials to such stockholders. Acquiror shall show the Acquiror Common    ##### 

 

Stock contributed to the Escrow Fund and the Special Escrow Fund as
issued and outstanding on its balance sheet.  

 8.7 Special Escrow Fund. If as of the Effective Time there has not been a settlement or closing agreement executed by Target and the IRS with respect to the Tax Claims or Target has not resolved such Tax Claims with no liability or ongoing obligation of Acquiror or the Surviving Company, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, without any act of any stockholder of Target, a portion of the Stock Consideration consisting of 232,500 shares of Acquiror Common Stock that holders of vested Target Capital Stock are entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(a) (such shares being the "Initial Special Escrow Shares" and, together with the New Shares, the "Special Escrow Shares") and Three Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($3,750,000) of the Cash Consideration (the "Special Escrow Cash") shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent, such deposit to constitute the "Special Escrow Fund" and to be governed by the terms set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement. Each former Target stockholders proportionate interest in the Special Escrow Shares deposited into the Special Escrow Fund shall be based on such stockholders proportionate interest in the Stock Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.6(a), and each former Target stockholders proportionate interest in the Special Escrow Cash deposited in the Special Escrow Fund shall be based on such stockholders proportionate interest in the Cash Consideration. The Special Escrow Shares deposited into the Special Escrow Fund shall be registered in the name of the Escrow Agent for so long as they constitute part of the Special Escrow Fund. The Special Escrow Fund shall remain in place until all Tax Claims have been finally resolved in accordance with Section 5.20. Upon any such final resolution, Acquiror shall be entitled to receive Special Escrow Cash and Special Escrow Shares from the Special Escrow Fund in an amount equal to any amounts paid or payable by Acquiror or the Surviving Company to the IRS or any other Governmental Entity or taxing authority with respect to the Tax Claims and Acquirors reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) actually incurred in connection with the Tax Claims. To the extent Special Escrow Cash or Special Escrow Shares remain in the Special Escrow Fund after all such payments to Acquiror, the Special Escrow Fund shall be promptly distributed pro rata among the former Target stockholders based on the proportionate interest of each such stockholder. Claims against the Special Escrow Fund shall be made in accordance with Section 8.8 and the Escrow Agreement, except that, in the event such final resolution involves payments to the IRS or any other Taxing authority or if Acquiror or the Surviving Company have incurred expenses for which claims can be made against the Special Escrow Fund, the Stockholders Representative shall not be entitled to contest the existence of the Tax Claims. In addition, the Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to control the process of resolving the Tax Claims provided that the Stockholders Representative shall not voluntarily resolve any or all Tax Claims in a manner that would result in aggregate payments therefor in excess of the Special Escrow Fund without Acquirors prior written consent. The Special Escrow Cash in the Special Escrow Fund shall be invested in the same manner as the Escrow Cash. Interest and income on the Special Escrow Fund shall remain in and become a part of the Special Escrow Fund.   

 8.8 Method of Asserting Claims. All claims for indemnification by Acquiror, the Surviving Company or any other Indemnified Person pursuant to this Article Eight shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement. Any claims against the Escrow Fund shall be satisfied by Escrow Shares, valued at the Closing Price (as adjusted for    ##### 

    

    stock splits, dividends, combinations and the like), and Escrow Cash,
and any claims against the Special Escrow Fund shall be satisfied by Special
Escrow Shares valued at the Closing Price (as adjusted for stock splits,
dividends, combinations and the like) and Special Escrow Cash constituting
the Special Escrow Fund. The number of Escrow Shares or Special Escrow
Shares, as applicable, that shall be used to satisfy any such claim shall be
equal to the quotient of (a) the product of (i) the amount of the claim and
(ii) a fraction the numerator of which is equal to (A) the Closing Price
multiplied by (B) the Stock Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.6(a)
and the denominator of which is equal to the sum of the Cash Consideration
and the value of the Stock Consideration (with each share of Acquiror Common
Stock valued at the Closing Price) and (b) the Closing Price. The amount of
Escrow Cash or Special Escrow Cash that shall be used to satisfy any such
claim, as applicable, shall be equal to the product of (i) the amount of the
claim and (ii) a fraction the numerator of which is equal to the Cash
Consideration and the denominator of which is equal to the sum of the Cash
Consideration and the value of the Stock Consideration (with each share of
Acquiror Common Stock valued at the Closing Price).  
--- 
  

 8.9 Representative of the Stockholders; Power of Attorney. At the Effective Time, Stephen Murray shall be constituted and appointed, without further act of any stockholder of Target, as agent and attorney-in-fact (the "Stockholders Representative") for each stockholder of Target (except such stockholders, if any, as shall have perfected their appraisal rights under Delaware Law), for and on behalf of stockholders of Target, (i) to give and receive notices and communications on behalf of Target stockholders, (ii) to enter into and perform the Escrow Agreement, (iii) to authorize delivery to Acquiror of Escrow Shares, Escrow Cash or other property from the Escrow Fund and Special Escrow Shares, Escrow Cash or other property from the Special Escrow Fund, as applicable, in satisfaction of claims by Acquiror or any other Indemnified Person, (iv) to object to such deliveries and any claims set forth in any Officers Certificate, (v) to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims or any other claims against any Target stockholder or by any such stockholder against any Indemnified Person, in each case relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and (vi) to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of Stockholders Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case without having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under any circumstance. The Stockholders Representative shall not be personally liable or responsible to the former Target stockholders for any act he may do or omit to do hereunder so long as the Stockholders Representative. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Stockholders Representative shall not incur any liability with respect to any action taken or suffered by him in reliance upon any note, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other document believed by him to be genuinely and duly authorized, nor for any action or inaction in reliance in good faith upon advice of legal counsel. If the Stockholders Representative shall die, become disabled or otherwise be unable to fulfill his responsibilities hereunder, former Target stockholders with an interest in the Escrow Fund and the Special Escrow Fund shall, by consent of former Target stockholders that hold at least a majority of the Escrow Shares then held in the Escrow Fund and Special Escrow Shares in the Special Escrow Fund within ten (10) days after such death or disability, appoint a successor to the Stockholders Representative and immediately thereafter notify Acquiror of the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall succeed the Stockholders Representative as Stockholders Representative hereunder.    ##### 

  

 8.10 Adjustment to Escrow. In the event that Acquiror pays out any amounts to holders of Dissenting Shares with respect to such shares, the Escrow Shares and Escrow Cash shall be automatically reduced by the number of Escrow Shares (including any New Shares issued with respect thereto) and amount of Escrow Cash contributed to the Escrow Fund with respect to such Dissenting Shares, and the Special Escrow Shares and Special Escrow Cash shall be automatically reduced by the number of Special Escrow Shares (including any New Shares) and amount of Special Escrow Cash contributed to the Special Escrow Fund with respect to such Dissenting Shares. Upon certification by the Acquiror to the Escrow Agent of such event, the Escrow Shares, any New Shares and the Escrow Cash contributed to the Escrow Fund, and the Special Escrow Shares, any New Shares and Special Escrow Cash contributed to the Special Escrow Fund, in each case, with respect to such Dissenting Shares shall be promptly returned to Acquiror.

Unless the context otherwise requires, references to "Target stockholders", "stockholders of Target", "former Target stockholders", "former stockholders of Target" and similar phrases, mean the stockholders of Target immediately prior to the Effective Time.   

 In this Agreement, any reference to a "Material Adverse Effect" with respect to any entity or group of entities means any event, change or effect that (i) is or is reasonably likely to be, materially adverse to the condition (financial or otherwise), properties, assets, liabilities, business, operations or results of operations of such entity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,   ##### 

 

or (ii) will prevent or materially delay consummation of the Mergers
or otherwise will prevent such entity and its subsidiaries from performing
their  obligations under this Agreement or (iii) makes the operation of any
material portion of the businesses of Target and its subsidiaries by
Acquiror, the Interim Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company illegal;

not include any changes resulting from or in connection with litigation
commenced by such party (or any Affiliate of such party) against Target or
any of its subsidiaries arising out of the actions or omissions of Target or
any of its Affiliates other than actions or omissions taken at the express
request or with the express consent of Acquiror which would be reasonably

dispute and (ii) for a written decision by the mediator that includes the
essential findings and conclusions upon which the decision is based. Any such
mediation shall be held in the San Francisco Bay Area. Target and Acquiror

 9.4 Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including the Exhibits, the Schedules, including the Target Disclosure Schedule and the Acquiror Disclosure Schedule (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the Closing, in accordance with its terms; and (b) are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (i) upon the Target stockholders with respect to a breach of Section 5.15 or 5.16(b) by Acquiror, Merger Sub or the LLC and (ii) as set forth in Sections 5.18 and 8.9.   

 Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise (except in connection with the Mergers or as otherwise specifically provided herein) by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.  

 9.5 Severability.

In the event that the parties cannot reach a mutually agreeable and enforceable replacement for such provision, then (i) such provision shall be excluded from this Agreement, (ii) the balance of the Agreement shall be interpreted as if such provision were so excluded and (iii) the balance of the Agreement shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.   

 9.6 Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.    #####
