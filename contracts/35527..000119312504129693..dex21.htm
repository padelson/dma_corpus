(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with
the General Corporation Law of the State of Ohio (the " _OGCL_ ") and the
Business Corporation Act of the State of Florida (the " _FBCA_ "), at the
Effective Time (as defined below), First National Bankshares shall merge with
and into Fifth Third. Fifth Third shall be the Surviving Corporation in the

of Ohio. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
First National Bankshares shall terminate.



(b) Fifth Third may at any time change the method of effecting the
combination of First National Bankshares and Fifth Third including without
limitation the provisions of this _Article I_ , if and to the extent it deems
such change to be desirable, including without limitation to provide for
a merger of First National Bankshares with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Fifth Third or the merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fifth Third with
and into First National Bankshares; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
change shall (i) alter or change the amount or type of Merger Consideration
(as defined below) to be provided to holders of First National Bankshares
Common Stock (as defined below) as provided for in this Agreement, (ii) cause
the combination to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code or adversely affect the tax treatment of holders of
First National Bankshares Common Stock as a result of receiving the Merger
Consideration, or (iii) materially impede or delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. First National Bankshares shall,
if requested by Fifth Third, enter into one or more amendments to this
Agreement prior to the Effective Time in order to effect any such change. 



1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") that shall be filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio (the " _Ohio Secretary_ ")
and the articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") that shall be filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida (the " _Florida Secretary_
") on the Closing Date. The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and

Merger and the Articles of Merger.

have the effects set forth in the OGCL and the FBCA.

Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of First
National Bankshares, Fifth Third or the holder of any of the securities of
either First National Bankshares or Fifth Third:



(a) Subject to _Section 2.2(e)_ , each share of the common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of First National Bankshares (the " _First National
Bankshares Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except for shares of First National Bankshares Common Stock
owned by First National Bankshares or Fifth Third (other than shares of First
National Bankshares Common Stock held in trust accounts, managed accounts and
the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity, that are beneficially
owned by third parties (any such shares held by First National Bankshares or
Fifth Third, as the case may be, being referred to herein as " _Trust Account
Shares_ ") or shares of First National Bankshares Common Stock held on account
of a debt previously contracted (" _DPC Shares_ ")) shall be converted into
the right to receive .5065 of a share (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of the common
stock, no par value per share, of Fifth Third (the "Fifth Third Common Stock")
(the " _Merger Consideration_ ").



(b) All of the shares of First National Bankshares Common Stock converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article
I_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate
previously representing any such shares of First National Bankshares Common
Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive (i) a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Fifth
Third Common Stock, and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares, into which the
shares of First National Bankshares Common Stock represented by such
Certificate have been converted pursuant to this _Section 1.4_ and
_Section 2.2(e)_. Certificates previously representing shares of First
National Bankshares Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates
representing whole shares of Fifth Third Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
Certificates in accordance with _Section 2.2_ , without any interest thereon.
If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Fifth Third Common
Stock or First National Bankshares Common Stock shall have been increased,
decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares
or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment
shall be made to the Exchange Ratio.



(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of First National Bankshares Capital Stock (as
defined below) that are owned by First National Bankshares or Fifth Third
(other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.



1.5 _Fifth Third Capital Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share
of Fifth Third Capital Stock (as defined below) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing Date shall remain issued and outstanding and
shall not be affected by the Merger.



 

-3- 1.6 _Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.



(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each then outstanding option
to purchase shares of First National Bankshares Common Stock (each a " _First
National Bankshares Stock Option_ ") granted pursuant to the equity-based
compensation plans identified in Section 4.11 of the First National
Bankshares Disclosure Schedule (the " _First National Bankshares Stock Plans_
") to any current or former employee or director of, or consultant to, First
National Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries shall be assumed by Fifth Third
and shall be converted automatically into an option to purchase a number of
shares of Fifth Third Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) (an "
_Assumed Stock Option_ ") at an exercise price determined as provided below
(and otherwise subject to the terms of the First National Bankshares Stock
Plans and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder):



(i) The number of shares of Fifth Third Common Stock to be subject to the
Assumed Stock Option shall be equal to the product of the number of shares
of First National Bankshares Common Stock subject to the First National
Bankshares Stock Option and Exchange Ratio, _provided_ that any fractional
shares of Fifth Third Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be
rounded to the nearest whole share; and



(ii) The exercise price per share of Fifth Third Common Stock under the
Assumed Stock Option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of First
National Bankshares Common Stock under the First National Bankshares Stock
Option divided by the Exchange Ratio, _provided_ that such exercise price
shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent.



In the case of any First National Bankshares Stock Option to which Section
421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of
the Code, the conversion formula shall be adjusted, if necessary, to comply
with Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
Assumed Stock Options shall be subject to the same terms and conditions
(including expiration date, vesting and exercise provisions) as were
applicable to the corresponding First National Bankshares Stock Options
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but taking into account any non-
discretionary changes thereto provided for in the First National Bankshares
Stock Plans or other First National Bankshares Benefit Plan (defined below) or
in any award agreement thereunder by reason of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby); provided, however, that references to First
National Bankshares shall be deemed to be references to Fifth Third.



(b) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued,
to receive shares of First National Bankshares Common Stock or benefits
measured by the value of a number of shares of First National Bankshares
Common Stock, and each award of any kind consisting of shares of First
National Bankshares Common Stock, granted under the First National Bankshares
Stock Plans or any other First National Bankshares Benefit Plan (including
restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units, deferred
stock units, phantom stock and dividend equivalents), other than First
National Bankshares Stock Options (each, a " _First National Bankshares Stock-
Based Award_ "), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding or
unsatisfied immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall cease to represent
a right or award with respect to shares of First National Bankshares Common
Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into a right or award
with respect to shares of Fifth Third  



 

-4-  Common Stock (an " _Assumed Stock-Based Award_ "), on the same terms and
conditions (including expiration date, vesting and exercise provisions) as
were applicable under the First National Bankshares Stock-Based Awards (but
taking into account any non-discretionary changes thereto provided for in the
First National Bankshares Stock Plans or other First National Bankshares
Benefit Plan or in any award agreement thereunder by reason of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby). The number of shares of Fifth Third
Common Stock subject to each such Assumed Stock-Based Award shall be equal to
the number of shares of First National Bankshares Common Stock subject to the
First National Bankshares Stock-Based Award, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
(rounded to the nearest whole share of Fifth Third Common Stock). All dividend
equivalents credited to the account of each holder of a First National
Bankshares Stock-Based Award as of the Effective Time shall remain credited to
such holders account immediately following the Effective Time, subject to
adjustment in accordance with the foregoing.



(c) Fifth Third represents and warrants that it has taken all
corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Fifth Third Common Stock upon the exercise of the Assumed Stock
Options. On or as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Fifth Third
shall file a registration statement on an appropriate form or a post-
effective amendment to a previously filed registration statement under the
Securities Act (defined below) with respect to the issuance of the shares of
Fifth Third Common Stock subject to the Assumed Stock Options and the Assumed
Stock-Based Awards and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such equity awards remain outstanding.



(d) Within twenty (20) business days of the date hereof, First National
Bankshares will take such action as is necessary to amend the First National
Bankshares Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the " _First National Bankshares DRIP_
") to eliminate or suspend, pending the consummation of the Merger, the right
of any participant to make a new election, or increase an existing election,
to purchase additional shares of First National Bankshares Common Stock under
the First National Bankshares DRIP other than upon a dividend reinvestment;
_provided, however,_ that those participants who have made such an election
prior to the date of this Agreement shall be permitted to purchase additional
shares of First National Bankshares Common Stock under the First National
Bankshares DRIP pursuant to such existing election. Prior to the Effective
Time and within five (5) business days of the anticipated Effective Time,
First National Bankshares will take such action as is necessary to provide no
additional shares of First National Bankshares Common Stock will be purchased
under the First National Bankshares DRIP. Immediately prior to and effective
as of the Effective Time and subject to the consummation of the Merger, First
National Bankshares shall terminate the First National Bankshares DRIP.



1.7 _Articles of Incorporation_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Fifth Third
(the " _Fifth Third Articles_ "), shall be the Articles of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with
applicable law.



 

-5- 1.8 _Code of Regulations_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Code of Regulations of Fifth Third
shall be the Code of Regulations of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable law.



1.9 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization," within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g) as defined in Section 368 of the
Code, for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.



1.10 _Headquarters of Surviving Corporation._ From and after the Effective
Time, the location of the headquarters and principal executive offices of the
Surviving Corporation shall be that of the headquarters and principal
executive offices of Fifth Third as of the date of this Agreement.



1.11 _Board of Directors._ At the Effective Time, the directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be comprised of the directors of Fifth Third.



ARTICLE II.

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION



2.1 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Fifth Third shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with Computershare
Trust Company of New York, or a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
Fifth Third (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders
of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_ ,
certificates representing the shares of Fifth Third Common Stock and cash in
lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of Fifth
Third Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), to be
issued pursuant to _Section 1.4_ and paid pursuant to _Section 1.4_ and
_Section 2.2(e)_  in exchange for outstanding shares of First National
Bankshares Common Stock.



2.2 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.



(a) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than fifteen business days,
after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of
record of one or more Certificates a letter of transmittal in customary form
as reasonably agreed by the parties (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
certificates representing the shares of Fifth Third Common Stock and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of First National
Bankshares Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall
have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Upon proper surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and cancellation,
together with such properly completed and duly executed letter of
transmittal, the holder of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing
that number of whole shares of Fifth Third Common Stock to which such holder
of First National Bankshares Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant
to the provisions of _Article I_ and (ii) a check representing the sum of the
amount of any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has  



 

-6-  the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ , and the
Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or
on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates.



(b) No dividends or other distributions declared _after the Effective Time_
with respect to Fifth Third Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_. After the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_ , the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to shares of Fifth Third Common Stock represented by such
Certificate.



(c) If any certificate representing shares of Fifth Third Common Stock is to
be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition
of the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
representing shares of Fifth Third Common Stock in any name other than that of
the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or
required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.



(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of First National Bankshares of the shares of First
National Bankshares Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, certificates
representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged for certificates representing shares of
Fifth Third Common Stock and Cash Consideration as provided in this _Article
II_.



(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Fifth Third Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or
distribution with respect to Fifth Third Common Stock shall be payable on or
with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
shareholder of Fifth Third. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Fifth Third shall pay to each former shareholder of First National
Bankshares who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share
an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing-
sale prices of Fifth Third Common Stock on the securities market or stock
exchange in which the Fifth Third Common Stock principally trades,
as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ for the ten consecutive trading days
ending on the fifth trading day immediately preceding the date of the
Effective Time by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Fifth Third Common Stock to
which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section
1.4_.



 

-7- (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of First National Bankshares as of the first anniversary of the
Effective Time shall be paid to Fifth Third. Any former shareholders of First
National Bankshares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_
shall thereafter look only to Fifth Third for payment of the shares of Fifth
Third Common Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid
dividends and distributions on the Fifth Third Common Stock deliverable in
respect of each share of First National Bankshares Common Stock such
shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of First
National Bankshares, Fifth Third, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall
be liable to any former holder of shares of First National Bankshares Common
Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.



(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by Fifth Third, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount
as Fifth Third may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the shares of Fifth Third Common Stock and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.



ARTICLE III.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF FIFTH THIRD



Except as otherwise disclosed in (a) the Fifth Third _Reports (as _ defined
below) filed prior to the date hereof or (b) the disclosure schedule (the "
_Fifth Third Disclosure Schedule"_ ) delivered by Fifth Third to First
National Bankshares prior to the execution of this Agreement (which
schedule sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is
necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more
representations or warranties contained in this _Article III_ or to one or
more of Fifth Thirds covenants contained in _Article V_ , _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
(i) no such item is required to be set forth in such schedule as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard
established by _Section 9.2_ , (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in such
schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed
an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item has had or would be reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) on Fifth Third and (iii)
items shall be disclosed on such schedule under enumerated portions of such
schedule corresponding to the section of this Agreement to which
such disclosure relates (provided that disclosure under any enumerated
portion of such schedule shall be deemed to apply to any other section of this
Agreement to which it is readily apparent from the face of such disclosure
that such disclosure applies), Fifth Third hereby represents and warrants to
First National Bankshares as follows:



 

-8- 3.1 _Corporate Organization_.



(a) Fifth Third is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Ohio. Fifth Third has the corporate
power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Fifth
Third. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ "
means, with respect to First National Bankshares, Fifth Third or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, a material adverse effect _, when considered
individually or in the aggregate,_ on (i) the business, operations, results of
operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect
to clause (i), the following shall not be deemed to have a Material Adverse
Effect: any change or event caused by or resulting from (A) changes in
prevailing interest rates, currency exchange rates or other economic or
monetary conditions in the United States or elsewhere, (B) changes in United
States or foreign securities markets, including changes in price levels
or trading volumes, (C) changes or events, after the date hereof, affecting
the financial services industry generally and not specifically relating to
Fifth Third or First National Bankshares or their respective Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, (D) changes, after the date hereof, in generally accepted
accounting principles or regulatory accounting requirements applicable to
banks or savings associations and their holding companies generally, (E)
changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general
applicability or interpretations thereof by any Governmental Entity (as
defined below), (F) actions or omissions of Fifth Third or First National
Bankshares taken with the prior written consent of the other or
required hereunder, (G) any outbreak of major hostilities in which the United
States is involved or any act of terrorism within the United States or
directed against its facilities or citizens wherever located; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in no event shall a change in the trading prices of a
partys capital stock, by itself, constitute a Material Adverse Effect.



(b) Fifth Third is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended (the " _BHC Act_ "), which has duly elected
to become, and meets the applicable requirements for qualification as, a
financial holding company pursuant to Section 4(l) of the BHC Act. True and
complete copies of the Fifth Third Articles and Code of Regulations of Fifth
Third, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been

(c) Each Fifth Third Subsidiary (i) is duly organized and validly existing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly qualified
to do business and in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal,
state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the
conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in which the
failure to be so qualified would have a Material Adverse Effect on Fifth
Third and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or
lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted,
except to the extent that the failure to have such power or authority will
not result in a Material Adverse Effect on Fifth Third. As used in this
Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any party means
any bank, savings bank,  



 

-9-  corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other organization,
whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is or should be consolidated
with such party for financial reporting purposes under GAAP (as defined

initiated any proceeding or, to the best knowledge of Fifth Third,

Material Adverse Effect on Fifth Third. There is no unresolved notice
of violation, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency _or other
Governmental Entity_ with respect to any report or statement relating to any
examinations of Fifth Third or any of its Subsidiaries which, in the
reasonable judgment of Fifth Third, is reasonably likely, either individually
or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Fifth Third.



3.6 _Financial Statements_. Fifth Third has previously made available to First
National Bankshares true and correct copies of (i) the consolidated balance
sheets of Fifth Third and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001, 2002 and

Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 (the " _Fifth Third

applicable) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results
of operations, changes in shareholders equity, cash flows and financial
position of Fifth Third and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods
or as of the respective dates therein set forth, subject to normal recurring
adjustments in the case of unaudited statements; each of such statements
(including the related notes, where applicable) complies in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; and each of such statements
(including the related notes, where applicable) has been prepared in all
material respects in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States (" _GAAP_ ") consistently applied during the periods
involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the
notes thereto. The books and records of Fifth Third and its Subsidiaries have
been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with
GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect
only actual transactions.

there are no pending or, to the best of Fifth Thirds knowledge, threatened,
legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or
governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature against Fifth Third
or any of its Subsidiaries or challenging the validity or propriety of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as to which, in any such case,
there is a reasonable probability of an adverse determination and which, if
adversely determined, will be reasonably likely to, either individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Fifth Third.



(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction
(other than those that apply to similarly situated bank holding companies or
banks) imposed upon Fifth Third, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of
Fifth Third or any of its Subsidiaries that has had, or is reasonably likely
to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Fifth Third or the Surviving Corporation.



 

-13- 3.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_.



(a) Each of Fifth Third and its Subsidiaries has duly filed all federal,
state, foreign and local information returns and Tax returns required to be
filed by it on or prior to the date of this Agreement (all such returns being
accurate and complete in all material respects) and has duly paid or made
provision for the payment of all Taxes that have been incurred or are due or
claimed to be due from it by federal, state, foreign or local taxing
authorities _on or prior to the date of this Agreement_ other than (i) Taxes
or other governmental charges that are not yet delinquent or are being
contested in good faith, have not been finally determined and have been
adequately reserved against under GAAP, or (ii) information returns, Tax
returns or Taxes as to which the failure to file, pay or make provision for is
not reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Fifth Third. There are no material disputes
pending, or claims asserted, for Taxes or assessments upon Fifth Third or any
of its Subsidiaries for which Fifth Third does not have reserves that are
adequate under GAAP. Neither Fifth Third nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification
agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement
exclusively between or among Fifth Third and its Subsidiaries). Within the
past five years, neither Fifth Third nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution
intended to qualify under Section 355(a) of the Code.



(b) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Tax_ " or " _Taxes_ " means (i)

income, ad valorem, profits, gains, property, capital, sales, transfer, use,
payroll, employment, severance, withholding, duties, intangibles, franchise,
backup withholding, and other taxes, charges, levies or like assessments

final registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule and definitive

communication mailed by Fifth Third to its shareholders since January 1, 2001.
Fifth Third has filed all required reports, schedules, registration statements
and other documents with the SEC since January 1, 2001 (the " _Fifth Third
Reports_ "). As of their respective dates of filing with the SEC (or, if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of
such filing), the Fifth Third Reports complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such
Fifth Third Reports, and none of the Fifth Third Reports when filed contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Fifth
Third is in compliance with the provisions currently in effect of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the certifications provided pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 thereof are accurate.

conduct of their respective businesses under and pursuant to each, and have
complied in all material respects with and are not in default in any material
respect under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy,
agreement and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity _or SRO_ relating to
Fifth Third or any of its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to hold such
license, franchise, permit or authorization or such noncompliance or default
will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on Fifth Third.



(b) Except as will not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Fifth Third, Fifth Third and each Fifth
Third Subsidiary have properly administered all accounts for which it acts as
a fiduciary, including accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent,
custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment
advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents, applicable
state and federal law and regulation and common law.



(c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually,
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Fifth Third, each "employee
pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")), "employee welfare
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and each other plan,
agreement, program or arrangement maintained, or contributed to, for the
benefit of current or former directors or employees of Fifth Third and its
Subsidiaries or with respect to which Fifth Third or its Subsidiaries
may, directly or indirectly, have any liability to such directors or
employees (the "Fifth Third Benefit Plan") has been operated and administered
in all material respects in compliance with the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended, the Code and other applicable laws. No
Fifth Third Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan" (as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA). No proceeding has been commenced by the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation to terminate any Fifth Third Benefit Plan and no
"reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043(c) of ERISA) has occurred with
respect to a Fifth Third Benefit Plan.



3.13 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither Fifth Third nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order issued by, or
is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of
understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or similar
undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has been since
January 1, 2001, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since January
1, 2001, has adopted any board resolutions at the request of, any Regulatory
Agency or other Governmental Entity, that currently restricts in any material
respect the conduct of its business, would restrict the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or that in any material manner
relates to its capital adequacy, its credit or risk management policies, its
management or its business (each, whether or not set forth in the Fifth Third
Disclosure Schedule, a " _Fifth Third Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has Fifth
Third or any of its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2001, by any
Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity, that it is considering
issuing or requesting any such Fifth Third Regulatory Agreement.



 

-15- 3.14 _Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments_. Except as would not be
reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Fifth Third, all interest rate swaps, caps, floors
and option agreements and other interest rate risk management arrangements
(collectively, the " _Fifth Third Interest Rate Management Instruments_ "),
whether entered into for the account of Fifth Third or for the account of a
customer of Fifth Third or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the
ordinary course of business and, to Fifth Thirds knowledge, (i) in
accordance with prudent banking practice and applicable rules, regulations and
policies of any Regulatory Authority and with counterparties believed to be
financially responsible at the time, (ii) are legal, valid and
binding obligations of Fifth Third or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable in
accordance with their terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies),and (iii) are
in full force and effect. Fifth Third and each of its Subsidiaries have duly
performed in all material respects all of their material obligations under the
Fifth Third Interest Rate Management Instruments to the extent that such
obligations to perform have accrued, and to Fifth Thirds knowledge, there are
no material breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of
such by any party thereunder.



3.15 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except for those liabilities that are fully
reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Fifth Third
included in the Fifth Third Form 10-Q and for liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since March 31,
2004, neither Fifth Third nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether due or to become due) that, either individually or in
the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse
Effect on Fifth Third.



3.16  _Environmental Liability_. There are no legal, administrative, arbitral
or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental
investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of any
nature seeking to impose, or that could reasonably result in the imposition,
on Fifth Third or any Fifth Third Subsidiary any liability or obligation
arising under common law or under any local, state or federal environmental
statute, regulation, ordinance, code, order, decree or other law
(collectively, "Environmental Laws"), including, without limitation, the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,
as amended (" _CERCLA_ "), pending or, to the knowledge of Fifth Third,
threatened against Fifth Third or any Fifth Third Subsidiary, which liability
or obligation will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on Fifth Third. To the knowledge of Fifth Third, there is no
reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental
investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that will,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Fifth
Third. Neither Fifth Third nor any Fifth Third Subsidiary is subject to any
agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any court,
governmental authority, regulatory agency or third party imposing any
liability or obligation with respect to the foregoing that will have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Fifth Third. To
the best knowledge of Fifth Third, there are and have been no conditions at
any property owned, operated or otherwise used by, or the subject of a
security interest on behalf of, Fifth Third or any Fifth Third Subsidiary, and
there are no events, conditions, circumstances, practices, plans or legal
requirements that could give rise to obligations or liabilities of Fifth Third
or any Fifth Third Subsidiary under any Environmental Law that, either
individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Fifth Third.



 

-16- 3.17 _Reorganization_. As of the date of this Agreement, Fifth Third is not
aware of any fact or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.



3.18 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Fifth Third for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i)
the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC and at the
time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
and (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the date of mailing to
shareholders and at the time of the meeting of shareholders to be held in
connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, except that
no representation or warranty is made by Fifth Third with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by First National Bankshares for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.



3.19 _Internal Controls_. The records, systems, controls, data
and information of Fifth Third and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored,
maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or
photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the
exclusive ownership and direct control of Fifth Third or its Subsidiaries or
accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for
any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably
be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the system of internal
accounting controls described in the following sentence. As and to the extent
described in the Fifth Third Reports filed with the SEC prior to the date
hereof, Fifth Third and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system
of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Fifth Third (i) has designed
disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information
relating to Fifth Third, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made
known to the management of Fifth Third by others within those entities, and
(ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date
hereof, to Fifth Thirds auditors and the audit committee of Fifth Thirds
Board of Directors (x) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation
of internal controls which could adversely affect in any material respect
Fifth Thirds ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data
and have identified for Fifth Thirds auditors any material weaknesses in
internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Fifth Thirds
internal controls. Fifth Third has initiated its process of compliance with
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and expects to be in full
compliance therewith by the mandated compliance date.



3.20 _Loan Losses_. Since March 31, 2004, none of the bank Subsidiaries of
Fifth Third (the "Fifth Third Bank Subsidiaries") has incurred any unusual or
extraordinary loan losses  



 

-17-  which are material to Fifth Third and the Fifth Third Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis; to the best knowledge of Fifth Third and in light of each
of the Fifth Third Bank Subsidiaries historical loan loss experience and its
managements analysis of the quality and performance of its loan portfolio,
its reserves for loan losses are adequate to absorb potential loan losses
determined on the basis of managements continuing review and evaluation of
the loan portfolio and its judgment as to the impact of economic conditions on
the portfolio.

First National Bankshares. Except for normal examinations conducted by a
Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity in the ordinary course of the

National Bankshares Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period
ended March 31, 2004 (the " _First National Bankshares 10-Q_ "). The financial

where applicable) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
results of operations, changes in shareholders equity, cash flows and
financial position of First National Bankshares and its Subsidiaries for the

or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory
investigations of any nature against First National Bankshares or any of its
Subsidiaries or challenging the validity or propriety of the transactions

4.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns._



(a) FNB has received a ruling, dated December 11, 2003 (the "Ruling"), from
the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), to the effect that the Distribution
(as defined below) qualifies as a tax-free spin-off for federal income tax
purposes under Section 355 of the Code. The officers and directors of First
National Bankshares believe the factual assumptions and representations made
by FNB and First National Bankshares to the IRS in connection with the Ruling
were valid, accurate, true, correct and complete at the time made; and
all facts and  



 

-23-  representations which would have been material to the IRS in issuing the
Ruling were submitted by FNB and First National Bankshares to the IRS.
First National Bankshares and, to the knowledge of First National Bankshares
and its officers and directors, FNB have properly reported to, and filed all
necessary documents with, the IRS to properly treat the Distribution as a tax-
free spin-off for federal income tax purposes under Section 355 of the Code,
and have not filed or recorded any documents inconsistent with such treatment.
For purposes of this Section, "Distribution" means the distribution of the
shares of First National Bankshares Common Stock made on January 1, 2004 by
FNB to its shareholders of record of December 26, 2003.



(b) First National Bankshares had taken no actions to solicit offers to
acquire its Common Stock prior to July 1, 2004 and no discussions or
negotiations regarding the acquisition of First National Bankshares Common
Stock were held prior to the Distribution or prior to July 2, 2004.



(c) Each of First National Bankshares, its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge
of First National Bankshares and its officers and directors, the
Affiliated Group of which First National Bankshares was a member prior to
January 1, 2004 has duly filed all federal, state, foreign and local
information returns and Tax returns required to be filed by it on or prior to
the date of this Agreement (all such returns being accurate and complete in
all material respects) and has duly paid or made provision for the payment of
all Taxes that have been incurred or are due or claimed to be due from it by
federal, state, foreign or local taxing authorities on or prior to the date
of this Agreement other than (i) Taxes or other governmental charges that are
not yet delinquent or are being contested in good faith, have not been finally
determined and have been adequately reserved against under GAAP, or (ii)
information returns, Tax returns or Taxes as to which the failure to file, pay
or make provision for is not reasonably likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on First National Bankshares.
There are no Liens for any Taxes (other than a Lien for current real property
or ad valorem Taxes not yet due and payable) on any the Assets of First
National Bankshares or its Subsidiaries. No claim for Taxes has ever been made
by an authority in a jurisdiction where First National Bankshares or any of
its Subsidiaries does not file a Tax Return that First National Bankshares or
its Subsidiaries may be subject to Taxes by that jurisdiction.



(d) There are no material pending or, to the knowledge of First National
Bankshares and its officers and directors, threatened disputes, claims,
audits or examinations regarding any Taxes of, and there are no assessments
upon, First National Bankshares, or any of its Subsidiaries for which First
National Bankshares does not have adequate reserves under GAAP. To the
knowledge of First National Bankshares and its officers and directors, there
are no material pending or threatened disputes, claims, audits or examinations
regarding any Taxes or assessments upon any Affiliated Group of which First
National Bankshares was a member prior to January 1, 2004, for which FNB does
not have adequate reserves under GAAP.



(e) First National Bankshares, its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of First
National Bankshares and its officers and directors, any Affiliated Group
of which First National Bankshares was a member prior to January 1, 2004,
have withheld and paid all Taxes and the payments thereof to appropriate
authorities, including Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in
connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee or independent
contractor, and Taxes required to be withheld and paid pursuant to Sections
1441 and 1442 of the Code.



 

-24- (f) Neither First National Bankshares nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or
arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between
or among First National Bankshares and its Subsidiaries).



(g) In each case, neither First National Bankshares nor its Subsidiaries has
made any payment, is obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any
contract that could obligate it to make any payments that could be disallowed
as a deduction under Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code; First National
Bankshares has not been a United States real property holding corporation
within the meaning of Code Section 897(c)(2) during the applicable period
specified in Code Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii); and neither First National
Bankshares nor its Subsidiaries has been or will be required to include any

reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on First National Bankshares, all interest rate swaps,

arrangements (collectively, the " _FLB Interest Rate Risk Management
Instruments_ "), whether entered into for the account of First National
Bankshares, one of its Subsidiaries, or for the account of a customer of First
National Bankshares or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the
ordinary course of business and, to First National Bankshares knowledge, (i)
in accordance with prudent banking practice and applicable rules, regulations
and policies of any Regulatory Authority and with counterparties believed
to be financially responsible at the time, (ii) are legal, valid and binding
obligations of First National Bankshares or one of its Subsidiaries
enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting

and (iii) are in full force and effect. First National Bankshares and each of
its Subsidiaries have duly performed in all material respects all of their
material obligations under the FLB Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments

National Bankshares knowledge, there are no material breaches, violations or
defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.



4.17 _Undisclosed Liabilities._ Except for those liabilities that are fully
reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of First

practice since March 31, 2004, neither First National Bankshares nor any of
its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever

reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on First National
Bankshares.

National Bankshares Subsidiary any liability or obligation arising under any
Environmental Laws, including, without limitation, CERCLA, pending or, to the
knowledge of First National Bankshares, threatened against First National
Bankshares or any First National Bankshares Subsidiary, which liability or
obligation will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on First National Bankshares. To the knowledge of First
National Bankshares, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding,
claim, action or governmental



 

-31- investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that will, either
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on First
National Bankshares. Neither First National Bankshares nor any First National
Bankshares Subsidiary is subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree,
letter or memorandum by or with any court, governmental authority, regulatory
agency or third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to the
foregoing that will have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on First National Bankshares. To the best knowledge of First
National Bankshares, there are and have been no conditions at any property
owned, operated or otherwise used by, or the subject of a security interest on
behalf of, First National Bankshares or any First National Bankshares
Subsidiary, and there are no events, conditions, circumstances, practices,
plans or legal requirements that could give rise to obligations or liabilities
of First National Bankshares or any First National Bankshares Subsidiary under
any Environmental Law that, either individually or in the aggregate, would
have a Material Adverse Effect on First National Bankshares.

Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use (in each case, free and clear of any
liens), all Intellectual Property (as defined below) used in or necessary for
the conduct of its business as currently conducted; (b) the use of any

accordance with any applicable license pursuant to which First National
Bankshares or any Subsidiary acquired the right to use any Intellectual
Property; (c) no Person is challenging, infringing on or otherwise violating
any right of First National Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any Intellectual Property owned by and/or licensed to First
National Bankshares or its Subsidiaries; and (d) neither First National
Bankshares nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of any
pending claim with respect to any Intellectual Property used by First
National Bankshares and its Subsidiaries and no Intellectual Property owned
and/or licensed by First National Bankshares or its Subsidiaries is being used
or enforced in a manner that would result in the abandonment, cancellation or
unenforceability of such Intellectual Property. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Intellectual Property" shall mean trademarks, service marks, brand
names, certification marks, trade dress and other indications of origin, the
goodwill associated with the foregoing and registrations in any jurisdiction
of, and applications in any jurisdiction to register, the foregoing, including
any extension, modification or renewal of any such registration or
application; inventions, discoveries and ideas, whether patentable or not, in
any jurisdiction; patents, applications for patents (including, without
limitation, divisions, continuations, continuations in part and

4.21 _Charter Provisions; State Takeover Laws_. The Board of Directors of
First National Bankshares has approved the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement for purposes of Article VII of the First National Bankshares Charter
and Sections 607.0901 and 607.0902 of the FBCA, such that the provisions
of such sections of the Charter and the FBCA or any other "takeover,"
"control share" or "interested stockholder" law or provision will not apply to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. 



 

-32- 4.22 _Reorganization._ As of the date of this Agreement, First National
Bankshares is not aware of any fact or circumstance that would reasonably be
expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.



4.23 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by First National Bankshares for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the
SEC and at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the date of
mailing to shareholders and at the time of the meeting of shareholders to be

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC

National Bankshares with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference therein based on information supplied by Fifth Third for inclusion

4.24 _Loan Losses_. Since March 31, 2004, none of the bank Subsidiaries of
First National Bankshares (the "First National Bankshares Bank Subsidiaries")
has incurred any unusual or extraordinary loan losses which are material to
First National Bankshares and the First National Bankshares Subsidiaries on
a consolidated basis; to the best knowledge of First National Bankshares and
in light of each of the First National Bankshares Bank Subsidiaries
historical loan loss experience and its managements analysis of the quality
and performance of its loan portfolio, its reserves for loan losses are
adequate to absorb potential loan losses determined on the basis of
managements continuing review and evaluation of the loan portfolio and its
judgment as to the impact of economic conditions on the portfolio.



4.25 _Internal Controls_. The records, systems, controls, data and
information of First National Bankshares and its Subsidiaries are recorded,
stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic,
mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are
under the exclusive ownership and direct control of First National Bankshares
or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on
the system of internal accounting controls described in the following
sentence. As and to the extent described in the First National Bankshares
Reports filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, First National
Bankshares and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP. First National Bankshares (i) has designed
disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information
relating to First National Bankshares, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of First National Bankshares by
others within those entities, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the



 

-33- date hereof, to First National Bankshares auditors and the audit committee of
First National Bankshares Board of Directors (x) any significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could
adversely affect in any material respect First National Bankshares ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for
First National Bankshares auditors any material weaknesses in internal
controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in First National Bankshares
internal controls. First National Bankshares has initiated its process of
compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and expects to
be in full compliance therewith by the mandated compliance date.



4.26 _Opinion of First National Bankshares Financial Advisor_. First National
Bankshares has received the opinion of its financial advisor, SunTrust
Robinson Humphrey, a division of SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc., dated the
date of this Agreement, to the effect that the Merger Consideration is fair,
from a financial point of view, to First National Bankshares and the holders
of First National Bankshares Common Stock.



4.27 _Investment Adviser Subsidiaries; Funds; Clients._

or rulings of any Governmental Entity applicable to it or its business and
(ii) has all permits, licenses, exemptions, orders and approvals required for
the operation of its business or ownership of its properties and assets as
presently conducted except, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, where
the failure to be in compliance or failure to have such permits, licenses,
exemptions, orders and approvals, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on First
National Bankshares. There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation
pending or, to the knowledge of First National Bankshares, threatened which
would reasonably be expected to lead to the revocation, amendment, failure to
renew, limitation, suspension or restriction of any such permits, licenses,
exemptions, orders and approvals, except for such revocations, amendments,
failures to renew, limitations, suspensions or restrictions which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on First National Bankshares.



(c) Each First National Bankshares Advisory Entity has been and is in
compliance with each First National Bankshares Advisory Contract to which it
is a party, except where the failure to be so, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on First National Bankshares.



 

-34- (d) The accounts of each First National Bankshares Advisory Client subject to
ERISA have been managed by the applicable First National Bankshares Advisory
Entity in compliance with the applicable requirements of ERISA, except where
the failure to be in compliance, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on First National
Bankshares.



(e) As of the date hereof, except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on First
National Bankshares, neither any of the First National Bankshares Advisory
Entities nor any "affiliated person" (as defined in the Investment Company

of the Investment Advisers Act to serve as an investment advisor or as a
person associated with a registered investment advisor.

Sponsored First National Bankshares Fund Client or any First National
Bankshares Advisory Entity has engaged in, facilitated or been subject to
timing trading or late trading with respect to any registered investment

Entity.



4.28 _Pending Acquisitions_. Neither the consummation of the Southern

cause a violation of any of the representations or warranties contained in
this Agreement or prevent First National Bankshares from performing any of its
obligations hereunder.

by this Agreement, Fifth Third shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, without the prior written consent of First National
Bankshares (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld):



(a) other than for purposes of increasing the number of authorized shares of
Fifth Third Common Stock, amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision of
the Fifth Third Articles or the Code of Regulations of Fifth Third in a manner
that would adversely affect the economic benefits of the merger to the First
National Bankshares shareholders;



(b) knowingly take any action, or knowingly fail to take any action, which
action or failure to act is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code;

 



(c) take any action that would materially impede or delay the ability of the
parties to obtain any necessary approvals of any Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Entity required for the transactions contemplated hereby;



(d) take any action that is intended or is reasonably likely to result in any
of its representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement being
or becoming untrue in any material respect at any time prior to the Effective
Time, or in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article VII_ not
being satisfied or in a violation of any provision of this Agreement, except,
in every case, as may be required by applicable law; or



(e) agree to take, make any commitment to take, or adopt any resolutions of
its board of directors in support of, any of the actions prohibited by this
_Section 5.3_.



 

Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.1 or in this Section 5.3 to the
contrary, Fifth Third may make dispositions and acquisitions and agree to
issue capital stock in connection therewith.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



6.1 _Regulatory Matters._



(a) Fifth Third shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in
which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included. Each of First National
Bankshares and Fifth Third shall use their reasonable best efforts to have the
Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, and First National Bankshares shall thereafter
mail or deliver the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to its shareholders. Fifth
Third shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary
state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and First National Bankshares
shall furnish all information concerning First National Bankshares and the
holders of First National Bankshares Capital Stock as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such action.



(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including, without limitation, the Merger), and to comply with the
terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. First National Bankshares
and Fifth Third shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information
relating to Fifth Third or First National Bankshares, as the case may be, and
any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they
will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein. First
National Bankshares shall also use its best efforts to obtain all information
as may be reasonably requested from FNB.



(c) Each of First National Bankshares and Fifth Third shall, upon
request, furnish to the other all information concerning itself, its

may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Form S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of First National Bankshares, Fifth Third or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(d) Each of First National Bankshares and Fifth Third shall promptly advise
the other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose
consent or  



 

-40-  approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a
reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval (as defined
below) will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be
materially delayed.



 

6.2 _Access to Information._



(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of First National Bankshares and Fifth Third,
for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of the other
and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this
Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to,
afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives of the other party, access, during normal business hours
during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records and, during such period, each of First
National Bankshares and Fifth Third shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or
federal or state banking laws (other than reports or documents which First
National Bankshares or Fifth Third, as the case may be, is not permitted to
disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request.
Neither First National Bankshares nor Fifth Third nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of First National Bankshares or Fifth Thirds, as the case may be,
customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in
possession or control of such information or contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.



(b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be
subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement entered
into between the parties as of July 27, 2004 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").



(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of the other
set forth herein.



6.3 _Shareholder Approval._ First National Bankshares shall call a meeting of
its shareholders to be held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose
of voting upon proposals to adopt this Agreement and approve this Agreement
and the Merger, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
meeting to occur as soon as reasonably practicable. The Board of Directors of
First National Bankshares shall, unless the Board determines such action to be
contrary to its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of First National
Bankshares and has acted in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.14:
(a) recommend that its shareholders adopt this Agreement and approve the
Merger, and (b) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the
shareholders of First National Bankshares the vote in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement and approval of the Merger that is required by the FBCA to
consummate the transactions  



 

-41-  contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless
this Agreement has been terminated, this Agreement shall be submitted to
the shareholders of First National Bankshares at such meeting for the purpose
of obtaining shareholder approval and voting on the approval and adoption of
this Agreement and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve First
National Bankshares of such obligation.



6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger._  Each of First National Bankshares and
Fifth Third shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable
best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper
or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be
imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and,
subject to the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to
cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization,
order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any
other third party that is required to be obtained by Fifth Third or First
National Bankshares or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



6.5 _Tax Treatment._ Each of the Parties undertakes and agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger, and to take no action
which would cause the Merger not, to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax
purposes.



6.6 _Affiliates._ First National Bankshares shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each director, executive officer and other person who is an
"affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of First
National Bankshares to deliver to Fifth Third, as soon as practicable after
the date of this Agreement, and prior to the date of the shareholders meeting
called by First National Bankshares to be held pursuant to _Section 6.3_ , a
written agreement, in the form of _Exhibit 6.6_.



 

6.7 _Stock Quotation or Listing._ Fifth Third shall cause the shares of Fifth
Third Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be qualified for quotation
or listing on the securities market or stock exchange in which the Fifth Third
Common Stock principally trades, subject to official notice of issuance, prior
to the Effective Time.



6.8 _Employee Matters._



(a) From the Effective Time through such later date as Fifth Third
deems reasonably practicable (such date being referred to herein as the "
_Benefits Transition Date_ "), Fifth Third shall provide the employees of
First National Bankshares and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the "
_Covered Employees_ ") with employee benefits and compensation plans,
programs and arrangements that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to
the employee benefits and compensation plans, programs and arrangements
provided by First National Bankshares or its Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, to such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after
the Benefits Transition Date, Fifth Third shall provide the Covered Employees
with employee benefits and compensation plans, programs and arrangements
(other than Fifth Thirds defined benefit pension plan, which has been frozen)
that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to those provided to
similarly situated employees of  



 

-42-  Fifth Third and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything contained herein
to the contrary, those employees of First National Bankshares and
its Subsidiaries (other than temporary and/or co-operative employees) who do
not have an employment, change in control or severance agreement and who are
not employed by Fifth Third or who are terminated or voluntarily resign after
being notified that, as a condition of employment, such employee must work at
a location more than thirty (30) miles from such employees former location of
employment or that such employees salary will be materially decreased, in any
case and in both cases, within ninety (90) days after the Effective Time, and
who sign and deliver a termination and release agreement in a form
substantially similar to one of those attached hereto as _Exhibit 6.7(a)_ ,
shall be entitled to severance pay: (i) in the case of officers of First
National Bankshares and all other exempt employees, equal to two (2) weeks of
pay for each complete year of service (and a prorated amount for any partial
year of service) with a minimum severance pay equal to (4) weeks pay; and
(ii) in the case of all other employees, equal to one (1) week of pay for each
complete year of service (and a prorated amount for any partial year of
service) with a minimum severance pay equal to two (2) weeks of pay. For
purposes of this Section 6.8, "service" shall include service with
subsidiaries of First National Bankshares and service with members of the
Affiliated Group of which First National Bankshares was a member prior to
January 1, 2004. The severance payment referred to above shall replace the
First National Bankshares current severance pay plan, if any, and a new
severance pay plan will be in effect but in no event shall there be any
duplication of severance pay. First National Bankshares shall cooperate with
Fifth Third to comply with, and provide notices regarding, the Workers
Adjustment and Retraining Act or any similar state or local law, including
without limitation, providing notices to employees and government
representatives. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed or
interpreted to limit or modify in any way Fifth Thirds at will employment
policy. In no event shall severance pay or any severance period be taken into
account in determining the amount of any other benefit (including but not
limited to, an individuals benefit under any pension plan). If, by reason of
the controlling plan document, controlling law or otherwise, severance pay or
any severance period is taken into account in determining any other benefit,
the severance pay otherwise payable shall be reduced by the present value of
the additional benefit determined under other benefit plans attributable to
the severance pay or period.



(b) From and after the Effective Time, Fifth Third shall (i) provide
all Covered Employees with service credit for purposes of eligibility,
participation, vesting and levels of benefits (but not for benefit accruals
under any defined benefit pension plan except as otherwise provided in this
_Section 6.8(b)_ ), under any employee benefit or compensation plan, program
or arrangement adopted, maintained or contributed to by Fifth Third or any of
its Subsidiaries in which Covered Employees are eligible to participate, for
all periods of employment with First National Bankshares or any of its
Subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities) prior to the Effective Time, to
the same extent that such service was credited under a comparable plan of
First National Bankshares, (ii) cause any pre-existing conditions or
limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations
under any welfare benefit plans of Fifth Third or any of its Subsidiaries to
be waived with respect to the Covered Employees and their eligible dependents,
to the extent waived under the corresponding plan in which the applicable
Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(iii) give the Covered Employees and their eligible dependents credit for the
plan year in which the Effective Time (or commencement of participation in a
plan of Fifth Third or any of its Subsidiaries) occurs towards applicable
deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for  



 

-43-  expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time (or the date of commencement
of participation in a plan of Fifth Third or any of its Subsidiaries).
For purposes of any cash balance pension plan maintained or contributed to by
Fifth Third or any of its Subsidiaries in which Covered Employees become
eligible to participate following the Effective Time, the Covered Employees
level of benefit accruals under any such plans (for periods of service
following the date on which the Covered Employees commence participation in
such plans) shall be determined based on the Covered Employees credited
service prior to the Effective Time and with the Surviving Corporation
following the Effective Time.



(c) From and after the Effective Time, Fifth Third shall honor all accrued and
vested benefit obligations to and all contractual rights of current and former
employees, directors and consultants of First National Bankshares and
its Subsidiaries under the First National Bankshares Benefit Plans.



(d) Nothing in this Section 6.8 or in this Agreement shall be interpreted as
preventing the Surviving Corporation or Fifth Third from amending, modifying
or terminating any Fifth Third Benefit Plan or other contract, arrangement,
commitment or understanding in accordance with their terms and applicable
law.



(e) If Fifth Third so requests, First National Bankshares or its Subsidiaries
shall develop a plan and timetable for terminating, as of a date not earlier
than one (1) day prior to the Effective Time, any or all of the First
National Bankshares Benefit Plans, and, with the advance written approval of
Fifth Third, shall proceed with the implementation of said termination plan
and timetable; _provided_ no First National Bankshares Benefit Plan shall be
required to be terminated if such termination would adversely affect the
qualification of such First National Bankshares Benefit Plan under the Code.



(f) If Fifth Third so timely requests, First National Bankshares or its
Subsidiaries shall take all actions necessary to file an application
for determination letter with the IRS prior to the Effective Time, for any
First National Bankshares Benefit Plan requested by Fifth Third.



(g) With respect to any First National Bankshares Benefit Plan that provides
for vesting of benefits, there shall be no discretionary acceleration
of vesting without Fifth Thirds consent whether or not such discretionary
acceleration of vesting is provided under the terms of the Benefit Plan;
_provided, however,_ that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, First National Bankshares may in its sole discretion accelerate
the exercisability of any or all options to acquire First National Bankshares
Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the date hereof, with such
acceleration to be effective, if at all, immediately prior to the Effective
Time.



(h) If Fifth Third so requests, First National Bankshares or any of its
Subsidiaries shall take all actions necessary to freeze any or all First
National Bankshares Benefit Plans as of a date not earlier than one day prior
to the Effective Time such that no further contributions (including employee
401(k) contributions) shall be made and no further benefits shall accrue under
such First National Bankshares Benefit Plans after such freeze date.



 

-44- (i) Except as provided otherwise pursuant hereto, First National Bankshares
and any of its Subsidiaries, without the advance written consent of Fifth
Third, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, shall not (i)
adopt any amendments to the First National Bankshares Benefit Plans after the
date of this Agreement; or (ii) make any distributions from the First
National Bankshares Benefit Plans after the date of this Agreement other than
in the ordinary course of operations of such First National Bankshares Benefit
Plans; or (iii) make any contributions to the defined benefit plans
maintained by First National Bankshares or discretionary contributions to any
of the First National Bankshares Benefit Plans after the date of this
Agreement except discretionary contributions in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices to its employees; or (iv) take any
action which would reduce or restrict the availability of surplus (excess of
plan assets over plan liabilities) under any defined benefit plan as defined
in Section 414(j) of the Code.  



(j) First National Bankshares shall provide to Fifth Third from and after the
Effective Time, documentation reasonably satisfactory to Fifth Third
demonstrating that Fifth Third has all power and authority necessary to amend,
transfer, roll-over or satisfy in full any payment or contribution
obligations under, and/or terminate any or all of the First National
Bankshares Benefit Plans, thereby reducing or eliminating future liability.



6.9 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance._



(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including,
without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or
officer of First National Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries, or who is or
was serving at the request of First National Bankshares or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person, including any entity
specified in the First National Bankshares Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that he is or was a director or officer of First National
Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries or any entity specified in the First
National Bankshares Disclosure Schedule or any of their respective
predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective
Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best
efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is understood and agreed
that after the Effective Time, Fifth Third shall indemnify and hold harmless,
as and to the fullest extent permitted by law, each such Indemnified Party
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses
(including reimbursement for reasonable fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of any
undertaking required by applicable law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.



(b) Fifth Third shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the individuals
serving as officers and directors of First National Bankshares, its
Subsidiaries or any entity specified in the First National Bankshares
Disclosure Schedule immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for
a period of three (3) years from the Effective Time by the  



 

-45-  directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by First
National Bankshares ( _provided_ that Fifth Third may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are not less advantageous than such policy) with respect to
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed
by such officers and directors in their capacity as such; provided that in no
event shall Fifth Third be required to expend in any one year an amount in
excess of 150% of the annual premiums currently paid by First National
Bankshares (which current amount is set forth in Section 6.9 of the First
National Bankshares Disclosure Schedule) for such insurance (the "Insurance
Amount").



(c) In the event Fifth Third or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Fifth Third assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_.



(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.



6.10 _Additional Agreements._ In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, any merger between a Subsidiary
of Fifth Third, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of First National
Bankshares, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title
to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any
of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party
to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense
of, Fifth Third.



6.11 _Advice of Changes._ First National Bankshares and Fifth Third shall
each promptly advise the other party of any change or event (i) having or
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it
believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement; _provided further_ that a failure to comply with
this _Section 6.11_ shall not constitute the failure of any condition set
forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse
Effect or material breach would independently result in the failure of a
condition set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied.



6.12 _Dividends._ After the date of this Agreement, each of First National
Bankshares and Fifth Third shall coordinate with the other the declaration of
any dividends in respect of First National Bankshares Common Stock and Fifth
Third Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it
being the intention of the parties hereto that holders of First National
Bankshares Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive
one dividend, for any quarter with respect to their shares of First National
Bankshares Common Stock and any shares of Fifth Third Common Stock any
such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.



 

-46- 6.13 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Fifth Third and First
National Bankshares agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and
retain First National Bankshares Insiders (as defined below) in connection
with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable
that First National Bankshares Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability
under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of First National
Bankshares Common Stock and First National Bankshares Stock Options into
shares of and options for Fifth Third Common Stock in the Merger, and for that
compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this _Section
6.13_. Assuming that First National Bankshares delivers to Fifth Third
the Section 16 Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion, the Board
of Directors of Fifth Third, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof
(as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange
Act), shall adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by First National
Bankshares Insiders of Fifth Third Common Stock in exchange for shares of
First National Bankshares Common Stock, and of options for Fifth Third Common
Stock upon conversion of options for First National Bankshares Common Stock,
in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are
intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the
Exchange Act. The term " _Section 16 Information_ " shall mean information
accurate in all material respects regarding First National Bankshares
Insiders, the number of shares of First National Bankshares Common Stock held
by each such First National Bankshares Insider and expected to be exchanged
for Fifth Third Common Stock in the Merger, and the number and description of
the options for First National Bankshares Common Stock held by each such First
National Bankshares Insider and expected to be converted into options for
Fifth Third Common Stock in connection with the Merger; _provided_ that the
requirement for a description of any First National Bankshares Stock Options
shall be deemed to be satisfied if copies of all First National Bankshares
Stock Plans, and agreements evidencing grants thereunder, under which such
First National Bankshares Stock Options have been granted, have been made
available to Fifth Third. The term " _First National Bankshares Insiders_ "
shall mean those officers and directors of First National Bankshares who are
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and
who are listed in the Section 16 Information.



6.14 _Acquisition Proposals._



(a) First National Bankshares agrees that it, its Subsidiaries and each
of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant or other representative retained by First National Bankshares or
any of its Subsidiaries) will (i) cease immediately and terminate any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) will
not release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. From and
after the date of this Agreement and until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement or the Effective Time, except in compliance with this Section
6.14, First National Bankshares will not, and will not permit its directors,
officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other  



 

-47-  representatives, agents or Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate, or encourage any Acquisition Proposals; (ii) engage in
discussions with third parties, or negotiations concerning, or provide any
non-public information to any person or entity in connection with, any
Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) agree to, approve, recommend or otherwise
endorse or support any Acquisition Proposal, except that, if First National
Bankshares receives a communication that it believes, after consultation with
its outside counsel, may upon clarification constitute a Superior Proposal (as
defined below), First National Bankshares may communicate with the person
making such communication to the limited extent necessary to obtain the
necessary clarification.



(b) As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any tender or
exchange offer involving First National Bankshares or any of its
Subsidiaries, any proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business
combination involving First National Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than the Southern Community Merger and the First Bradenton Merger), any
proposal or offer to acquire in any manner an interest in excess of fifteen
percent (15%) of the outstanding equity securities, or a substantial portion
of the business or assets of, First National Bankshares or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than assets or inventory in the ordinary course of
business or assets held for sale), any proposal or offer with respect to any
recapitalization or restructuring with respect to First National Bankshares or
any of its Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer with respect to any other
transaction similar to any of the foregoing with respect to First National
Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries other than pursuant to the Merger.



(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.14(a) above, if a corporation,
limited liability company, limited liability partnership, partnership, person
or other entity or group (a "Third Party") after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the First National Bankshares shareholders meeting required by
Section 6.3 submits to First National Bankshares Board of Directors
an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal, and First National
Bankshares Board of Directors reasonably determines in good faith, after
receipt of advice from outside legal counsel that the failure to engage in
discussions with the Third Party concerning such Acquisition Proposal would
likely cause First National Bankshares Board of Directors to breach its
fiduciary duties to First National Bankshares and its shareholders, then, in
such case, (i) First National Bankshares may (A) furnish information about
its business to the Third Party under protection of an appropriate
confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and
disclosure of all non-public written or oral information furnished to such
Third Party, provided that First National Bankshares must contemporaneously
furnish to Fifth Third all such non-public information furnished to the Third
Party which has not been previously disclosed to Fifth Third and
(B) negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations with such Third
Party; and (ii) if First National Bankshares Board of Directors determines
that such an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, First National
Bankshares Board of Directors may (subject to the provisions of this Section
6.14) (A) withdraw or adversely modify its approval or recommendation of the
Merger and recommend such Superior Proposal or (B) terminate this Agreement,
in each case, at any time after the second business day following delivery of
written notice to Fifth Third (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") advising Fifth
Third that First National Bankshares Board of Directors has received a
Superior Proposal, identifying the Third Party and specifying the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal. First National Bankshares may
take either of the foregoing actions pursuant to the preceding sentence if,
and only if, an Acquisition Proposal that was a Superior Proposal continues
to be a Superior Proposal  



 

-48-  in light of any improved proposal submitted by Fifth Third, considered in
good faith by First National Bankshares and with the advice of a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, prior to the expiration of the
two business day period specified in the preceding sentence. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide, written Acquisition
Proposal for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, and
otherwise on terms which First National Bankshares Board of Directors
determines are more favorable to First National Bankshares shareholders from
a financial point of view than the Merger (or other revised proposal
submitted by Fifth Third as contemplated above), after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and a financial adviser of nationally recognized
reputation and that the Third Party is reasonably likely to consummate the
Superior Proposal on the terms proposed, that the Third Partys offer is fully
financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed, and is reasonably
likely to receive all required governmental approvals on a timely
basis. Further, for purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," the
term Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
Section 6.14(b) except that the reference to "15% or more" in the definition

National Bankshares from taking, and disclosing to its shareholders, a
position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9(e) under the Exchange Act.

arrangement, without the prior written consent of Fifth Third, or (b) make any
payments or fund any obligations under any First National Bankshares Benefit
Plan, employment agreement, change in control agreement or similar arrangement
that First National Bankshares deems are mandatory or required thereunder
without prior written notice to Fifth Third; _provided, however,_ that First
National Bankshares shall continue to be able to make salary and other
compensation payments in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice to its employees.

take such action as is necessary so that any officer, director or employee of
Southern Community or First Bradenton, upon the consummation of the Southern
Community Merger or the First Bradenton Merger respectively, receives any type

otherwise in connection with those mergers, respectively, shall not be
entitled to receive any such payment upon the consummation of the Merger.

approval of their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after
approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the
shareholders of First National Bankshares; _provided_ , _however_ , that after

the consideration to be delivered to the holders of First National Bankshares
Common Stock hereunder, other than as contemplated by this Agreement. Any
agreement on the part of a party  



 

-57- hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

Form of Affiliate Letter Addressed to Fifth Third



Fifth Third Bancorp

38 Fountain Square Plaza

Fifth Third, Ohio 45263



Ladies and Gentlemen:



I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of First National Bankshares of Florida, Inc. ("First National
Bankshares"), as the term "affiliate" is (i) defined for purposes of
paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the "Rules
and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission")
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and/or (ii) used in
and for purposes of Accounting Series Releases Nos. 130 and 135, as amended,
of the Commission. I have been further advised that pursuant to the terms of
the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 1, 2004 (the
"Merger Agreement"), by and between Fifth Third and First National
Bankshares, First National Bankshares shall be merged with and into Fifth
Third (the "Merger") and each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of First National Bankshares ("First National Bankshares Common
Stock") shall be converted into the right to receive _ _ shares of
common stock, without par value, of Fifth Third ("Fifth Third Common Stock").
All terms used in this letter but not defined herein shall have the meanings
ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.



 

(1) I represent, warrant and covenant to Fifth Third that in the event I
receive any Fifth Third Common Stock as a result of the Merger:



(a) I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of Fifth Third
Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.



(b) I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement.



(c) I have been advised that the issuance of Fifth Third Common Stock to me
pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act
on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised
that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the
stockholders of First National Bankshares I may be deemed to have been an
affiliate of First National Bankshares and the distribution by me of Fifth
Third Common Stock has not been registered under the Act, I may not sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of Fifth Third Common Stock issued to me in the
Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been
registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is
made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145
promulgated by the Commission under the Act, (iii) in the opinion of counsel
reasonably acceptable to Fifth Third, such sale, transfer or other disposition
is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act or (iv) such transfer or
other disposition is a _bona_ _fide_ gift or charitable donation so long as
the recipient of the gift or donation enters into an agreement with Fifth
Third substantially identical to this Letter Agreement.



  

-62- (d) I understand that Fifth Third is under no obligation to register the sale,
transfer or other disposition of Fifth Third Common Stock by me or on my
behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make
compliance with an exemption from such registration available.



(e) I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Fifth
Thirds transfer agents with respect to Fifth Third Common Stock and that
there will be placed on the certificates for Fifth Third Common Stock issued
to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: 



"The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in a
transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933
applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in compliance with the
requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a registration statement under said
act or an exemption from such registration."



(f) I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Fifth Third Common
Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with
the provisions of Rule 145, Fifth Third reserves the right to put the
following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:



"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under
the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such
shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act
of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view
to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the
meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or
otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."



It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in Paragraphs (1)(e)
and (1)(f) above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates
without such legend (i) if the undersigned shall have delivered to Fifth
Third a copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, an opinion of
counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Fifth Third, or other
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Fifth Third, to the effect that such
legend is not required for purposes of the Act, or (ii) on or after the one-
year anniversary of the Effective Time.



(2) I recognize and agree that Paragraph (1) also applies to (i) my spouse,
(ii) any relative of mine occupying my home or any relative of my
spouse occupying my home, (iii) any trust or estate in which I, my spouse or
any such relative owns at least 10% beneficial interest or of which any of us
serves as trustee, executor or in any similar capacity and (iv) any corporate
or other organization in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at
least 10% of any class of equity securities or of the equity interest.



(3) Fifth Third and I agree that the periods of time and the scope applicable
to the covenants of Paragraph 3 are reasonable and necessary to protect
the legitimate business interests of Fifth Third without unduly limiting my
ability to obtain employment or otherwise earn a living at the



 

-63- same general level of economic benefit as anticipated by the Merger Agreement.
However, if such period or scope should be adjudged unreasonable in any
judicial or other dispute resolution proceeding, then the period of time or
scope shall be reduced by the extent deemed unreasonable, so that these
covenants may be enforced during such period and for such scope as
are adjudged to be reasonable.



(4) Without intending to limit the remedies available to Fifth Third, I agree
that damages at law will be an insufficient remedy to Fifth Third in the event
that I violate Paragraph 3 hereof and that Fifth Third may apply for and is
entitled to emergency and/or injunctive relief in any court of competent
jurisdiction to restrain the breach or threatened breach of, or otherwise to
specifically enforce any of the covenants in Paragraph 3 of this Letter
Agreement, in each case without proof of actual damages.



(5) Fifth Third and I agree that any action to enforce this Letter
Agreement may be brought in a state or federal court located in Hamilton
County, Ohio. Fifth Third and I agree that such courts shall have jurisdiction
and venue with respect to any such action.



It is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate and be
of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms. It is also understood and agreed that this Letter
Agreement, other than with respect to Paragraphs 3, 4, 5, and 6, which shall
survive and remain in full force and effect, shall terminate and be of no
further force and effect upon delivery by the undersigned to Fifth Third of a
copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, an opinion of counsel in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Fifth Third, or other evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Fifth Third, to the effect that a transfer of the
undersigneds shares of Fifth Third Common Stock will not violate the Act or
any of the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder.



Execution of this letter should not be construed as an admission on my
part that I am an "affiliate" of First National Bankshares as described in
the first paragraph of this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to
object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this
letter.

[DATE]



SEVERANCE AGREEMENT AND GENERAL RELEASE OF ALL CLAIMS



In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged,  _ _ ("you") and First
National Bankshares of Florida, Inc., and Fifth Third Bancorp including their
officers, directors and subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively "Fifth
Third") agree as follows:



   A. | Your job assignments are eliminated as of _ _.
If you remain employed through that date and comply with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, you will receive a severance payment as outlined
in the enclosed First National Bankshares of Florida, Inc. Severance Pay Plan.
This payment will not be treated as compensation under any retirement plan or
employee benefit plan. 
---|--- 



   B. | In exchange for the above severance and to preserve the interests
of Fifth Third in its clients and customers, you agree as follows: 
---|--- 


1\. (a) During the Period (as defined below), you will not directly
or indirectly, whether for your own account or for the account of any other
person, or other organization; provide Financial Services (as defined below)
to any Client (as defined below); make any statement or take any actions that
may interfere with Fifth Thirds or any affiliates business relationships
with any Client; contact either directly or indirectly any Client or otherwise
induce or attempt to induce any Client to enter into any business relationship
with any person or firm other than Fifth Third or an affiliate relating to
Financial Services; attempt to entice away from Fifth Third any person who is,
or was at any time during the period you were employed by Fifth Third or
during the Period, employed by or associated with Fifth Third as an
executive, officer, employee, manager, salesperson, consultant, independent
contractor, representative or other agent, or take any actions that may
interfere with Fifth Thirds property rights in lists of Clients or otherwise
reduce the value of such lists to Fifth Third.



     | (b) | "Period" will be the period beginning on the final date of
employment and ending one year from that date. 
---|---|--- 


     | (c) | "Financial Services" means banking, trust, securities,
investment consulting, asset management, mortgage, and all other services
which are provided by Fifth Third at any time during the Period. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | "Client" means all persons or entities who are or were
clients of Fifth Third at the date of termination of employment or at any time 
---|---|--- 


 

-65-  during the two year period prior to the date of termination of your
employment and any potential clients who, to your knowledge, have been
identified and contacted by a representative of Fifth Third; provided that
Client shall not include any member of your immediate family.



2\. You agree that, if you should breach any of the covenants of Paragraph 1
above, the Period will be extended by the length of time during which you
are in breach of any such covenant.



3\. You and Fifth Third agree that the periods of time and the scope
applicable to the agreements in Paragraphs 1 and 2 are reasonable and
necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of Fifth Third without
unduly limiting your ability to obtain employment or otherwise earn a living
at the same general level of economic benefit as anticipated by this
Agreement. However, if such period or scope should be adjudged unreasonable in
any type of proceeding, then the period of time or scope will be reduced by
the extent deemed unreasonable, so that these covenants may be enforced
during such period and for such scope as are determined to be reasonable.



4\. The commitments you have made in this Agreement will survive the
termination of your employment with Fifth Third. Without intending to limit
the remedies available to Fifth Third, you agree that damages at law will not
be sufficient to provide Fifth Third with the value of the commitments you
have made in the event that you violate any of the terms of this letter and
that Fifth Third may apply for and is entitled to emergency and/or injunctive
relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the breach or
threatened breach of, or otherwise specifically enforce any of the covenants
in this Agreement, in each case without Fifth Third having to prove it has
actually been damaged by your actions.



   C. | You and Fifth Third agree that any action to enforce this
Agreement may be brought in a state or federal court located in Hamilton
County, Ohio. You and Fifth Third hereby agree that such courts shall have
jurisdiction and venue with respect to any such action. 
---|--- 



   D. | As additional consideration, you, on your behalf and on behalf of
your heirs, executors, successors, and assigns hereby release Fifth Third, as
well as all of their officers, directors, executives, managers and employees,
from any and all debts, claims, demands, rights, actions, causes of action,
suits or damages, whatsoever and of every kind of nature, whether known or
unknown (collectively the "Claims"), against Fifth Third and the others
released herein, which relate to or arose from your employment with or
separation from Fifth Third as contemplated herein except to the extent such
Claims cannot under applicable law be released. You also covenant not to sue
or file or cause to be filed any complaint with any federal, state or local
agency or in any court against Fifth Third, or the others released herein,
regarding any matter related to your employment with or separation from
employment with Fifth Third, including but not limited to any 
---|--- 



 

-66-  Claims which you may have under Federal Law or any similar state law, with
respect to such separation, except to the extent such Claims cannot
under applicable law be released. You specifically acknowledge that this
Agreement releases any claims you may have under the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act. 

---|--- 



   E. | You also agree to fully cooperate with Fifth Third and its
customers during this transition. If you fail to cooperate to Fifth Thirds
satisfaction as determined by Fifth Third you will be deemed to have
voluntarily resigned your positions, and the wavier and releases in favor of
Fifth Third in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 
---|--- 



   F. | You will not be eligible for reemployment with Fifth Third Bancorp
or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. You will not make any disparaging
remarks concerning Fifth Third or any of its employees to anyone. 
---|--- 



   G. | You agree that apart from your discussions with your personal
counsel and your immediate family, whom you will ask not to divulge the terms
of this Agreement, you will not disclose, publicize or discuss either the
terms of this Agreement or your employment with and termination from Fifth
Third with anyone within or outside of Fifth Third unless required by subpoena
or any other legal compulsion, and you will give immediate notice to Fifth
Third of the receipt of any subpoena or other legal document which might call
upon you to disclose either any of the contents of this Agreement or your
employment with and termination from Fifth Third. 
---|--- 


   H. | You represent and warrant that you have returned Fifth Third the
original and any copies of all keys, identification cards, charge cards,
equipment, papers, reports, memoranda or other items of Fifth Third property.
You acknowledge that Fifth Third has returned to you all items of your
personal property. 
---|--- 



   I. | You recognize and agree that nothing in this Agreement constitutes
an admission of liability or wrongdoing by you or by Fifth Third or any of the
others released herein.  
---|--- 



   J. | This Agreement will be governed by Ohio law. 
---|--- 



   K. | In October 1990, the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act ("Act")
was enacted. The Act provides, among other things, that notice be given to you
in writing and in a manner calculated to be understood by the average
individual affected by this termination. As provided in the Act, you have a
right to consider this Agreement for a period of forty-five days. If you
choose to accept it, you must sign it and return it to your Human Resource
Manager on or before _ _. You will then have seven days
after such acceptance to change your mind and revoke the Agreement. If you
accept the Agreement and do not revoke it, payment will be made to you as
provided in the Agreement. If you decide not to accept the Agreement or accept
the Agreement but revoke acceptance within seven days, nothing will be paid
to you under the Agreement and your employment will end on _
_. You are advised to consult with an attorney before acting on this
Agreement.
