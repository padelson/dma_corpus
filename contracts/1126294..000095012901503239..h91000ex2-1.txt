                          ----------------------------

            AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of September 26, 2001 (this
"AGREEMENT"), by and among Reliant Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("PARENT"), Reliant Energy Power Generation Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB"), and Orion
Power Holdings, Inc. a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY").

            WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company have approved this Agreement, and deem it advisable, and in the
best interests of their respective stockholders to consummate the merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company on the terms and conditions set forth
herein (the "MERGER") whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock,

wholly owned subsidiaries) and other than the Appraisal Shares, shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount per share in cash as set forth in
this Agreement;

            WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery hereof, the
persons and entities listed on Schedule A hereto, which in the aggregate own a
total of 62,562,903 shares of Company Common Stock, are each entering into a
Stockholder Agreement (the "STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS") with Parent providing for,
among other things, the voting of such shares in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby; and

            WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective

Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto hereby
agree as follows:

                                   THE MERGER

            Section 2.01. THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION") and shall succeed to and
assume all the rights and obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with the DGCL.

            Section 2.02. CLOSING. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the third business day after the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions to be satisfied
or waived at the Closing), at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, 51
West 52nd Street, New York, New York 10019, or at such other time, date or place
agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company; provided, however, that the
Closing shall be delayed if and only for so long as necessary if a banking
moratorium, act of terrorism or war (whether or not declared) affecting United
States banking or financial markets generally prevents Parent (together with its
subsidiaries) from borrowing funds which (when added to the funds otherwise
available to it) would be sufficient to pay the cash consideration hereunder at
the time the Closing would otherwise occur. The date on which the Closing occurs
is referred to in this Agreement as the "CLOSING DATE".

            Section 2.03. EFFECTIVE TIME. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practicable on or, if
permissible, prior to the Closing Date, a certificate of merger or other
appropriate documents (in any such case, the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") shall be
duly prepared, executed and acknowledged by the parties in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL and filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at
such subsequent time or date as Parent and the Company shall agree in writing
and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The time at which the Merger becomes
effective is referred to in this Agreement as the "EFFECTIVE TIME".

            Section 2.04. EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

            Section 2.05. CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS. (a) At the
Effective Time, subject to the requirements of the provisions of Section 5.12,
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended
in its entirety to read as the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

            (b) At the Effective Time, subject to the requirements of the
provisions of Section 5.12, the By-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

            Section 2.06. DIRECTORS. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

            Section 2.07. OFFICERS. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until
the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

                                      -4-

            Section 2.08. EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

            (a) CAPITAL STOCK OF MERGER SUB. Each share of common stock of
     Merger Sub, par value $1.00 per share, issued and outstanding immediately
     prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully
     paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

            (b) CANCELLATION OF TREASURY STOCK AND PARENT-OWNED STOCK. Each
     share of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the
     Company (or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned
     subsidiaries) immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) shall
     automatically be cancelled and retired, (ii) shall cease to exist and (iii)
     no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

            (c) CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. Each share of Company Common
     Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
     than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.08(b) and the
     Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive in cash,
     without interest, an amount equal to $26.80 (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION").
     At the Effective Time all such shares shall no longer be outstanding and
     shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
     of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
     any such shares (a "CERTIFICATE") shall cease to have any rights with
     respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

            (d) APPRAISAL RIGHTS. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
     the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is
     entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant
     to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of
     the DGCL ("SECTION 262") (the "APPRAISAL SHARES") shall not be converted
     into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
     2.08(c), but instead such holder shall be entitled to such rights (but only
     such rights) as are granted by Section 262. At the Effective Time, all
     Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
     cancelled and shall cease to exist, and except as otherwise provided by
     applicable law, each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any
     rights with respect thereto other than such rights as are granted by
     Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail
     to validly perfect or shall otherwise waive, withdraw or lose the right to
     appraisal under Section 262 or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
     determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
     Section 262, then the rights of such holder under Section 262 shall cease
     and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the
     Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger
     Consideration as provided in Section 2.08(c). The Company shall give prompt
     notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company
     Common Stock, and Parent shall have the opportunity to participate in all
     negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
     Effective Time, the Company shall not,

                                      -5-

<PAGE>   10

     without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
     to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of
     the foregoing.

            Section 2.09. SURRENDER AND PAYMENT. (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, for the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options and
Warrants, Parent shall designate, or shall cause to be designated (pursuant to
an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Company), a bank or trust company acceptable to the Company in its reasonable
discretion to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon
surrender of Certificates and for the payment of cash in respect of Company
Options and Warrants in accordance with this Article II (the "PAYING AGENT"),
from time to time after the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or cause Merger Sub to deposit, with the Paying Agent (i) cash in
amounts sufficient for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.08(c) upon surrender of Certificates, and (ii) cash payable pursuant
to Sections 2.10 and 2.11 in respect of Company Options and Warrants.

            (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURE. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective  Time but in no event later than the first  business day following the
Closing  Date,  the  Paying  Agent  shall  mail to each  holder  of  record of a
Certificate  (and appropriate  documentation  for holders of Company Options and
Warrants) (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected,  and risk of loss and title to the Certificates  held by such
person shall pass, only upon proper  delivery of the  Certificates to the Paying
Agent and shall be in customary  form and have such other  provisions  as Parent
and the  Company  may  reasonably  specify)  and  (ii)  instructions  for use in
effecting  the  surrender  of  the  Certificates  in  exchange  for  the  Merger
Consideration.  Upon surrender of a Certificate  for  cancellation to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed  by Parent,  together
with such letter of transmittal,  duly completed and validly executed,  and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of
cash into which the shares formerly  represented by such Certificate  shall have
been converted  pursuant to Section 2.08(c),  and the Certificate so surrendered
shall  forthwith be cancelled.  Parent's  agreement  with the Paying Agent shall
provide that,  upon surrender of a Certificate  for  cancellation  to the Paying
Agent or to such  other  agent or  agents as may be  appointed  by  Parent,  any
holders of more than five  thousand  shares of Company  Common Stock  (including
shares  issuable  upon the  exercise of Warrants and Company  Options)  shall be
entitled to receive payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares
of Company  Common Stock and an amount of cash  determined  pursuant to Sections
2.10 and 2.11 with respect to any Warrants  and Company  Options,  respectively,
held by them by wire  transfer  of  immediately  available  funds as promptly as
practicable  after the  Effective  Time,  but in no event  later  than the first
business day following the Closing  Date, to the  account(s)  designated by such
stockholder.  In the event of a transfer of  ownership  of Company  Common Stock
that is not registered in the stock  transfer  books of the Company,  the proper
amount  of cash may be paid in  exchange  therefor  to a person  other  than the
person in whose  name the  Certificate  so  surrendered  is  registered  if such
Certificate  shall be  properly  endorsed  or  otherwise  be in proper  form for
transfer and the person  requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other
taxes  required by reason of the payment to a person  other than the  registered
holder of such  Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such
tax has  been  paid or is not  applicable.  No  interest  shall be paid or shall
accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.  Upon the delivery
to the  Paying  Agent of the  appropriate  documentation  in  respect

                                      -6-
<PAGE>   11

of Company Options and Warrants, the holder of such Company Option or Warrant
will be entitled to receive an amount of cash determined pursuant to Sections
2.10 and 2.11.

            (c) STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS. At the close of business on the day on
which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

            (d) NO LIABILITY. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. All funds held by the Paying Agent for payment to the holders of
unsurrendered Certificates and unclaimed at the end of one year after the
Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, after which time any holder of
unsurrendered Certificates shall look as a general creditor only to Parent for
payment of such funds to which such holder may be due, subject to applicable
law.

            (e) LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration.

            (f) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock, Company Options or Warrants such amounts as Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "CODE"), or
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
the shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options or Warrants in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent.

            Section 2.10. OPTIONS. At the Effective Time, each then outstanding
and unexercised option or right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
granted under the Company Option Plan or otherwise granted by the Company (each,
a "COMPANY OPTION"), whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall be
converted into an obligation of the Company to pay, and a right of the holder
thereof to receive thereupon in full satisfaction of such Company Option, cash
in an amount in respect thereof equal to the product of (a) the excess, if any,
of the

                                      -7-
<PAGE>   12

Merger Consideration over the exercise price thereof and (b) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option.

            Section 2.11. WARRANTS. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
warrant to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (the "WARRANTS") shall be
converted into an obligation of Parent to pay, and a right of the holder thereof
to receive thereupon in full satisfaction of such Warrant, cash in an amount in
respect thereof equal to the product of (a) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price of such Warrant and (b) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Warrant.

other agreement designed to protect against fluctuations in interest rates,
pledge agreement, security agreement, deed of trust, bond, debenture, note,
mortgage, indenture, guarantee, lease or other contract, commitment, obligation,
undertaking, concession, franchise or license (each, including all amendments
thereto, a "CONTRACT") to which Parent, Merger Sub or any subsidiary of Parent
is a party or by which Parent, Merger Sub or any subsidiary of Parent or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, other than, in
the case of (ii) and (iii) above, such violations, conflicts, breaches,
defaults, terminations, accelerations, offers, prepayments or creations of
liens, security interests or encumbrances that would not reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or prevent or materially impede or delay the consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

            (c) Except for (i) the filings by Parent and Merger Sub required by
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR

approvals referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) collectively referred to as
the "PARENT REQUIRED STATUTORY APPROVALS"), no declaration, filing or
registration with, or notice to, or authorization, consent or approval of, any
Governmental Authority is necessary for the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub
of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than such declarations, filings,
registrations, notices, authorizations, consents or approvals which, if not made
or obtained, as the case may be, individually and in the aggregate, would not
impair in any material respect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or prevent or materially impede or delay
the consummation of the Merger.

stockholders of the Company, will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and shall not, at the
time of the Company Meeting, omit to state any material fact necessary to
correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the
solicitation of proxies for the Company Meeting which shall have become false or
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub make no
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by or on
behalf of the Company which is contained in the Proxy Statement or any amendment
or supplement thereto.

            Section 3.06. OWNERSHIP OF CAPITAL STOCK. As of the date hereof,

            Section 5.02. CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS. Each of the Company and Parent
agrees that, from and after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, and
except as may be agreed in writing by the other or as may be expressly permitted
pursuant to this Agreement, it shall not, and shall not permit any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates, to make any acquisition, develop or construct any
electric generation facility, enter into any term, tolling or power purchase
agreement or otherwise obtain control over any electric generation facility, or
take any action with any regulatory authority, or agree, in writing or
otherwise, to do any of the foregoing, which could reasonably be expected to
materially delay the consummation of the Merger or result in the failure to
satisfy any condition to consummation of the Merger.

            Section 5.03. NO SOLICITATION. (a) After the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time or earlier termination of this Agreement, the Company and
each of its subsidiaries shall not, and the Company shall direct and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries' officers,
directors and employees and any attorney, accountant, investment banker,
financial advisor or other agent retained by it or any of its subsidiaries, not
to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or negotiate or provide nonpublic
or confidential information to facilitate, any proposal or offer with respect to
any merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar transaction
involving the Company, or any purchase (pursuant to a new issuance, tender
offer, takeover bid or otherwise) of, or offer to purchase, 20% or more of the
voting securities of the Company, or any assets or businesses that generate 20%
or more of the Company's consolidated annual net revenues or net income for the
one-year period ended June 30, 2001 or constitute 20% or more of its
stockholders' equity at that date, in a single transaction or a series of
related transactions, or any combination of the foregoing (any such transaction
being referred to herein as an "ACQUISITION TRANSACTION").

            (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) above or any
other provision of this Agreement, prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company may, in response to an unsolicited bona fide
written offer or proposal with respect to a potential or proposed Acquisition
Transaction (an "ACQUISITION PROPOSAL") from a corporation, partnership, person
or other entity or group (a "POTENTIAL ACQUIROR") which the Company's Board of
Directors determines, after consultation with its independent financial advisor
and legal counsel, could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
furnish confidential or nonpublic information to, and engage in discussions and
negotiate with, such Potential Acquiror; PROVIDED that no information shall be
furnished to any Potential Acquiror unless such Potential Acquiror shall have
entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company, containing terms and
conditions, with respect to confidentiality, of substantially the same effect as
those of the Confidentiality Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
"SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means an Acquisition Proposal which the Company's Board of
Directors determines, in good faith and after consultation with its independent
financial advisor and legal counsel, is more favorable to the holders of the
Company Common Stock than this Agreement and the Merger, taking into account,
among other things, (i) the likelihood and timing of consummation, (ii) any
amendments to or modifications of this Agreement that Parent has offered or
proposed at the time of determination, and (iii) such other factors deemed
relevant by the Company's Board of Directors.

            (c) The Company shall as soon as is reasonably practicable notify
Parent orally and in writing after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal. Such
notice to Parent shall

                                      -25-
<PAGE>   30

indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the Potential Acquiror and the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, to the extent known.
The Company shall notify Parent as soon as is reasonably practicable of any
material changes or modifications in the material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal and provide to Parent, as soon as reasonably practicable, copies of the
form of merger agreement or acquisition agreement, as the case may be, in
connection with any such Acquisition Proposal, which the Company has negotiated
with a Potential Acquiror.

            (d) At any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may withdraw or modify the
recommendation by the Board of Directors of the Company of this Agreement, or
the Merger, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and its independent financial advisor)
that its failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations.

            (e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 or any other provision of
this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the
Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company's stockholders a position
with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rule
14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making such
disclosure to the Company's stockholders as, in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation with outside counsel), is
required under applicable law.

            (f) The Company agrees that, to the extent it has not already done
so, it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions or negotiations by it or its representatives with any person other
than Parent conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.


            Section 5.04. ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY. Except for
competitively sensitive information as to which access, use and treatment is
subject to applicable law, the Company and its subsidiaries shall afford to
Parent and Merger Sub and their respective accountants, counsel, financial
advisors, lenders, potential lenders and other representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours upon reasonable notice throughout the period prior
to the Effective Time to their respective properties, books, contracts,
commitments and records and, during such period, shall furnish promptly such
information concerning its businesses, properties and personnel as Parent or
Merger Sub shall reasonably request; provided, however, such investigation shall
not unreasonably disrupt the Company's operations and shall not be deemed to
permit Parent or Merger Sub to conduct any on site environmental investigations
or examinations. All nonpublic information provided to, or obtained by, Parent
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall be "Evaluation
Material" for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement dated August 17, 2001
between Parent and the Company (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), the terms of
which shall continue in force until the Effective Time; provided that Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company may disclose such information as may be necessary in
connection with seeking the Parent Required Statutory Approvals, the Company
Required Statutory Approvals and the Company Stockholder Approval.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide any
information which it reasonably believes it may not provide to Parent by reason
of applicable law, rules or

                                      -26-
<PAGE>   31

regulations, which constitutes information protected by attorney/client
privilege, or which the Company or any subsidiary is required to keep
confidential by reason of contract, agreement or understanding with third
parties if the Company has used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure. Except to the
extent prohibited by applicable law, the Company will consult with Parent from
time to time prior to the Effective Time regarding engineering and technical
aspects relating to the design and construction of its Astoria Repowering
Project and other material construction and development projects.

            Section 5.05. MERGER SUB. Parent will take all action necessary (a)
to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
and (b) to ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not
conduct any business or make any investments other than as specifically
contemplated by this Agreement, or incur or guarantee any indebtedness.

            Section 5.06. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. (a) Parent agrees that the Company
will honor, and from and after the Effective Time, Parent and its affiliates
shall honor, all Company Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time, subject to any amendment or termination
thereof that may be permitted by such terms and will honor the benefits
covenants with respect to the Company's acquisitions referenced in Schedule
5.06(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. For a period of not less than two
years following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to the current and former employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries (other than Company Employees subject to a collective bargaining
agreement) (the "COMPANY EMPLOYEES") compensation and employee benefits that are
substantially equivalent, when taken together, to those provided to the Company
Employees in the aggregate immediately before the Effective Time. Subject to any
existing employment agreements, nothing in this Section 5.06 affects, or is
intended to affect, the at will employment status of the Company Employees at
any time after the Effective Time.

            (b) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Parent and
its affiliates providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective
Time (the "NEW PLANS"), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her
years of service with the Company and its affiliates before the Effective Time,
to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Plans. In addition,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage
under a comparable Company Plan in which such Company Employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "OLD
PLANS"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall
cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents,
and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his
or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date such employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-

                                      -27-
<PAGE>   32

pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

            (c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" within the
meaning of the Company Plans, as applicable, will occur on the Effective Time.

            (d) Parent hereby acknowledges that the executives listed on
Schedule 5.06(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall have "Good Reason"
under their employment agreements as of the Effective Time. Accordingly, from
and after the Effective Time, such executives shall be eligible to terminate
employment and receive the severance benefits which are to be paid for a "Good
Reason" termination occurring on or immediately following the Effective Time.

            (e) For so long after the Effective Time as the Company or any of
its subsidiaries maintains a 401(k) plan (all such plans, the "COMPANY 401(K)
PLAN"), and Parent maintains a 401(k) plan with a loan feature for similarly
situated employees, Parent shall cause the Company 401(k) Plan to retain the
loan feature of such plan. Effective as of the Effective Time, the Company will
fully vest the account balances of each participant in the Company 401(k) Plan
who is a Company Employee.

            (f) If the Effective Time occurs in the 2001 calendar year, the
Company shall pay each Company Employee employed as of the Effective Time and
then participating in any Company Plan that is an annual bonus plan listed in
Schedule 5.06(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (a "BONUS PLAN") the greater
of (i) such Company Employee's deemed bonus entitlement under such plans for the
entire calendar year 2001, as if the Bonus Plan and the Company Employee's
participation in such Bonus Plan had continued through the end of 2001, based on
comparing the Company's annual performance goals for the year to the Company's
projected performance for the entire 2001 calendar year, determined by utilizing
actual performance for the period beginning on January 1, 2001 and ending as of
the end of the month immediately preceding the month in which the Effective Time
occurs (or as of the end of the month in which the Effective Time occurs, if the
Effective Time coincides with the end of the month) and assuming the Company's
performance for the remainder of the year equals the Company's monthly
performance goals for the balance of the year and (ii) such Company Employee's
target bonus award under such plans, in each case multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall equal the number of days in the calendar year in which
the Effective Time occurs through the Effective Time and the denominator of
which is 365 (the "FRACTION"). If the Effective Time occurs in the 2002 calendar
year, the Company shall pay each Company Employee employed as of the Effective
Time and then participating in a Bonus Plan a bonus equal to such Company
Employee's target bonus award multiplied by the Fraction. If the Company has not
established a Bonus Plan for 2002 as of the Effective Time, the payment in this
Section 5.06(f) described in the preceding sentence shall be made to those
participants in the Bonus Plan for 2001 and all new employees who, based on
their job title, would have been eligible to participate in the Bonus Plan for
2001 and who remain in the Company's employ as of the Effective Time and shall
be based on target bonus percentage equal to the actual (or deemed, with respect
to new employees) percentage applicable for the Bonus Plan for 2001. The Company
shall be permitted to establish a Bonus Plan for 2002, which shall be
substantially the same as the Bonus Plan for 2001. The remainder of the bonus
award (based upon the Bonus

                                      -28-

<PAGE>   33

Plan for 2001 or 2002, as the case may be), if any, for each Company Employee in
respect of the portion of the year which elapses after the Effective Time occurs
shall be paid during January of the following calendar year, to those Company
Employees who are employed with Parent or any of its affiliates at the end of
the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs or who have been terminated
prior to such date by the Company or Parent without cause, or terminated due to
death or disability. Company performance in respect of calculations made under
the Bonus Plans and the Company Plans, to the extent applicable, for the
calendar years 2001 and 2002 shall be calculated without taking into account any
expenses or costs associated with or arising as a result of transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any non-recurring charges that would not
reasonably be expected to have been incurred had the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement not occurred.

            (g) The Company may provide up to $20 million as a retention pool
(the "RETENTION POOL") for the purpose of retaining the services of key Company
Employees. The Chief Executive Officer of the Company shall determine, subject
to approval by the Board of Directors of the Company, the size of the Retention
Pool, the Company Employees eligible to receive retention awards from the
Retention Pool (each a "RETENTION BONUS") and any criteria for payment of the
Retention Bonus, and shall determine the final allocation of payments from the
Retention Pool. Any Retention Bonus shall be intended to retain the services of
the recipient through, and shall be payable (if such recipient still remains
employed by the Company at such time) on, the Closing Date in the case of the
Company's current Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal
Officer, Senior Vice President (Operations) and Senior Vice President
(Development) or the date that is 90 days after the Closing Date (or such
earlier date as may be determined by Parent) in the case of other Company
Employees, provided, that participants who are constructively terminated or
terminated without cause or as a result of death or disability prior to the date
through which services were to be provided shall, upon such termination, receive
any Retention Bonus which would be payable to them following the date through
which services were to be provided.

            Section 5.07. MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS AND PROXY STATEMENT. The
Company shall take all action necessary, in accordance with applicable law and
its certificate of incorporation and by-laws, to convene as promptly as
reasonably practicable the Company Meeting. In connection with the Company
Meeting and the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company will (i) as
promptly as practicable prepare and file with the SEC, use its best efforts to
have cleared by the SEC, and thereafter mail to its stockholders as promptly as
practicable the Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto and
all other proxy materials for such meeting, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts
(including postponing or adjourning the Company Meeting to solicit additional
proxies) to obtain the necessary approvals by its stockholders of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) otherwise comply with all
legal requirements applicable to such meeting. The Company shall provide Parent
and its legal counsel with sufficient opportunity to review the form and
substance of the Proxy Statement (including any amendments or supplements
thereto) prior to filing such with the SEC. The Company shall provide to Parent
copies of any comments received from the SEC in connection therewith. Subject to
Section 5.03, the Proxy Statement shall contain the unqualified recommendation
of the Board of Directors of the Company that its stockholders vote in favor of
the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with the terms

                                      -29-
<PAGE>   34

hereof, the Company shall submit this Agreement to its stockholders for a vote
at the Company Meeting, whether or not the Board of Directors of the Company
withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation regarding the foregoing
matters.

            Section 5.08. SECTION 16 MATTERS. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required and
permitted to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to shares of Company Common Stock) by each individual
who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

            Section 5.09. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. The initial press release by
Parent and the Company announcing the signing of this Agreement shall be a joint
press release in the form attached as Exhibit B and shall be released by Parent
and the Company. Except to the extent the immediately preceding sentence applies
and other than with respect to any public announcement made by the Company in
connection with Section 5.03, Parent and the Company will consult with each
other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and make
reasonable comment upon, any press release or making any public statement with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and, except
as may be required by applicable law or any listing agreement with the NYSE,
will not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation; provided, however, that each of Parent and the Company may
issue a press release or make any public statement in response to specific
questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry
conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such
statements are not inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures
or public statements made by Parent or the Company, as the case may be.

            Section 5.10. EXPENSES AND FEES. (a) All costs and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such expenses, except that those expenses
incurred in connection with printing and filing the Proxy Statement shall be
shared equally by Parent and the Company. The Company has provided to Parent in
Schedule 5.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule a good faith estimate of the
fees and expenses to be paid by the Company and its subsidiaries to all
professional advisors in connection with the Merger.

            (b) The Company agrees to pay to Parent (without duplication) the
fees set forth below under the following circumstances:

                (i) if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to clause
          (e) of  Section  7.01,  the  Company  shall  pay  Parent  a fee of $90
          million,  such  fee to be  payable  by wire  transfer  of  immediately
          available  funds to an account  specified  in writing by Parent at the
          time of such termination;

                (ii) (x) if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to clause
          (f) of Section 7.01, or (y) if Parent or the Company  terminates  this
          Agreement pursuant to clause (b)(iii) of Section 7.01, and in the case
          of either of  subclauses  (x) or (y)

                                      -30-
<PAGE>   35

          hereof (A) Parent was not at the time of termination in material
          breach of its representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
          contained in this Agreement, and (B) after the date hereof but prior
          to the time of the Company Meeting a proposal by a third party
          relating to an Acquisition Transaction had been publicly proposed or
          publicly announced and not withdrawn, the Company shall pay Parent a
          fee of $45 million within three business days following termination by
          wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified
          in writing by Parent. In addition, if a fee shall be payable pursuant
          to the first sentence of this clause (b)(ii) and on or prior to the
          nine-month anniversary of a termination of this Agreement which gives
          rise to the obligation to pay a fee pursuant to such first sentence,
          the Company enters into an agreement with respect to an Acquisition
          Transaction or the Company or its Board of Directors recommends a
          third-party tender- or exchange-offer which would result in the
          offeror (other than The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its affiliates)
          beneficially owning in excess of 50% of the outstanding shares of the
          Company Common Stock (an "ACQUISITION TENDER"), the Company shall pay
          Parent an additional fee of $45 million upon consummation of an
          Acquisition Transaction or Acquisition Tender, by wire transfer of
          immediately available funds to an account specified in writing by
          Parent, such additional fee to be payable at the time such an
          Acquisition Transaction or Acquisition Tender is consummated. For the
          purposes of Section 5.10 (b)(ii), in the definition of Acquisition
          Transaction, all references to 20% shall instead be deemed to be 50%.

            Section 5.11. AGREEMENT TO COOPERATE. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and applicable law, each of Parent and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action
and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including to obtain all necessary
or appropriate waivers, consents or approvals of third parties required in order
to preserve material contractual relationships of Parent and the Company and
their respective subsidiaries, all necessary or appropriate waivers, consents
and approvals to effect all necessary registrations, filings and submissions and
to lift any injunction or other legal bar to consummation of the Merger (and, in
such case, to proceed with the consummation of the Merger as expeditiously as
possible), including through all possible appeals.

            (b) In addition to and without limitation of the foregoing, each of
Parent and the Company undertakes and agrees to (i) file (and Parent agrees to
cause any person or entity that may be deemed to be the ultimate parent entity
or otherwise to control Parent to file, if such filing is required by law) as
soon as practicable, and in any event prior to ten business days after the date
hereof, a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the United States
Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice (and shall file as soon as practicable any form or report
required by any other Governmental Authority relating to antitrust, competition,
trade or energy regulation matters) and (ii) take any act, make any undertaking
or receive any clearance or approval required by any Governmental Authority or
applicable law. Each of Parent and the Company shall (and Parent shall cause any
such parent entity to) (i) respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries
or requests received from any Governmental Authority for additional information
or documentation, and (ii) not

                                      -31-
<PAGE>   36

extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Authority not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except with the prior consent of the other parties hereto (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
antitrust, competition, or trade or energy regulation law (including the Federal
Power Act, as amended, and the FERC's regulations thereunder; any applicable New
York laws, and the NYPSC regulations thereunder; the HSR Act; and, if
applicable, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, and the
regulations promulgated thereunder) that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Effective Time to occur
as soon as reasonably possible, but in any event to insure that the Effective
Time occurs no later than the Termination Date. Each party shall (i) promptly
notify the other party of any written communication to that party or its
affiliates from any Governmental Authority and, subject to applicable law,
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed written communication
to any of the foregoing; (ii) not agree to participate, or to permit its
affiliates to participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry
concerning this Agreement or the Merger unless it consults with the other party
in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives
the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat; and (iii)
furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings, and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between them
and their affiliates and their respective representatives on the one hand, and
any Governmental Authority or members of their respective staffs on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger.

            (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent, the Company or
any of their respective subsidiaries to dispose of any of its assets or to limit
its freedom of action with respect to any of its assets or businesses, whether
prior to or after the Effective Time, or to commit or agree to any of the
foregoing, in order to obtain any consents, approvals, permits or authorizations
or to remove any impediments to the Merger relating to the HSR Act or any other
law, regulation or order or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction or other order in any suit or proceeding relating thereto,
other than dispositions, limitations, commitments, or agreements that in each
such case may be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby and that in each such case do not and would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on the business, assets or financial condition of the Company and
its subsidiaries together with Parent and its subsidiaries taken as a whole as
constituted after the Effective Time.

            Section 5.12. DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INDEMNIFICATION. (a) The
indemnification provisions of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and
By-laws as in effect at the Effective Time shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at
the Effective Time were directors, officers or employees of the Company;
provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action
pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until
the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and
honor, guaranty and stand surety for, and shall cause the Company to

                                      -32-
<PAGE>   37

honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants
contained in this Section 5.12, without limit as to time.

            (b) Each of Parent and the Company and, from and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation, shall, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of
each of the foregoing) each present and former director, officer or employee of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries and each person who served as a director,
officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (each,
together with such person's heirs, executors or administrators, an "INDEMNIFIED
PARTY" and collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against any costs or
expenses (including advancing attorneys' fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by law), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an
"ACTION"), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or after the
Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such persons
serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service
was at the request or for the benefit of the Company) or the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or arising out of or pertaining to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event of any such
Action, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the
Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Action.

            (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries
(provided that Parent may substitute therefor third-party policies of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous to the Indemnified Parties, and which coverages and amounts shall
be no less than the coverages and amounts provided at that time for Parent's
directors and officers) with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time; provided, that after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of
the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof (the amount
of which premium is set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule), but in such
case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount.

            (d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.12.

            (e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party
may have under the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company, any
other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this
Section 5.12 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are
intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties.

<PAGE>   38

            (f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.12.

            Section 5.13. SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE. The Surviving Corporation
shall execute a supplemental indenture, effective at the Effective Time, by
which there shall be made the adjustments in the conversion provisions of the
indenture relating to the Convertible Notes (the "CONVERTIBLE NOTES INDENTURE")
that are required to be made as a result of the Merger in order to provide for
each of the Convertible Notes to be convertible from and after the Merger into
the amount of cash receivable upon the consummation of the Merger by a holder of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock into which such Convertible Note
might have been converted immediately prior to the Merger, in the manner and to
the extent required by the Convertible Notes Indenture.

            Section 5.14. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each party hereby agrees to
perform any further acts and to execute and deliver any documents which may be
reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this Agreement.

            Section 5.15. CONTROL OF OTHER PARTY'S BUSINESS. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct Parent's operations prior to the Effective Time. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right
to control or direct the Company's operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior
to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over their respective operations.

     prohibiting the consummation of the Merger (each party agreeing to use its
     best efforts, including appeals to higher courts, to have any judgment,
     injunction, order or decree lifted); and

            (c) (i) any waiting period applicable to consummation of the Merger
     under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated, and (ii) all
     registrations, filings,

     waivers  relating  to the  Merger  to be  obtained  from  the  Governmental
     Authorities listed in Schedule 3.02(c) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule or
     Schedule 4.04(c) of the Company  Disclosure  Schedule and indicated therein

case as of such earlier date), and (ii) those not so qualified shall be true and
correct as of the Closing Date, except to the extent such representations and
warranties expressly relate to an earlier date (in which case as of such earlier
date), except for failures of the representations and warranties referred to in
this clause (ii) to be true and correct as do not and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
(provided that this Material Adverse Effect exception shall not apply to (x) the
representations and warranties contained in the first sentence of Section 4.20,
and (y) prior to the distribution of the shares of common stock of Parent to the
stockholders of Reliant Energy, Incorporated, the representations and warranties
contained in the second sentence of Section 4.20); and

            (c) Parent shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of the

provided in Sections 6.02 (a) and (b) have been satisfied.

the Closing Date, except to the extent such representations and warranties
expressly relate to an earlier date (in which case as of such earlier date),
except for failures of the representations and warranties referred to in this
clause (ii) to be true and correct as do not and would not

                                      -35-
<PAGE>   40

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on Parent and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; and

            (c) the Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf
of Parent by an executive officer of Parent indicating that the conditions

                                   ARTICLE VII

                                   TERMINATION

            Section 7.01. TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective
Time (notwithstanding any approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company):

            (a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

            (b) by either Parent or the Company:

                (i) if the Merger has not been consummated on or before

          September 30, 2002 (such date, as it may be extended under clause (A)
          of this paragraph, the "TERMINATION DATE"); provided, however, that
          (A) each of the Company and Parent shall have the option, in its sole
          discretion, to extend the Termination Date for an additional period of
          time not to exceed 90 days if the condition set forth in Section 6.01
          (a) has been satisfied, all other conditions to consummation of the
          Merger are satisfied or capable of then being satisfied and the sole
          reason that the Merger has not been consummated by such date is that
          the condition set forth in Section 6.01(b) or (c) has not been
          satisfied due to the failure to obtain the necessary consents and
          approvals under applicable laws or a judgment, injunction, order or
          decree of a court or other Governmental Authority of competent
          jurisdiction shall be in effect and Parent or the Company are still
          attempting to obtain such necessary consents and approvals under
          applicable laws, or are contesting (x) the refusal of the relevant
          Governmental Authority to give such consents or approvals or (y) the
          entry of any such judgment, injunction, order or decree, in court or
          through other applicable proceedings; (B) the right to terminate this
          Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(b)(i) shall not be available
          to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement has been
          the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to be
          consummated by the Termination Date (it being agreed that the date of
          September 30, 2002 (or, if applicable, the 90-day period referred to
          in clause (A) hereof) shall be extended by one day for each day that
          the closing is delayed pursuant to the proviso to the first sentence
          of Section 2.02);

                (ii) if any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States
          or other  United  States  Governmental  Authority  shall have issued a
          final  order,  decree  or  ruling  or taken  any  other  final  action
          restraining,  enjoining or otherwise  prohibiting  the Merger and such
          order,  decree,  ruling or other  action is or shall

                                      -36-
<PAGE>   41

          have become final and nonappealable, PROVIDED that the party seeking
          to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(b)(ii) shall
          have used reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of and to
          remove such order, decree, ruling or final action; or

                (iii) this Agreement shall not have been approved and adopted by
          the  Company's  stockholders  by reason of the  failure  to obtain the
          required vote at a duly held meeting of  stockholders  (including  any
          adjournment thereof);

            (c) by Parent if there has been a material breach by the Company of
     any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
     Agreement which (x) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in
     Section 6.02 (a) or (b) and (y) cannot be cured prior to the Termination
     Date;

            (d) by the Company if there has been a material breach by Parent or
     Merger Sub of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
     in this Agreement which (x) would result in a failure of a condition set
     forth in Section 6.03 (a) or (b) and (y) cannot be cured prior to the
     Termination Date;

            (e) by the Company, after giving Parent three days prior (but
     revocable) written notice of its receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, in
     order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition
     Transaction which is a Superior Proposal; provided that the Company has
     complied with its obligations under Section 5.03 in all material respects;
     and

            (f) by Parent, if the Company's Board of Directors shall have
     withdrawn or adversely amended in any material respect its approval or
     recommendation of the Merger or this Agreement to the Company's
     stockholders, it being understood that neither (x) disclosure of any
     competing proposal that is not being recommended by the Board of Directors
     of the Company nor (y) disclosure of any facts or circumstances, together
     with a statement that the Board of Directors of the Company continues to
     recommend approval and adoption of the Merger and this Agreement, shall be
     considered to be a withdrawal or adverse amendment in any material respect
     of such approval or recommendation.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01 (other
than pursuant to Section 7.01(a)) shall give notice of such termination to the
other party.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

            Section 8.01. EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of
this Agreement by either Parent or the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.01, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void, and there shall be no liability or further obligation on the part
of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective officers or directors
(except as set forth in Sections 5.04, 5.10, 8.01 and 8.05, all of which shall
survive the termination). Nothing in this Section 8.01 shall relieve any party
from liability for

                                      -37-
<PAGE>   42

any willful or material breach of any covenant or agreement of such party
contained in this Agreement.

            Section 8.02. NON-SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. No
representations or warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. This Section 8.02
shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties which by its terms
contemplates performance after such time.

Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. In this Agreement, unless a
contrary intention appears, (i) the words "herein," "hereof" and "hereunder" and
other words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular Article, Section or other subdivision, (ii) "knowledge" shall mean
actual knowledge of the executive officers of the Company or Parent, as the case

provisions of this Agreement in the Chancery Court or other Courts of the State
of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are

YORK APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS EXECUTED AND TO BE PERFORMED WHOLLY WITHIN SUCH
STATE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES OF SUCH STATE.

            Section 8.06. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, and by facsimile, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.

            Section 8.07. AMENDMENTS; EXTENSIONS. (a) This Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective
Boards of Directors, at any time before or after the Company Stockholder
Approval has been obtained; PROVIDED that, after the Company Stockholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by law
requires further approval by stockholders of the Company without the further
approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

            (b) At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to the
extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein; provided that after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no waiver that by
law requires further approval by stockholders of the Company without the further
approval of such stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure or delay of any party to
this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements,

promise, understanding, condition or warranty not set forth herein has been made
or relied upon by any party hereto. Neither this Agreement nor any

former and present officers, directors, employees and agents, and Article II
hereof.

            Section 8.09. SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all other provisions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party.

            Section 8.10. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not to be performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that
the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof in
addition to any other remedies at law or in equity.

            Section 8.11. NO ADMISSION. Nothing herein shall be deemed an
admission by the Company, in any action or proceeding by or on behalf of a third
