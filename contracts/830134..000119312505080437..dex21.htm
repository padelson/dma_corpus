existence under the laws of the State of Delaware, and the separate corporate
existence of Acquisition shall cease.



Section 2.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Kaye Scholer LLP, 425 Park Avenue, New York, New
York at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, as soon as practicable, but in no
event later than the second (2nd) Business Day after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (excluding conditions that,
by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but the Closing shall
be subject to the contemporaneous satisfaction or waiver of those conditions),
or at such other place or at such other date as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is hereinafter
referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ".



Section 2.3 _Effective Time_. At the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause
the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, or such later time at which the Merger shall become effective as is
specified in the Certificate of Merger and as is agreed to by Parent and the
Company, being the " _Effective Time_ ") and shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger.



Section 2.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the
Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises

all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Acquisition shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.



 

10 Section 2.5 _Certificate of Incorporation_.



(a) Subject to Section 6.9, at the Effective Time, the certificate
of incorporation of the Company (the " _Existing Charter_ ") shall be amended
so as to read in its entirety in the form attached as _Exhibit A_ hereto, and
as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms
and applicable Law.



(b) Subject to Section 6.9, at the Effective Time, the by-laws of the Company
(the " _Existing Bylaws_ ") shall be amended so as to read in their entirety
in the form to be provided by Parent to the Company no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to Closing, and reasonably acceptable to the Company, and,
as so amended, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with their terms, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Law.



Section 2.6 _Officers and Directors_. The individuals identified by Parent in
a written notice to be delivered to the Company no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to Closing shall be the initial officers and directors

case until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.



ARTICLE III

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS 



Section 3.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:



(a) Each share of common stock of Acquisition issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.



(b) Each share of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company, or owned
by Parent, Acquisition or owned by any of their respective Subsidiaries, in
each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled without
any conversion thereof and no consideration shall be paid with respect
thereto.



(c) Each share of Common Stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than any Dissenting Shares and shares of Common
Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(b), shall be converted into the
right to receive $20.50 in cash, without interest (the " _Per Share Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, and subject to Section 3.4
hereof, each such share of Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired, and each holder of record of a
certificate representing any such shares (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, other than the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration, in accordance with Section 3.5.



 

11 (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of the Companys capital stock on the records of the Company.



Section 3.2 _Treatment of Options and Other Equity Awards_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all action necessary such that:



(a) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding Option shall be canceled and
each holder of an Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
other than the right, if such Option is an Identified Option, to receive the
Option Consideration, if any, in accordance with this Section 3.2(a). Each
holder of an Identified Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including any Identified Option that would terminate or be forfeited by
its terms as a result of the Merger), whether or not then exercisable, shall
be entitled to receive in cash an amount (the " _Option Consideration_ ")
equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Common Stock for such
Identified Option and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock then subject
to such Identified Option. Payment of the Option Consideration shall be made
by the Surviving Corporation, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable after consummation of the Merger and
receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the surrendered option agreement or
other document representing such Identified Option, or if the holder is unable
to deliver such agreement or document, a customary affidavit and agreement of
indemnification, in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and a written
instrument, reasonably satisfactory to Parent, duly executed by the holder of
such Identified Option setting forth (x) a representation by such holder that
he or she is the owner of all options represented by such Identified Option
and (y) a confirmation of, and consent to, the cancellation of all of the
options represented by such Identified Option. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, as of
the Effective Time, any Option which is not an Identified Option will be
cancelled without further action by the Company and without consideration to
the holder thereof. All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.2(a) shall
be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid without
interest.



(b) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding Award shall be canceled and
each holder of an Award shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, other than the right, if such Award is an Identified Award, to
receive the Stock Award Consideration, if any, in accordance with this Section
3.2(b). Each holder of an Identified Award outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (including any Identified Award that would terminate or be
forfeited by its terms as a result of the Merger), whether or not subject to
any restrictions, limitations or conditions, shall be entitled to receive in
cash an amount (the " _Stock Award Consideration_ ") equal to the product of
(i) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the unpaid
purchase price per share of Common Stock, if any, for such Identified Award
and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock then subject to such Identified
Award. Payment of the Stock Award Consideration shall be made by the Surviving
Corporation, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as soon as
practicable after consummation of the Merger and receipt by the Surviving
Corporation of the surrendered restricted stock or deferred stock agreement or
other document representing such Identified Award or if the holder is unable
to deliver such agreement or document, a customary affidavit and agreement
of indemnification, in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and a written
instrument, reasonably  



 

12  satisfactory to Parent, duly executed by the holder of such Identified Award
setting forth (x) a representation by such holder that he or she is the owner
of such Identified Award and (y) a confirmation of, and consent to, the
cancellation of such Identified Award. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, as of
the Effective Time, any Award which is not an Identified Award will be
cancelled without further action by the Company and without consideration to
the holder thereof. All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.2(b) shall
be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid without
interest.



(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take or cause to be taken
all actions necessary to effectuate the foregoing treatment in this Section
3.2 to the extent such treatment is not expressly provided for by the terms of
the applicable Company Equity Plans and related agreements and/or other
documents relating to the grant by the Company of outstanding Options and
Awards.



(d) As of the Effective Time, all Company Securities other than the
outstanding Common Stock, Identified Options and Identified Awards shall be
cancelled and extinguished without consideration to any Person and shall no
longer represent the rights purported to be represented thereby, and no holder
of any such Company Securities shall have any further rights in respect
thereof.



Section 3.3 _Adjustment of Per Share Merger Consideration_. In the event
that, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, any
stock split, combination, reclassification or stock dividend with respect to
the Common Stock, any change or conversion of the Common Stock into other
securities or any other dividend or distribution with respect to the Common
Stock should occur, appropriate and proportionate adjustments shall be made to
the Per Share Merger Consideration, and thereafter all references to the Per
Share Merger Consideration shall be deemed to be to Per Share Merger
Consideration as so adjusted.



Section 3.4 _Dissenting Shares_.



(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and which are held by Stockholders who have not voted in
favor of or consented to the Merger and who have properly demanded and
perfected their rights to be paid the fair value of such shares of Common
Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_
") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to only such rights
as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
any such Stockholder shall fail to perfect or shall effectively waive,
withdraw or lose such Stockholders rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such
Stockholders shares of Common Stock in respect of which the Stockholder would
otherwise be entitled to receive fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective Time, into
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration without any interest
thereon.



(b) The Company shall provide Parent with prompt notice of any
notice received by the Company of intent to demand the fair value of any
shares of Common Stock,  



 

13  withdrawals of such notices and any other instruments served pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company. The parties will
cooperate in good faith with respect to, and endeavor to mutually agree upon
the approach to be taken with respect to, all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to the exercise of dissenters rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent
or as otherwise required by applicable Law, make any payment with respect to
any such exercise of dissenters rights or offer to settle or settle any such
rights.



Section 3.5 _Payment and Exchange of Certificates_.

 



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as a paying and
exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent will provide to, or cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide to, and shall deposit in trust with, the Paying Agent,
the aggregate cash consideration to which the Stockholders become entitled
under Section 3.1(c). Until used for that purpose, and unless otherwise
directed by Parent, such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent in
liquid debt securities rated AA or higher by at least two nationally-
recognized rating agencies; _provided_ , that no such investment or loss
thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the Stockholders pursuant to this
Article III (it being understood that Parent promptly will cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide to, and deposit in trust with, the Paying Agent, any
additional amounts necessary as a result of any such losses thereon). Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall promptly be
paid to Parent upon its request.



(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
send to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record
of Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing
such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (including (A) a provision
confirming that delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates
to the Paying Agent, and (B) a form of certification by the Person executing
such letter of transmittal to the effect that such Person is not "foreign" for
purposes of Sections 897 and 1445 of the Code), and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange for the Per Share
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent,
together with a duly executed letter of transmittal (A) the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per Share
Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Common Stock represented
thereby and (B) the Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section

3.5(b), subject to Section 3.4, each Certificate shall be deemed, from and
after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
payment of any portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and to deliver an agreement of indemnification, in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, against any claims that may be made against the
Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate.



(c) If any Per Share Merger Consideration is to be paid to any Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor, it shall be a  



 

14  condition to such exchange that such surrendered Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and such Person
either (i) shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required
as a result of the distribution of such cash payment to such Person, or (ii)
shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Parent or the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Common Stock such
amounts as Parent or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent or the Paying Agent. All amounts in respect of Taxes received or
withheld by Parent shall be disposed of by Parent in accordance with the Code
or such state, local or foreign Tax Law, as applicable.



(d) The Per Share Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates
in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.5 shall be deemed to have been
delivered (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates.



(e) At any time which is more than 180 days after the Effective Time, Parent
shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to the
Surviving Corporation any funds which had been deposited with the Paying
Agent and have not been disbursed in accordance with this Section 3.5 and
after the funds have been delivered to Parent, Persons entitled to payment in
accordance with this Section 3.5 shall be entitled to look solely to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration upon
surrender of the Certificates held by them, without any interest thereon. Any
Per Share Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any government entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto. Neither the Surviving Corporation, Parent nor the Paying Agent will
be liable to any Person entitled to payment under this Article III for any
consideration which is delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.



ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY



Except as set forth in the disclosure letter (with specific reference to
the Section or Subsection of this Agreement to which the information stated
in such disclosure relates; _provided_ that any fact or condition disclosed in
any Section or Subsection of such disclosure letter in such a way as to make
its relevance to another Section or Subsection of this Agreement reasonably
apparent shall be deemed to be an exception to such Section or Subsection of
this Agreement) delivered by the Company to Parent concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "); the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Acquisition that:



 

15 Section 4.1 _Corporate Existence and Power_. Each of the Acquired Companies
(a) is a corporation or other entity duly organized and is validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and
(b) is duly licensed or qualified to do business as a foreign corporation or
other entity and is in good standing under the Laws of each other state of
the United States or the Laws of any foreign jurisdiction, if applicable, in
which the character of the properties owned, licensed or leased by it or in
which the transaction of its business as now conducted makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified or to be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Acquired Companies has
all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate, license and
lease its properties and carry on its business as now conducted, except where
the failure to have such power and authority would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to
Parent true and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
or other governing instruments of each of the Acquired Companies as currently
in effect (the " _Company Organizational Documents_ "). To the Knowledge of
the Company and subject to the unavailability of certain records and minutes
concerning the negotiations of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and the Existing Proposal, the corporate records and
minute books of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries made available to
Parent prior to the date hereof are complete and correct in all material
respects and reflect all material actions taken and material
authorizations made at meetings of the Acquired Companies boards of
directors (or equivalent governing bodies) or any committees thereof and at
any stockholders (or equivalent) meetings thereof.



Section 4.2 _Authorization, Enforceability; Company Board Recommendation_.

and deliver this Agreement and all agreements and documents executed by it in
connection herewith and subject to the adoption of this Agreement by the

transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, have been duly and
validly authorized by the Board of Directors, and no other corporate action on
the part of the Company is necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, other
than the Required Stockholder Approval and all actions expressly contemplated
herein for which action of the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) is
necessary. This Agreement has been, and all agreements and documents, executed
by the Company in connection herewith have been or will be, duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company, and (assuming this Agreement and all
agreements and documents executed by the Company in connection herewith
constitute a valid and binding obligation of the other parties thereto)
constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that such enforceability may
be subject to, and limited by, applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, receivership and similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and general equitable
principles.



(b) On or prior to the date hereof, the Board of Directors has, based on the
unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, adopted resolutions
(i) determining that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and the Stockholders,
(ii) declaring advisable and approving this Agreement and the Merger in
accordance with the DGCL and (iii) resolving to recommend to the Stockholders
 



 

16  (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ") that they vote in favor of the
adoption of the Agreement in accordance with the DGCL. No "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover Law
(including Section 203 of the DGCL) (each, a " _Takeover Statute_ ") or any
anti-takeover provision in the Existing Charter or Existing Bylaws is, or at
the Effective Time will be, applicable to the Company, the Common Stock, the
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company has not entered
into, and its Board of Directors has not adopted or authorized the adoption
of, a shareholder rights plan or similar agreement. No Person is a "Related
Person" under Article XII of the Existing Charter in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No other anti-takeover Laws apply
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.



Section 4.3 _Capitalization of the Company_.



(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists solely of 50,000,000
shares of Common Stock and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.001 per share (" _Preferred Stock_ "). As of the close of business

shares of Common Stock outstanding on the Capitalization Date are, and all
shares of Common Stock which may be issued subsequent to such date will be,

secrets, know-how, software, databases and other intellectual property rights
the loss of which would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect (the " _Company Intellectual Property Rights_ "). The
"Brookstone" name constitutes Company Intellectual Property Rights owned
exclusively by the Company in the jurisdictions in which it is
duly registered and in the classes indicated on such registrations. A true
and complete list of all issued patents, registered marks, registered domain
names owned by the Company, along with all applications for the issues or
registration of further patents, marks and domain names owned by the Company,
is set forth in Section 4.19(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. All Company
Intellectual Property Rights are either owned by one or more of the Acquired
Companies free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted
Encumbrances or are used pursuant to a license agreement. To the Knowledge of
the Company, each such license agreement is valid and enforceable and in full
force and effect and no Acquired Company is in default under any such license
agreement in any material respect. To the Knowledge of the Company, no Company
Intellectual Property Right that is owned by an Acquired Company infringes or
otherwise conflicts with any material right of any Person and there is no
pending or threatened litigation, adversarial proceeding, administrative
action or other challenge or claim relating to any Company Intellectual
Property Right. To the Knowledge of Company, there is currently no material
infringement by any person of any Company Intellectual Property Right owned
by an Acquired Company. The Company Intellectual Property Rights owned, used
or possessed by the Acquired Companies together with the other intellectual
property owned or licensed by the Acquired Companies are sufficient and
adequate to conduct their business as currently conducted.



(b) The Acquired Companies have taken reasonable steps to protect, maintain
and safeguard the Company Intellectual Property Rights, including any
Company Intellectual Property Rights for which improper or unauthorized
disclosure would impair its value or validity, and have executed and required
nondisclosure agreements when reasonably appropriate.



(c) To the Knowledge of the Company, and except for such matters as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the
conduct of the business of the Acquired Companies as now conducted does not
infringe any valid patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks,
copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual property of other Persons.
The execution of this agreement by the Company and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, will not result in the
loss or impairment of any Company Intellectual Property Rights.



 

31 (d) The Company has privacy policies (each, a " _Privacy Policy_ ") regarding
the collection and use of information from customers and website visitors ("
_Customer Information_ "), correct and complete copies of which have been made
available to Parent. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
collected or used any Customer Information in material violation of any
applicable Laws or in material violation of any applicable Privacy Policy. The

_occurrence_ " basis and (v) no written notice of cancellation or termination
has been received by any Acquired Company with respect to any such policy.
None of the Company or its Subsidiaries has any material obligation for
retrospective premiums for any period prior to the Effective Time which would
reasonably be expected. All such policies are in full force and effect and
will remain in full force and effect up to and including the Effective Time,
unless replaced with comparable insurance policies having comparable terms and
conditions. No insurer has put the Company on notice that coverage has or may
be denied with respect to any pending claim submitted to insurer by the
Company. __

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(b) In connection with the Merger and the Stockholders Meeting, the Company

prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement and Schedule 13E-3, the Company
shall consult with Parent with respect to such filings, shall afford Parent

Parents comments thereto. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the

provisions of Section 6.5(d), the Company Board Recommendation shall be
included in the Proxy Statement.



(c) The Company represents and warrants that the Proxy Statement and the
Schedule 13E-3 will, in the case of the Schedule 13E-3 as of the time of its
filing with the SEC (and the time of the filing of any amendment thereto),
and, in the case of the Proxy Statement, as of the time the Proxy Statement
(or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to the
Stockholders and as of the time of the Stockholders Meeting, not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not

Section 6.4 _Stockholders Meeting_. Subject to the provisions of Section
6.5(d) and Section 8.1, (a) the Company shall, acting through its Board of
Directors, take all action necessary under all applicable Laws to call, give
notice of and hold a meeting of the Stockholders to vote on a proposal to
adopt this Agreement (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") and shall submit such
proposal to such holders at the Stockholders Meeting, (b) the Company (after
consultation with Parent) shall set a record date for Persons entitled to
notice of, and to vote at, the Stockholders Meeting and (c) the Stockholders
Meeting shall be held (on a date selected by the Company after consultation
with Parent) as promptly as practicable. The Company shall ensure that any
proxies solicited in connection with any Stockholders Meeting are solicited
in compliance with all applicable Laws.



Section 6.5 _No Solicitation_.



(a) The Company shall immediately terminate, and shall instruct its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives to immediately terminate, all existing
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Person conducted heretofore
with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal other than discussions or negotiations with the maker of
the Existing Proposal. The Company shall promptly demand that each Person
(other than Parent and its Affiliates and the maker of the Existing Proposal)
which has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement with or for the
benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
Representatives with respect to such Persons consideration of a possible
Acquisition Proposal promptly return or destroy (and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such destruction to be certified
in writing by such Person to the Company) all confidential information
heretofore furnished by the Acquired Companies or any of their Representatives
to such Person or any of its or their Representatives in accordance with the
terms of any confidentiality agreement with such Person. In addition, in the
event that negotiations with the Company regarding the Existing Proposal are
terminated by the Company or the maker of the Existing Proposal following the
date hereof, the Company shall request that such Person promptly return
or destroy (and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any such destruction to be certified in writing by such Person to the
Company) all confidential information furnished (at anytime) by the Acquired
Companies or any of their Representatives to such Person or any of its or
their Representatives in accordance with the terms of the confidentiality
agreement between the Company (or if applicable, a Subsidiary of the Company)
and such Person. The term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any offer or
proposal (whether or not in writing) (other than an offer or proposal by or on
behalf of Parent) for or any indication of interest or inquiry which could
reasonably be expected to lead to an offer or proposal for (an " _Acquisition
Transaction_ "): (i) a transaction pursuant to which any Person (or  



 

42  group of Persons) acquires or would acquire beneficial ownership of more
than 20% of the outstanding voting power of the Company, whether from the
Company or pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer or otherwise; (ii) a
merger, consolidation, business combination, reorganization, share exchange,
sale of substantially all assets, recapitalization or similar transaction
which would result in any Person (or group of Persons) other than Parent,
Acquisition or any of their Affiliates (any such Person, a " _Third Party_ ")
acquiring 20% or more of the fair market value of the assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) any transaction which would
result in a Third Party acquiring 20% or more of the fair market value of the
assets (including, without limitation, the capital stock of any Subsidiary of
the Company) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
immediately prior to such transaction (whether by purchase of assets,
acquisition of stock of a Subsidiary of the Company or otherwise); or (iv) any
combination of the foregoing.



(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time (or such earlier
date as this Agreement may be terminated pursuant to Article VIII), the
Company shall not, and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their Representatives not to, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly or
negligently facilitate, encourage or induce the making, submission
or announcement of, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish any nonpublic
information regarding any of the Acquired Companies to any Person that has
made an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with
any Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of intent or
similar agreement in principle or any Contract contemplating or otherwise
relating to any Acquisition Transaction (other than any confidentiality
agreement that does not contain an offer or proposal); _provided_ , _however_
, that, notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary,
unless the Required Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained, the
Company and its Representatives may take any actions described in clauses (ii)
and (iii) of this Section 6.5(b), in respect of a Person that has made an
Acquisition Proposal (other than the Existing Proposal) if, but only if, (A)
such Person has submitted an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal which
did not result from a violation by the Acquired Companies of this Section 6.5,
(B) prior to furnishing any nonpublic information regarding any of the
Acquired Companies to such Person, (x) such Person has entered into a
confidentiality agreement with the Company with use and disclosure
limitations, "standstill" provisions and other material terms that are no less
favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreements and (y) the
Company shall disclose all such disclosed information to Parent unless
previously provided to Parent, (C) the Board of Directors concludes in good
faith, based on such matters as it deems relevant, after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal is
or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (D) the
Board of Directors concludes in good faith, based on such matters as it deems
relevant, following consultation with outside counsel which frequently
provides advice with respect to the DGCL, that such action is necessary for
the Board of Directors to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties
imposed by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to
the contrary, unless the Required Stockholder Approval shall have been
obtained, the Company and its Representatives may take any of the actions
specified in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the first sentence of this
Section 6.5(b) with respect to the Existing Proposal, provided that (I) the
Company shall disclose all information which is disclosed to the maker of the
Existing Proposal to Parent unless previously provided to Parent and (II) the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into a confidentiality
and "standstill" agreement with the maker of the Existing Proposal. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company acknowledges and agrees
that any violation of or the taking of any action inconsistent with any of
the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of
any of the Acquired Companies shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this
Section 6.5 by the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Superior
Proposal_ " means any bona-fide written offer made by a Third Party for an
Acquisition Transaction (with all of the percentages included in the  



 

43  definition of Acquisition Transaction increased to 100% for purposes of this
definition) that the Board of Directors determines in good faith, based on
such matters as it deems relevant, following consultation with its financial
advisors and outside counsel, (x) would result in a transaction, if
consummated, that would be more favorable to the Stockholders (taking into
account all facts and circumstances, including all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the identity of the offeror
and any Revised Offer made by Parent under Section 6.5(d)) than the
transactions contemplated hereby, (y) is reasonably likely to be consummated
in a timely manner (taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and
other relevant considerations), and (z) is made by a Person or group of
Persons who have provided the Company with reasonable evidence that
such Person or group has or will have sufficient funds to complete such
Acquisition Proposal.



(c) The Company shall promptly advise Parent, telephonically and in writing,
of the Companys receipt of any Acquisition Proposal but in no event more than
forty-eight (48) hours thereafter. The Company shall promptly notify Parent,
in writing and in reasonable detail, of the material terms and conditions of
any such Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making the same.
The Company shall update Parent in respect of material changes in the status
of any Acquisition Proposal (including the Existing Proposal) and shall
promptly inform Parent of any change in any of the price, form of
consideration or other material terms of any Acquisition Proposal (including
the Existing Proposal). Promptly upon determination by the Board of Directors
that an Acquisition Proposal (including the Existing Proposal) constitutes a
Superior Proposal, the Company shall deliver to Parent a written notice
advising it that the Board of Directors has so determined, specifying in
reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
and the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal.



(d) Except as provided in the next sentence, the Board of Directors shall not
withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to
Parent and Acquisition. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, unless the Required Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained,
the Board of Directors shall be permitted to (i) withdraw or modify the
Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent and Acquisition or
not make or not continue to make the Company Board Recommendation or (ii)
approve, endorse or recommend, or cause the Company to enter into a letter of
intent or similar agreement in principle or any Contract contemplating or
otherwise relating to, a Superior Proposal if, but only if, in each case (A)
the Board of Directors has determined in good faith, based on such matters as
it deems relevant, following consultation with outside counsel which
frequently provides advice with respect to the DGCL, that such action is
necessary for the Board of Directors to act in a manner consistent with its
fiduciary duties imposed by applicable Law and (B) the Company has given
Parent seventy-two (72) hours prior written notice of its intention to
withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation or not make or continue to
make the Company Board Recommendation or approve, endorse or recommend or
enter into such letter of intent, agreement in principle or Contract, and with
respect to any Superior Proposal, Parent has not made, during such 72-hour
period, an offer (a " _Revised Offer_ ") that the Board of Directors of the
Company, in its good faith judgment, based on such matters as it deems
relevant, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel,
determines is at least as favorable to the Stockholders as the Superior
Proposal (provided, that during such 72-hour period, the Company shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate)
to enable Parent to make such a Revised Offer).



 

44 The Company may, if it receives an Acquisition Proposal, delay the mailing of
the Proxy Statement, the filing of the Schedule 13E-3 or the holding of the
Stockholders Meeting, in each case to provide a reasonable opportunity for the
Board of Directors to consider such Acquisition Proposal and to determine the
effect, if any, on the Company Board Recommendation. 



Section 6.6 _Regulatory Approvals; Consents_. 



(a) Subject to Section 6.6(c), Parent, Acquisition and the Company shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary to cause the conditions contained in Article VII hereof to
be satisfied in a timely manner and to consummate the Merger and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to Section 6.6(c),
Parent and the Company (i) shall make all filings (if any) and give all

submit promptly any additional information requested in connection with such
filings and notices, (ii) shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain each consent (if any) required to be obtained (pursuant to any
applicable Law or Contract, or otherwise) by such party in connection with the
Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(iii) shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to oppose or lift any
restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Merger. Each of the Company
and Parent shall promptly deliver to the other a copy of each such filing
made, each such notice given and each such Consent obtained from and after
the date hereof through the Effective Time.



(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.6(a), the Company and Parent
shall, promptly after the date of this Agreement, prepare and file the
notifications required under the HSR Act and any applicable foreign antitrust
Laws in connection with the Merger. The Company and Parent shall respond as
promptly as practicable to any inquiries or requests received from any
Governmental Authority in connection with antitrust Laws or related matters.
Each of the Company and Parent shall (i) give the other party prompt notice
of the commencement or threat of commencement of any Legal Proceeding by or
before any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (ii) keep the other party informed
as to the status of any such Legal Proceeding or threat and (iii) promptly
inform the other party of any communication concerning antitrust Laws to or
from any Governmental Authority regarding the Merger. Except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by applicable Law, the Company and
Parent will consult and cooperate with one another, and will consider in good
faith the views of one another, in connection with any analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal
made or submitted in connection with any Legal Proceeding under or relating to
the HSR Act or any other antitrust Law. Except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Authority or by applicable Law, in connection with any Legal
Proceeding under or relating to the HSR Act or any other foreign, federal or
state antitrust Law or fair trade Law or any other similar Legal Proceeding,
each of the Company and Parent will permit authorized Representatives of the
other to be present at each meeting or conference relating to any such Legal
Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any
document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Authority
in connection with any such Legal Proceeding.



 

45 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent shall not have any obligation under this Agreement: (i) to dispose,
transfer or hold separate, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to dispose,
transfer or hold separate any assets or operations, or to commit or to cause
any of the Acquired Companies to dispose of any assets; (ii) to discontinue
or cause any of its Subsidiaries to discontinue offering any product or
service, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Companies to discontinue
offering any product or service; or (iii) to make or cause any of
its Subsidiaries to make any commitment (to any Governmental Authority or
otherwise) regarding its future operations or the future operations of any of
the Acquired Companies.



(d) Parent and the Company shall furnish all information required to be
included in any application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules
and regulations of any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and the Company shall have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent reasonably practicable each
will consult the other on, all the information relating to the other and each
of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any Third Party or any Governmental Authority
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



Section 6.7 _Notices of Certain Events_.



(a) The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable of (i) any
notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person (or another Person) is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any event, condition, fact
or circumstance that occurs, arises or exists after the date of this Agreement
and that would cause or constitute a material inaccuracy in any representation
or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement or (iii) any event,
condition, fact or circumstance that would make the timely satisfaction of any
of the conditions set forth in Article VII impossible or unlikely or that has
had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person (or another Person) is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any event, condition, fact
or circumstance that occurs, arises or exists after the date of this Agreement
and that would cause or constitute a material inaccuracy in any representation
or warranty made by Parent or Acquisition or (iii) any event, condition, fact
or circumstance that would make the timely satisfaction of any of the
conditions set forth in Article VII impossible or unlikely or that has had or
is reasonably likely to have a material adverse affect on the ability of
Parent and Acquisition to perform their obligations under this Agreement and
consummate and the transactions contemplated hereby in a timely manner.



Section 6.8 _Financing_. __



(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent and Acquisition will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange the Debt Financing, including, without
limitation, entering into definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms
and conditions substantially in accordance  



 

46  with those set forth in the Financing Commitment. In the event that any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable so as to not enable Parent
and Acquisition to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in a timely manner, Parent and Acquisition will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain alternate debt financing
from alternative sources on comparable or more favorable terms to those set
forth in the Financing Commitment as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, including, without limitation, entering into
definitive agreements with respect thereto (such definitive agreements
entered into pursuant to the first or second sentence of this Section 6.8(a)
being referred to as the " _Definitive Financing Agreements_ "). Parent and
Acquisition will, will cause their Affiliates to, and will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their Representatives to, comply with
the terms and satisfy on a timely basis the conditions of the Financing
Commitment, any alternate financing commitment and the Definitive Financing
Agreements and any related fee and engagement letters. Any material breach of
the Financing Commitment, the Definitive Financing Agreements, any alternate
financing commitment and any related fee and engagement letters by JWC, OSIM
or Temasek shall be deemed a breach by Parent of this Section 6.8. Parent
will (i) furnish correct and complete copies of the Definitive Financing
Agreements to the Company promptly upon their execution and (ii) give the
Company prompt notice of any breach by any party of the Financing Commitment,
any alternate financing commitment or the Definitive Financing Agreements of
which Parent becomes aware or any termination thereof. For purposes of this
Section 6.8, "commercially reasonable efforts" shall not be deemed to require
that Parent compromise any of the economic or other material terms (considered
on an aggregate basis) contained in the Financing Commitments.



 

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to,
at Parents sole expense, (a) reasonably cooperate with Parent and Parents
Affiliates in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing (or any
replacements thereof), including, without limitation, the execution and
delivery, at the Closing, of any pledge or security documents, underwriting
or placement arrangements, other definitive financing documents or other
requested certificates or financial information, including a certificate of
the chief financial officer of the Company with respect to solvency matters,
comfort letters of accountants and legal opinions, in each case, as may be
reasonably requested by Parent or Parents Affiliates in connection with such
financing, and (b) reasonably assist in marketing such financing, which such
marketing assistance shall include, but not be limited to, (i) assisting in
the preparation of road show materials and supplementing and updating any such
materials, (ii) participating in road show presentations (including one-on-
one meetings) with proposed purchasers of such financing and (iii) assisting
in the preparation of the prospectus or offering memorandum, as the case may
be, relating to such financing and any amendments or supplements thereto;
_provided, however,_ that such requested cooperation and assistance shall not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Acquired Companies;
_provided further_ that no Acquired Company shall be required to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection

(a) Parent agrees (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries to agree from and after the Effective Time) that all rights
to indemnification and all limitations on liability now existing in favor of
any current or former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the
Company Organizational Documents or in any Company Benefit Plan (excluding
the CEOs change in control agreement with the Company) as in effect as of the
date hereof shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time.



(b) In addition to the other rights provided for in this Section 6.9 and not
in limitation thereof, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to indemnify and hold harmless (and release from any
liability to the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) all
Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws with
respect to all acts and omissions occurring, or otherwise relating to their
services as directors,  



 

48  officers, employees or agents of the Company or its Subsidiaries, at or
prior to the Effective Time including, without limitation, in respect of the
matters set forth herein. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, and provide advancement of

otherwise relating to their services as directors, officers, employees or
agents of the Company or its Subsidiaries, at or prior to the Effective Time
including, without limitation, in respect of the matters set forth herein.



(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to (and if it is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving

insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier covering each such Person currently covered by the
Companys existing policies with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance in an amount and on terms with respect to coverage at least as
favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. If the Company and/or the
Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance described in the prior
sentence for an amount less than or equal to the Maximum Aggregate Premium,
it shall instead obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual
premium equal to the Maximum Aggregate Premium.

(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent
necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.9. The rights of each Indemnified
Person under this Section 6.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified
Party.

The Company shall not cooperate with any Person that may seek to restrain,
enjoin, prohibit or otherwise oppose the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the Company shall reasonably cooperate in good faith with
Parent and Acquisition in resisting any such effort to restrain, enjoin,
prohibit or otherwise oppose such transactions. The Company shall give Parent

respect of such Legal Proceeding without Parents prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed; and

or delayed: (i) not make, change or revoke any material Tax election, (ii) not
amend any Tax Return or adopt or change a Tax accounting method or Tax

periods of service with the Acquired Companies before the Closing for all
purposes to the extent required by applicable Law and otherwise for purposes
of participation, vesting and benefits levels where length of service is
relevant to benefit levels, but not for benefit accrual under any plan or any
accrual that would result in any duplication of benefits, and any waiting
period for participation shall be waived.
