(b) (i) _Company Common Stock_. Subject to the provisions of this Section
3.01(b) and Sections 3.05, 3.06 3.10 and 8.01(d)(iii), each share of Company

shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (1) $21.50 divided by (2) the Parent
Average Share Price, rounded to four decimal places (by way of example and for

total per share Merger Consideration would amount to $29.00, consisting of
$7.50 in cash and $21.50 in Parent Common Stock, i.e., 0.6515 shares
($21.50/$33.00 = 0.6515));

$7.50 in cash and (B) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
quotient of (1) the Parent Average Share Price less $7.50, divided by (2) the

consisting of $7.50 in cash and $19.50 in Parent Common Stock, i.e., 0.7222

(AA) Parent issues or sells

 



      
 

 



 

any shares of Parent Common Stock or securities convertible into shares of
Parent Common Stock, other than shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of Parent Rights outstanding on the date hereof or Parent stock
options issued after the date hereof in the Ordinary Course of Business, and
(BB) the Parent Average Share Price is less than $28.00, each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time

provision a number of shares of Parent Common Stock which exceeds 19.9% of the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if at the time of
the Closing, the value of Aggregate Stock Consideration is less than 45% of
the Aggregate Merger Consideration, then the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration shall be reduced by the amount necessary to cause the Aggregate
Cash Consideration to equal 55% of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, and the
Exchange Ratio shall be increased by the number of shares necessary to cause
the Aggregate Stock Consideration to equal 45% of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration.

 



 

3.02 _[Intentionally Omitted]_

 



 

3.03 _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Mailing of Transmittal Material_. The agent designated by Parent (who, if
different than Parents then serving registrar and transfer agent, is
reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as the exchange agent for
purposes of the Merger (the "Exchange Agent") shall, and Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to, mail or deliver to each holder of record of Company
Common Stock not later than 10 days following mailing of the Proxy Statement,
a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificate(s) theretofore
representing shares of Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of such Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent or transfer of Book-
Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and which shall have been approved in form
by the Company) advising such holder of the procedure for surrendering to the
Exchange Agent such Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
consideration to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to _Section
3.01(b)_ hereof deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. For
those holders of Company Common Stock who have not surrendered a properly
completed letter of transmittal and Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares
evidencing the shares of

 



      
 

 



 

Company Common Stock prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
send such holders another letter of transmittal promptly following the
Closing.

 



 

(b) _Parent Deliveries_. At least one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing,
for the benefit of the holders of Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares, (i)
Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent certificates, or at Parents
option, evidence of shares in book entry form, representing the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the holders of Company Common Stock
as part of the Merger Consideration and (ii) Parent shall deliver, or cause
Bank Subsidiary to deliver, to the Exchange Agent, the cash portion of the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this _Article III_, each to be given
to the holders of Company Common Stock in exchange for their Certificate(s)
and Book-Entry Shares as provided in this _Article III_. The Exchange Agent
shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect
to the shares of Parent Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder,
except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions
paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account of the Persons
entitled thereto.

 



 

(c) _Exchange Agent Deliveries_.

 



 

(i) Upon the Closing, each holder of an outstanding Certificate(s) or Book-
Entry Shares who has surrendered such Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares to
the Exchange Agent will, upon acceptance thereof by the Exchange Agent, be
entitled to evidence of issuance in book entry form, or upon written request
of such holder a certificate or certificates representing, the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of cash into which the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement and any other distribution theretofore paid with
respect to Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger, in each case, without
interest. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices.

 



 

(ii) If a holder of Company Common Stock surrenders its Certificate(s) and/or
Book-Entry Shares and a properly executed letter of transmittal to the
Exchange Agent at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, then
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver, within five (5) Business
Days following the Closing Date, to such holder the Merger Consideration into
which the shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby have been
converted pursuant to _Section 3.01(b)_. If a holder of Company Common Stock
surrenders such Certificate(s) and/or Book-Entry Shares and a properly
executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent at any time after five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, then Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to promptly, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days
following receipt of such Certificate(s) and/or Book-Entry Shares and properly
executed letter of transmittal, deliver to such holder the Merger
Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented
thereby have been converted pursuant to _Section 3.01(b)_.

 



 

(iii) Each outstanding Certificate or Book-Entry Share which is not
surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the procedures provided
for herein shall,

 



      
 

 



 

except as otherwise herein provided, until duly surrendered to the Exchange
Agent, be deemed to evidence ownership of the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock and/or the right to receive the amount of cash into which such
Company Common Stock shall have been converted. After the Effective Time,
there shall be no further transfer on the records of the Company of
Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares and, if such Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Company for transfer, they shall be cancelled
against delivery of certificates for Parent Common Stock and/or cash as
hereinabove provided. No dividends which have been declared will be remitted
to any Person entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock under _Section
3.02_ until such Person surrenders the Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares
representing Company Common Stock, at which time such dividends shall be
remitted to such Person, without interest.

 



 

(d) _Lost or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount required by the practices and
policies of the Exchange Agent and/or Parents transfer agent, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect to each share
of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.

 



 

(e) _Unclaimed Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the shares of Parent
Common Stock and cash delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to
_Section 3.03(b)_ that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company
for six months after the Effective Time (as well as any proceeds from any
investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Parent. Any
shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with _Section
3.03(c)_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for the consideration
deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder
holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement without any interest thereon.
In the event that any former shareholder of the Company shall not have
properly surrendered his or her Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing
shares of Company Common Stock within such period, the shares of Parent Common
Stock that would otherwise have been issued to such shareholder may, at the
option of Parent, be sold and the net proceeds of such sale, together with any
cash in respect of fractional shares and any previously accrued dividends, and
the Per Share Cash Consideration in respect of such holders shares of Company
Common Stock, shall be held by Parent for such shareholders benefit in a non-
interest bearing deposit account at Bank Subsidiary or another depository
institution, the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), chosen by Parent in its discretion, and
the sole right of such shareholder shall be the right to receive any
certificates for Parent Common Stock which have not been so sold, and to
collect cash in such account, without interest. Subject to all applicable laws
of escheat, such amounts shall be paid to such former shareholder of Company,
without interest, upon proper surrender of his or her Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall
be liable to any holder of stock represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares for any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Parent and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of the Company to
establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the consideration
specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive

 



      
 

 



 

with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of
stock represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, Parent and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any consideration represented
thereby in escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved
with respect to any claims thereto.

 



 

3.04 _Rights as Shareholders_. At the Effective Time, holders of Company
Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of
the Company other than to receive the consideration provided under this
_Article III_.

 



 

3.05 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of Company Common
Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificate(s) or Book-
Entry Shares surrendered by such holder) shall receive in lieu thereof cash
(without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share
interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by the Parent
Average Share Price, rounded to the nearest whole cent (with one-half cent
being rounded upward). No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting
rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share.

 



 

3.06 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. If, between the date hereof and the Effective
Time, the shares of Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend
thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Exchange
Ratio and any amounts dependent on the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted
accordingly; provided that an offering or sale of Parent Common Stock shall
not be deemed a reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or readjustment of the Parent Common Stock.

 



 

3.07 _Withholding Rights_. Parent (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable)
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
such amounts as Parent is required under the Code or any state, local or
foreign Tax law or regulation thereunder to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment. Any amounts so withheld shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent.

 



 

3.08 _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each option to acquire Company
Common Stock (the "Company Stock Options") outstanding under the Company 2006
Stock Option Plan or 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan (each a "Company Stock
Plan" and collectively, the "Company Stock Plans") issued and outstanding at
the Effective Time, shall be converted into and become options to purchase
Parent Common Stock. Parent shall assume each Company Stock Option in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company Stock Plan, the
agreements evidencing grants thereunder and any other agreements between the
Company and an optionee regarding Company Stock Options; provided, however,
that from and after the Effective Time, a Company Stock Option shall be
exercisable solely for Parent Common Stock; the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock which may be acquired pursuant to such Company Stock Option shall
be determined by: (A) dividing the Exchange Ratio by 0.741321, rounded to

 



      
 

 



 

four decimal places (the "Option Exchange Ratio"), provided that the Option
Exchange Ratio shall not exceed 1.0000 or be less than 0.8169, and (B)
multiplying the Option Exchange Ratio by the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such option, rounded down to the nearest whole share;
and the exercise price per share shall be equal to the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock divided by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up
to the nearest cent. It is intended that the foregoing assumption and
adjustment shall be effected in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 424 of the Code, as to each Company Stock Option which is an incentive
stock option. To the extent that the foregoing assumption and adjustment shall
not be consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code, be
impermissible under any agreement evidencing a grant under the Company Stock
Plans or other agreement between the Company and an optionee regarding Company
Stock Options, or otherwise be impermissible, then the Company Stock Options
shall be equitably adjusted to be exercisable for such consideration or
combination of forms of consideration as Parent and Company may agree.

 



 

3.09 _Reservation of Shares_. Prior to the Closing, the Parent Board shall
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for
the purpose of issuing its shares in exchange for shares of Company Common
Stock in the Merger.

 



 

3.10 _Changes in Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the number of outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into, or exchanged
for, a different number of shares or a different class of shares, by reason of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), combination or exchange of shares,
the Merger Consideration and any similarly dependent items, such as any
applicable exchange ratio, shall be correspondingly adjusted to provide the
holders of Company Common Stock and other securities the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 



 

3.11 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement be, and is hereby adopted
as, a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES**

 



 

5.01 _Disclosure Schedules_. On or prior to the date hereof, Parent has
delivered to the Company a schedule and the Company has delivered to Parent a
schedule (each respectively, its " _Disclosure Schedule_ ") setting forth,
among other things, items the disclosure of which is

 



      
 

 



 

necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more
representations or warranties contained in _Section 5.03_ or _5.04_ or to one
or more of its covenants contained in _Articles IV_ and _VI_ ; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the mere inclusion of an item in a Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by
a party that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance or that, absent such inclusion in the Disclosure Schedule, such
item is or would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.02 _[Intentionally Omitted]_

 



 

5.03 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Subject to _Section
5.01_, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent:

 



 

(a) _Organization, Standing and Authority_. The Company is duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Virginia. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where its ownership or leasing of property
or assets or the conduct of its business requires it to be so licensed or
qualified, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not
have nor reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. The Company has in effect all federal, state, local and foreign
governmental authorizations necessary for it to own or lease its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. The deposit accounts
of the Company are insured by the FDIC in the manner and to the maximum extent
provided by applicable law, and the Company has paid all deposit insurance
premiums and assessments required by applicable laws and regulations. The
copies of the Company Articles and the Company Bylaws which have previously
been made available to Parent are true, complete and correct copies of such
documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Capital Stock_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
15,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, of which 6,018,801 shares are
issued and outstanding as of the date hereof, and 5,000,000 shares of Company
Preferred Stock, of which 15,300 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were
issued and outstanding as of the date hereof. As of the date hereof, no shares
of Company Common Stock were held in treasury by the Company or otherwise
directly or indirectly owned by the Company. The outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, and none of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock have
been issued in violation of the preemptive rights of any Person. _Section
5.03(b)_ of the Companys Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the date
hereof, for each Company Stock Option, the name of the grantee, the date of
the grant, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each
Company Stock Option and the exercise or strike price per share. Except as set
forth in the preceding sentence, there are no shares of Company Common Stock

in the Companys Loan portfolio, and recourse obligations in respect of

recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means that are under the
exclusive ownership and direct control of the Company or its accountants,
except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the system of
internal accounting controls described below. The Company has established and
maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting that pertain

expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Company
management and Board of Directors, and provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of Company assets that could have a material effect on the financial

financial reporting and the preparation of the Companys financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has no Knowledge of
(i) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or
operation of its internal control over financial reporting which are

material, that involves management or other employees who have a role in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. The Company (A) has

Officer of the Company by others within the Company and (B) has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to the Companys
outside auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (x) any

ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (y)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over

available to Parent. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective for
the purposes for which they were established.

the Company, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or
representative of the Company, has received any material complaint,

accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the
Company or its internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that the Company has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and (B) no attorney representing the
Company, whether or not employed by the Company, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar

officer and chief financial officer of Parent required under the Exchange Act

(B) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date
hereof, to Parents outside auditors and the audit committee of Parent Board

result of debts previously contracted).

 



 

(u) _Tax Treatment_. Each of Parent and Bank Subsidiary has not taken or
agreed to take any action, and does not have knowledge of any fact or
circumstance, that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a

fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. The parties shall make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the previous
sentence apply.

 



 

(b) All information furnished pursuant to this _Section 6.06_ shall be
subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement,
dated as of April 9, 2014 between Parent and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



 

6.07 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) The Company agrees that it shall immediately cease, and shall cause its
directors, officers, employees, advisors and agents (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, immediately cease all existing discussions or
negotiations with any person (other than Parent and its Affiliates and
Representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any proposal that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal. Except as expressly permitted in this _Section 6.07_, from the date
of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any,
on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_, the Company
shall not, and its Representatives shall not, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into, or otherwise participate in any discussions (except to notify such
person of the existence of the provisions of this _Section 6.07_) or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) furnish to any person
any information concerning the Company, or any access to the properties, books
and records of the Company in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, or
(iv) propose, agree or publicly announce an intention to take any of the
foregoing actions or any other action which would reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
6.07_, if at any time after the date hereof and prior to obtaining the
Shareholder Approval, the Company or any of its Representatives, receives a
written Acquisition Proposal, the Company, the Company Board and their
respective Representatives may engage in negotiations and discussions with,
and furnish any information and other access to (so long as all such
information and access has previously been made available to Parent or is made
available to Parent prior to or concurrently with the time such information is
made available to such person), any person making such Acquisition Proposal
and its Representatives if, and only if, the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial
advisors, and based on such advice and information provided in such
consultations that (i) such Acquisition Proposal is or is reasonably capable
of becoming a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure of the Company Board to
furnish such information or access or enter into such discussions or
negotiations would reasonably be expected to violate its fiduciary duties to
the shareholders of the Company under applicable law; _provided_ that prior to
furnishing any material nonpublic information, the Company shall have received
from the person making such Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality
agreement with terms at least as restrictive in all material respects on such
person as the Confidentiality Agreement is on Parent, which confidentiality
agreement shall not prohibit the Company from complying with the terms of this
_Section 6.07_. The Company will promptly, and in any event within 24 hours
(x) notify Parent in writing of the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal and
(y) communicate the material terms of

 



      
 

 



 

such Acquisition Proposal to Parent. The Company will keep Parent reasonably
apprised of the status of and other matters relating to any such Acquisition
Proposal on a timely basis.

 



 

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.07_, neither the Company
nor the Company Board shall (i)(A) withdraw, modify or qualify, or publicly
propose to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation or (B) approve or recommend, or publicly propose
to approve or recommend, to the shareholders of the Company any Acquisition
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "
_Change of Recommendation_ ") or (ii) authorize, approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or propose to adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
option agreement, securities purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, or
similar agreement with respect to, or that is intended to or would reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in _Section 6.07(b)_ pursuant to and in accordance with
the limitations set forth therein).

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may make a
Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(d)(ii)_, if (1) the Company Board receives a written Acquisition Proposal
from any person that is not withdrawn and (2) the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal; _provided_ that:

 



 

(i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be violate its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the Company under applicable law; and

 



 

(ii) with respect to a Superior Proposal:

 



 

(1) the Company provides Parent prior written notice at least five (5)
business days prior to taking such action, which notice shall state that the
Company Board has received a Superior Proposal and, absent any revision to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board has resolved to
effect a Change of Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01(d)(ii)_, as applicable, which notice shall specify the basis
for such Change of Recommendation or termination, including the material terms
of the Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") (it being
understood that such Notice of Superior Proposal shall not in and of itself be
deemed a Change of Recommendation);

 



 

(2) during such five (5) business day period, the Company negotiates in good
faith with Parent (to the extent that Parent wishes to negotiate) to enable
Parent to make an offer that is at least as favorable to the shareholders of
the Company so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal; and

 



      
 

 



 

(3) at the end of such five (5) business day period (or such earlier time that
Parent advises the Company that it no longer wishes to negotiate to amend this
Agreement), the Company Board, after taking into account any modifications to
the terms of this Agreement and the Merger agreed to by Parent and Bank
Subsidiary after receipt of such notice, continues to believe that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

 



 

It is understood that and agreed that any amendment to the financial or other
material terms of the Acquisition Proposal giving rise to the Notice of
Superior Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal giving rise to a
new five (5) business day response period for Parent.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the shareholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or
making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule
14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders
of the Company if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company
to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be a violation of
applicable law or (iii) informing any person of the existence of the
provisions contained in this _Section 6.07_; it being understood that a
"stop, look and listen" communication to the shareholders of the Company
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to the shareholders of the Company) shall not be deemed to be or
constitute a Change of Recommendation.

 



 

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any
written proposal or offer from any person (other than Parent, Bank Subsidiary
and any Affiliates thereof) received by Company without violation of Section
6.07(a) by the Company or its representatives, relating to, or that is
reasonably expected to lead to, any direct or indirect purchase or
acquisition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, of (A)
any assets or businesses of the Company that constitute 25% or more of the
Companys consolidated assets or (B) beneficial ownership (as defined under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of 25% or more of the total outstanding
voting securities of the Company pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other
business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer, exchange
offer or similar transaction.

 



 

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal on terms which the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and
independent financial advisors, and taking into account all the legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal, would,
if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable to the holders
of Company Common Stock from a financial point of view than the terms of this
Agreement (in each case, taking into account any revisions to this Agreement
made or proposed by Parent); _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of
"Superior Proposal," the references to "25%" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

 



 

6.08 _Exchange Listing_. Parent shall, as promptly as practicable, file all
documents, take all actions reasonably necessary and otherwise use its
reasonable best efforts to list, as of the Effective Date, on NASDAQ the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to the Company shareholders as part
of the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger.

 



   

     
 

 



 

6.09 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and the Surviving Bank agrees that, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time (including any matter in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the
current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any
persons who are or were serving at the request of the Company as a director,
officer, trustee, fiduciary, employee or agent of another entity (including
any employee benefit plan) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), as
provided in the Company Articles or Company Bylaws or other indemnification
agreements in effect as of the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in a
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such individuals
for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, and through the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Bank agrees that it shall
jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party, and
any person who becomes an Indemnified Party between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
and amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law (and Parent and the Surviving Bank
shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, _provided_ that if required by applicable law, the person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification).

 



 

(c) Parent shall provide for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary insurance to
reimburse the present and former officers and directors of the Company
covering, without limitation, claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Effective Time, including the transactions
contemplated hereby, which insurance shall contain terms and conditions
(including with respect to coverage) no less advantageous to the Indemnified
Parties than the existing directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary insurance maintained by the Company as of the date hereof;
_provided_ that in no event shall Parent be required to expend in the
aggregate an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by
the Company for such insurance (the " _Insurance Amount_ ") and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if Parent is unable to maintain such policy (or substitute
policy) as a result of the preceding proviso, Parent shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as is available for a period of six (6) years following
the Effective Time. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent, or the Company in
consultation with Parent for an aggregate price of no more than 300% of the
Insurance Amount, may obtain, on or prior to the Effective Time, a six (6)
year "tail" prepaid policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in
the preceding sentence. From and after the Effective Time, neither Parent, the
Surviving Bank nor the Company shall

 



      
 

 



 

take any action that would materially prejudice the rights of, or otherwise
impede recovery by, the beneficiaries of any insurance policy contemplated by
this _Section 6.05(c)_, whether in respect of claims arising before or after
the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Bank under this _Section
6.09_ shall not be terminated or modified by such parties in a manner so as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Person, or any other person entitled to the
benefit of this _Section 6.09_, to whom this _Section 6.09_ applies without
the consent of the affected Indemnified Person or such other person, as the
case may be. If Parent or the Surviving Bank or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Bank, as the
case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.09_.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.09_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and each other
person entitled to the benefit of this _Section 6.09_, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have by contract or otherwise.

 



 

6.10 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Bank to, give those
individuals who are employed by the Company immediately prior to the Closing
and who continue to be employed by Parent or Bank Subsidiary following the
Effective Time (other than on a temporary or a transition basis of less than
six months) (each such employee, a " _Covered Employee_ ") full credit for
purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual and determination of the
level of benefits under any employee benefit plans or arrangements that such
employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date for such
Covered Employees service with the Company to the same extent recognized by
the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not result in the duplication of benefits for the same period
of service.

 



 

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to cause medical, dental or other
health or benefit plans to: (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Covered Employees under any welfare
benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the
Closing Date, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in
effect with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of
the Closing Date under any welfare plan maintained for the Covered Employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) provide each Covered Employee
with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid in the plan year in which
the Closing Date occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under any welfare plans in which employees are eligible to
participate after the Closing Date. In the case of any such benefit plan under
which benefits are provided through insurance, Parents agreement to credit
prior service is subject to the consent of the applicable insurer, which
Parent shall use reasonable efforts to obtain.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) For a period of six months following the Closing Date, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Bank to, provide to Covered Employees base
compensation and incentive compensation opportunities no less favorable than
those provided to such Covered Employees by the Company immediately prior to
the Closing Date and (ii) without limiting subsection (i), benefits that are
not materially less favorable in the aggregate than the benefits provided by
the Company to such Covered Employees pursuant to the Company Benefit Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Covered Employees will be eligible to
participate in Parents employee benefit plans on the same basis as similarly
situated Parent employees and will receive credit for prior years of service
in determining eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accruals). Nothing
contained herein shall create or be deemed to create, directly or indirectly,
any legal or equitable right of any Covered Employee to continue service with
the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, and it shall not be deemed to interfere
in any way with Parents or any Parent Subsidiarys right to terminate, or
otherwise modify, a Covered Employees employment at any time.

 



 

(d) Without limiting _Section 6.10(c)_, Parent agrees that each Covered
Employee (other than any Covered Employee who is subject to an employment,
severance, change in control, consulting, retirement and other compensation
contracts, arrangements, commitments or understandings with Company pursuant
to which a severance, termination, change in control or similar payment will
be or has been paid in connection with such Covered Employees
termination),who is involuntarily terminated by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than for cause) on or within nine months of the Effective
Date, shall receive a severance payment equal to two weeks of base pay (at the
rate in effect on the termination date) for each year of service at the
Company (with proportional credit for partial years of service) with a minimum
payment equal to four weeks of base pay.

 



 

(e) Without limiting _Section 6.10(c)_, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Bank to, provide to employees of the Company whose employment is
terminated on or within nine months of the Effective Date under circumstances
entitling the employee to severance benefits under paragraph (d) of this
_Section 6.10_ or under any applicable employment or severance agreement then
in effect, reasonable assistance in obtaining a new position for a period of
four months from the date of termination.

 



 

(f) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Bank to, assume and honor the
obligations of the Company under all employment, severance, change in control,
consulting, retirement and other compensation contracts, arrangements,
commitments or understandings, all of which have been identified in Section
5.03(m) of the Company Disclosure Letter, in accordance with their terms.
Parent hereby acknowledges that the Merger will constitute a "Change in
Control" (or concept of similar import) in accordance with the provisions of
the Company Benefit Plans. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Bank,
after consummation of the Merger to, pay all amounts provided under such
Company Benefit Plans and agreements as a result of a change in control of the
Company, in accordance with their respective terms and to the extent required
thereby, and to honor all rights, privileges and modifications to or with
respect to any such Company Benefit Plans or agreements which become effective
as a result of such change in control.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) This _Section 6.10_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 6.10_.

 



 

6.11 _Prohibited Purchases or Sales_. Neither Parent, any Parent Subsidiary,
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary, nor any director of any of the
foregoing, shall purchase or sell on the NASDAQ, or submit a bid to purchase
or an offer to sell on the NASDAQ, directly or indirectly, any shares of
Parent Common Stock or any options, warrants, rights or other securities
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Parent Common Stock during the
Parent Price Determination Period; provided that the foregoing restriction
shall not be applicable to (i) purchases or sales of Parent Stock held by
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent in trust, managed, custodial or nominee
accounts and the like, or held by mutual funds, (ii) shares acquired in
respect of debts previously contracted, (iii) purchases or sales of Parent
Stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations or for purposes of paying the
exercise price in respect of grants, exercises or vesting of equity based
compensation.

 



 

6.12 _Disclosure_. The Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure
Schedule called for by this Agreement shall be updated as of the Closing Date
for comparative and information purposes. Disclosure of an item for the first
time on such updated schedules shall not be considered as Previously Disclosed
in determining whether any representation or warranty is true or correct.

 



 

6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company, Parent and Bank
Subsidiary shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or
circumstance known to it that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken
together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result
in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (b) would cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained herein.

(b) by either the Company or Parent and Bank Subsidiary, if (i) any
Governmental Authority that must grant a requisite Regulatory Approval has
denied approval of the Merger and such denial has become final and
nonappealable; _provided_ that no party shall have the right to terminate this

to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or
observe the

 



      
 

 



 

covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein, or (ii) any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and
nonappealable order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise

ruling;

 



 

(c) by either the Company or Parent and Subsidiary, if (i) the Merger shall
not have been consummated on or before March 31, 2015 (the " _Outside Date_ ")
unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe
the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement or (ii)
the Company Meeting (including any adjournment or postponements thereof) shall
have concluded and the Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained;

 



 

(d) by the Company:

 



 

(i) if Parent or Bank Subsidiary shall have breached or failed to perform any

notice of such breach or failure to perform from the Company, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company is not then in material breach of any

(ii) in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a
transaction that the Company Board has determined constitutes a Superior
Proposal, if prior to the receipt of Shareholder Approval contemplated by this

Parent the amount specified and within the time period specified in _Section

(iii) at any time during the five-day period commencing with the Determination
Date, if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

number obtained by dividing (A) the product of the Starting Price, 0.80 and
the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) by (B) the Average Closing Price and

modify this Agreement, executed in the same manner as this Agreement, except

For purposes of clarification, an amendment of the date in _Section 8.01(c)_
shall not require further approval by any shareholders and if such amendment
were deemed by law to require further approval by the shareholders of the
Company, the approval of the principal terms of this Agreement by the Company
shareholders will be deemed to have granted the Company the authority to amend
such date without such further approval.

such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable
the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity

other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is

to the contrary, Parent may at any time modify the structure of the
acquisition of the Company set forth herein, provided that (i) the Merger
Consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Common Stock is not thereby

other jurisdiction. In the event that the scope or duration of any provision
hereof shall be found to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then such
provision shall be interpreted to provide for the broadest scope or longest
duration which would be enforceable in such jurisdiction.

11. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
