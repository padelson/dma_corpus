to make such amendments to the terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement as
would enable the Purchaser to proceed with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on such amended terms. If the Board of Directors determines

Company shall promptly so advise the Purchaser and the Company and the
Purchaser shall amend this Agreement to reflect such offer made by the
Purchaser, and shall take and cause to be taken all such actions as are

counsel) incurred by the Purchaser in connection with such suit. If the
Purchaser fails to pay the Reverse Break Fee when due hereunder, and, in
order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Purchaser for such amount, the Purchaser shall pay the
reasonable costs and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) incurred by the Company in connection with such suit. 
---|--- 
 



\- 57 -  Section 8.3 shall be paid free and clear of and without deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes, unless such
deduction or withholding is required by law. If a Party is required by
applicable laws to deduct or withhold any Taxes from any payment of a Break
Fee or Reverse Break Fee: 
---|--- 
 



     | (a) | the amount payable shall be increased as may be necessary so
that, after making all required deductions or withholdings (including
deductions and withholdings applicable to, and taking into account all Taxes
on, or arising by reason of, the payment of additional amounts under this
Section 8.3(5)), the Party to which the payment is due receives an amount
equal to the amount that it would have received had no such deductions or
withholdings been required; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the paying Party shall make such required deductions or
withholdings; and 
---|---|--- 



      | (c) | the paying Party shall remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the appropriate Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable laws.  
---|---|--- 



   (6) | Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that the Break Fee and the
Reverse Break Fee set out in this Section 8.3 are payments of liquidated
damages which are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages which the Purchaser
or the Company, as applicable, will suffer or incur as a result of the event
giving rise to such payment and the resultant termination of this Agreement
and are not penalties. Each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may
have to raise as a defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or
punitive. Each Party agrees that the payment of the Break Fee or Reverse Break
Fee, as applicable, in accordance with this Section 8.3 is the sole monetary
remedy of such Party in respect of the event giving rise to the payment
(subject to Section 8.3(4)). The Parties shall also have the right to
injunctive relief and other equitable relief in accordance with Section 9.2
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
compliance with the terms of this Agreement. For greater certainty, the
Company shall not be required to pay the Break Fee more than once. 
---|--- 
 

Section 8.4 Notice and Effect of Termination



   (1) | The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.2 (other than pursuant to Section 8.2(a)) shall give notice of such
termination to the other Party setting out in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances giving rise to such Partys right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.2. 
---|--- 
 



   (2) | If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.2, this
Agreement shall become void and of no effect without liability of any Party
(or any shareholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or
representative of such Party) to the other Party hereto, except that: 
---|--- 
 



\- 58 -  (6), Section 7.3, Section 8.3, Section 8.5 and Article 9 shall survive
any termination pursuant to Section 8.1; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | neither the termination of this Agreement nor, anything
contained in this Section 8.4(1) shall relieve any Party of any liability for
any breach of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 

Section 8.5 Expenses

Unless otherwise specified herein, all out-of-pocket third party transaction
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Plan of
Arrangement, including all costs, expenses and fees of the Company incurred
prior to or after the Effective Date in connection with, or incidental to, the
Plan of Arrangement, shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses,
whether or not the Arrangement is consummated.

 

Section 8.6 Waiver

 

No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver of any other provision (whether or not similar) or a
future waiver of the same provisions, nor, shall such waiver be binding unless
executed in writing by the Party to be bound by the waiver. No failure or
delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall
be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by
applicable laws.

Section 9.2 Injunctive Relief and Specific Performance

The Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur for which money damages
would not be an adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the Company or the
Purchaser in accordance with their

 



\- 61 -   specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
each Party shall be entitled to specific performance, an injunction or
injunctions and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of the provisions of this Agreement by the other Party or their
representatives or to otherwise obtain specific performance by the other Party
of any such provisions, any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other
equitable relief hereby being waived. Such remedies will not be the exclusive
remedies for any breach of this Agreement but will be in addition to all other
remedies available at law or equity to each of the Parties.

Section 9.3 Third Party Beneficiaries

 



   (1) | Except as provided in Section 7.1 and Section 2.4(6), and which,
without limiting their terms, are intended as stipulations for the benefit of
the third Persons mentioned in such provisions (such third Persons referred
to in this Section 9.3 as the "Indemnified Persons") and except for the rights
of the Shareholders and Optionholders to receive the Common Share
Consideration and Option Consideration following the Effective Time pursuant
to the Arrangement (for which purpose the Company hereby confirms that it is
acting as agent on behalf of the Shareholders and Optionholders), the Company
and the Purchaser intend that this Agreement will not benefit or create any
right or cause of action in favour of any Person, other than the Parties and
that no Person, other than the Parties, shall be entitled to rely on the
provisions of this Agreement in any action, suit, proceeding, hearing or
other forum. 
---|--- 



   (2) | Despite the foregoing, the Purchaser acknowledges to each of the
Indemnified Persons their direct rights against it under Section 7.1 and

benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her
heirs and his or her legal representatives, and for such purpose, the Company

such provisions on their behalf. The Parties reserve their right to vary or
rescind the rights at any time and in any way whatsoever, if any, granted by

or consent of that Person, including any Indemnified Person.

agreement between the Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated

understanding in entering into and completing the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



\- 62 -  Section 9.5 Successors and Assigns

Company and the Purchaser. After that time, it will be binding upon and enure
to the benefit of the Company, the Purchaser and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. 
---|--- 



   (2) | Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations under
this Agreement are assignable or transferable by any Party without the prior
written consent of the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Purchaser shall be entitled, without the consent of the Company, to assign any
of its rights or obligations under this Agreement to one or more affiliates of
the Purchaser, including the Acquiror, who agree to be bound by the
applicable covenants of the Purchaser contained herein and comply with the
applicable provisions of this Agreement and who deliver to the Company a duly
executed undertaking to such effect and confirming the accuracy of
all representations given by Purchaser pursuant to Schedule "E" to this
Agreement as if given by the Acquiror in the first instance, provided that any
such assignment shall not relieve the Purchaser of any of its obligations
hereunder, and provided further that if such assignment takes place, the
Purchaser shall continue to be fully liable as primary obligor, on a joint and
several basis with any such entity, to the Company for any default in
performance by the assignee of any of the Purchasers obligations hereunder. 
---|--- 

Section 9.6 Severability

 

If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable by an arbitrator or any court of competent jurisdiction, that
provision will be severed from this Agreement and the remaining provisions
shall remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

   (1) | This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted and enforced
in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the federal laws of
Canada applicable therein.

objection to the venue of any proceeding in such court or that such court
provides an inconvenient forum.

whatsoever to the Company under this Agreement or any other document

ARRANGEMENT

3.1 The Arrangement

The following events set out in this Section 3.1 shall occur and shall be
deemed to occur consecutively in the following order and beginning at the
Effective Time without any further authorization, act or formality:



     | (a) | All Options shall be transferred and surrendered by the
holders thereof to the Company in exchange for the Option Consideration for
each such Option. Each such Option surrendered and all option agreements
related thereto shall be cancelled and terminated and the holder thereof shall
thereafter only have the right to receive the consideration specified in
Section 5.1(d) (and, for greater certainty the Company shall be entitled to
withhold or deduct any amounts in accordance with Section 5.3). The Stock
Option Plan shall thereafter be terminated and be of no further force and
effect. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Simultaneously: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | each Share held by a Dissenting Shareholder shall be deemed
to be transferred by the holder thereof, without any further act or formality
on its part, free and clear of all Liens, to the Acquiror and thereupon such
holders name will be removed from the securities register of the Company in
respect of such Share, the Acquiror shall be entered in the securities
register of the Company as the holder thereof and shall be deemed to be the
legal and beneficial owner thereof, and at such time each Dissenting
Shareholder will have the rights set out in Section 4.1; and 
---|---|--- 
 



B-6  Acquiror pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i), shall be transferred to, and acquired
by the Acquiror, free and clear of any and all Liens, in exchange for the
Common Share Consideration (and, for greater certainty, the Acquiror or the
Depositary shall be entitled to withhold or deduct any amounts in accordance
with Section 5.3) and, in respect of each Share so acquired: 
---|---|--- 



     | (A) | each Former Shareholder, other than Dissenting Shareholders
in respect of Shares acquired by the Acquiror pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i),
shall cease to be the holder of such Share so exchanged concurrently with the
exchanges referred to in this Section 3.1(b)(ii) and such holders name shall
be removed from the securities register of the Company in respect of such
Share at such time; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | the Acquiror shall be deemed to be the legal and beneficial
owner of such Share (free and clear of any and all Liens) at the time of the
exchange pursuant to this Section 3.1(b)(ii) and shall be entered in the
securities register of the Company as the holder thereof. 
---|---|--- 

3.2 Adjustment of Consideration

If, on or after the date hereof, the Company declares, sets aside or pays any
dividend or other distribution payable in cash, securities, property or
otherwise to the holders of Shares prior to the Effective Date, or sets a
record date therefor that is prior to the Effective Date, then the Common
Share Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect such dividend or other
distribution by way of a reduction of the Common Share Consideration by an
amount equal to the value of such dividend or other distribution.

ARTICLE 4

RIGHTS OF DISSENT

 

4.1 Rights of Dissent

 

Registered holders of Shares may exercise, pursuant to and in the manner set
forth in Section 191 of the ABCA, the right of dissent in connection with the
Arrangement, as same may be modified by the Interim Order and this Section 4.1
("Dissent Rights"); provided that notwithstanding, (i) subsection 191(5) of
the ABCA, the written notice setting forth such registered holders objection
to the Arrangement Resolution referred to in subsection 191(5) of the ABCA
must be received by the Company not later than 5:00 p.m. (Calgary time) on the
Business Day which is two (2) Business Days immediately preceding the date of
the Company Meeting (as it may be adjourned or postponed from time to time);
and (ii) subsection 191(3) of the ABCA, the Acquiror and not the Company,
shall be required to pay the amount set out in Section 4.1(b). Registered
holders of Shares who duly and validly exercise such Dissent Rights shall have
a debt claim against the Acquiror for the amount set out in Section 4.1(a),
and all such holders who:

 



B-7  Shares, shall be entitled to be paid by the Acquiror in consideration for the
transfer of such Shares to the Acquiror as set out in Section 3.1(b)(i), the
fair value of such Shares (less any amounts which the Acquiror is entitled to
withdraw or deduct in accordance with Section 5.3), which fair value,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the ABCA, if permitted by the
Court, shall be determined as of the close of business on the day before the
Arrangement Resolution is adopted, and shall not be entitled to any other
payment or consideration, including any payment that would be payable under
the Arrangement had such holders not exercised their Dissent Rights in respect
of such Shares; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | ultimately are not, for any reason, entitled to be paid fair
value for such Shares, shall be deemed to have participated in the Arrangement
on the same basis as a non-dissenting holder of Shares as set out in Section
3.1(b)(ii). 
---|---|--- 

4.2 Recognition of Dissenting Shareholders 

For greater certainty, in no case shall the Purchaser, the Acquiror, the
Company or any other Person be required to recognize a Dissenting Shareholder
as a holder of Shares after the Effective Time and the names of such
Dissenting Shareholders shall be removed from the registers of holders of
Shares and the Acquiror shall be recorded as the holder of the Shares so
transferred and shall be deemed the legal and beneficial owner thereof free
and clear of all Liens. This Section 4.2 shall not modify or amend the rights
of Dissenting Shareholders as otherwise contemplated by this Plan of
Arrangement. In addition to any other restrictions under the ABCA, holders of
Options shall not be entitled to exercise Dissent Rights.

 

ARTICLE 5

CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENTS

5.1 Payment of Consideration

 



     | (a) | Prior to the filing of the Articles of Arrangement the
Purchaser shall deposit, or arrange to be deposited, for the benefit of
holders of Shares and for the benefit of holders of Options, cash with the
Depositary in the aggregate amount equal to the payments in respect thereof
required by this Plan of Arrangement, with the amount per Share in respect of
which Dissent Rights have been exercised being deemed to be the Common Share
Consideration for this purpose (less any amounts which Acquiror is entitled to
withdraw or deduct in accordance with Section 5.3), for the benefit of the
holders of Shares and Options. The cash deposited with the Depositary by or
on behalf of the Purchaser shall be held in an interest bearing account, and
any interest earned on such funds shall be for the account of the Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

Upon the surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares that
were transferred, or deemed to be transferred, pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(ii)
together with a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal and such 

---|---|--- 
 



B-8  reasonably require, the holder of the Shares represented by such surrendered
certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor from the
Depositary, and the Depositary shall deliver to such holder as soon as
practicable, a cheque (or other form of immediately available funds)
representing the Common Share Consideration which such holder has the right to
receive under the Arrangement for such Shares, less any amounts withheld or
deducted pursuant to Section 5.3, and any certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. 
---|--- 
 



     | (c) | Until surrendered for cancellation as contemplated by
Section 5.1(a), each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Shares shall be deemed after the time specified in Section 3.1(b)
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender a cash payment in
lieu of such certificate as contemplated in Section 3.1(b)(ii) or Section 4.1,
as the case may be, less any amounts withheld or deducted pursuant to Section
5.3. Any such certificate formerly representing Shares not duly surrendered on
or before the day prior to the third anniversary of the Effective Date shall
cease to represent a claim by or interest of any former holder of Shares of
any kind or nature against or in the Company or the Acquiror. On such date,
all cash to which such former holder was entitled shall be deemed to have been
surrendered to the Acquiror immediately prior to the application of any
applicable laws pertaining to unclaimed property then in effect including,
pursuant to the _Unclaimed Personal Property and Vested Property Act_
(Alberta), the _Unclaimed Property Act_ (British Columbia), the  _Public
Curator Act_ (Quebec) or other analogous legislation. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | On or as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, the
Depositary shall deliver, on behalf of the Company, to each Former
Optionholder in respect of his or her Options, a cheque (or other form of
immediately available funds) representing the Option Consideration, if any,
which such Former Optionholder is entitled to receive in connection with the
exchange described in Section 3.1(a), less any amounts withheld or deducted
pursuant to Section 5.3. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Any payment made by way of cheque by the Depositary on
behalf of the Company or the Acquiror pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement
that has not been deposited or has been returned to the Depositary or that
otherwise remains unclaimed, in each case, on the third anniversary of the
Effective Time, and any right or claim to payment hereunder that remains
outstanding on the third anniversary of the Effective Time, shall, and any
certificates, instruments or other documents previously evidencing ownership
of Shares or Options outstanding on such day, shall cease to represent a right
or claim of any kind or nature, and the right of the holder to receive
any consideration for the Shares or Options formerly held by such Person
pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement shall terminate and be deemed to be
surrendered and forfeited to the Acquiror for no consideration. 
---|---|--- 
 



B-9  consideration with respect to any Shares other than any cash payment which
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(b) or Section 4.1,
as applicable, and Section 5.1(b) and, for greater certainty, no such holder
will be entitled to receive any interest, dividends, premium or other payment
in connection therewith, other than any declared but unpaid dividends with a
record date prior to the Effective Date. No dividend or other distribution
declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to the Shares with a
record date on or after the Effective Date shall be delivered to the holder
of any unsurrendered certificate which, immediately prior to the Effective
Date, represented outstanding Shares. 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | Subject to the rights of Dissenting Shareholders set out in
this Plan of Arrangement, the right of each Former Shareholder and Former
Optionholder to receive cash payment under this Arrangement shall be
satisfied only out of the amounts deposited with the Depositary and payable by
the Depositary pursuant to this Article 4, and no such Former Shareholder or
Former Optionholder shall have any further right or claim as against the
Purchaser, the Acquiror or the Company or any of their respective successors. 
---|---|--- 

5.2 Lost Certificates 

In the event that any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented one or more outstanding Shares that were transferred
pursuant to Section 3.1(b) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, cash deliverable in accordance
with such holders Letter of Transmittal (including the certificate of loss).
When authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, the Person to whom such cash is to be delivered shall,
as a condition precedent to the delivery of such cash, give a bond
satisfactory to the Purchaser, the Acquiror and the Depositary (acting
reasonably) in such sum as the Purchaser may direct, or otherwise indemnify
the Purchaser, the Acquiror and the Company in a manner satisfactory to the
Purchaser, the Acquiror and the Company, acting reasonably, against any claim
that may be made against the Purchaser, the Acquiror and the Company with
respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

5.3 Withholding Rights

 

The Purchaser, the Acquiror, the Company or the Depositary, as applicable,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable to any
Person under this Plan of Arrangement (including without limitation any
payments pursuant to Section 4.1) such amounts as any of the Purchaser, the
Acquiror or the Company determines, acting reasonably, are required to
be deducted or withheld with respect to such payment under the Tax Act, the
United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any provision of any other
applicable law, in each case, as amended. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld or deducted and are remitted to the applicable Governmental
Authority, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Plan of Arrangement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made. 

 



B-10  5.4 Letter of Transmittal

At the time of mailing of the Company Circular or as soon as practicable
thereafter, the Company shall forward a Letter of Transmittal to each holder
of Shares at the address of such holder as it appears on the register
maintained by or on behalf of the Company in respect of the holders of Shares.

5.5 Tax Election

 

The Parties acknowledge that no deduction will be claimed by the Company in
respect of any payment made to a holder of Options in respect of the Options
pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement who is a resident of Canada or who is
employed in Canada (both within the meaning of the Tax Act), in computing the
Parties taxable income under the Tax Act, and the Company shall timely
elect in accordance with subsection 110(1.1) of the Tax Act in respect of all
Options acquired by the Company for cancellation under the Plan of Arrangement
and provide evidence in writing of such election to each Former Optionholder.
