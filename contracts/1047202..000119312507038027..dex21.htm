all cash and cash equivalents held by the Company on the Closing Date ("

and long-term certificates of deposit held by the Company, the amount of any
letters of credit (provided that such letter of credit is backed by a
restricted cash deposit with the issuing bank), and any security deposits made
by the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Person holding such

purposes of this Agreement (" _Cash and Cash Equivalents_ "), and (ii) (A)

(b) On the Closing Date, the Base Consideration shall be increased, if
applicable, by an amount equal to the Estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents,
and decreased, if applicable, by an amount equal to the amount by which the
Estimated Net Assets at Closing are less than the Target Net Assets. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event will the Base Consideration be increased if
the Estimated Net Assets exceed the Target Net Assets. The Aggregate Merger
Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to this Section 3.3(b), is referred to
herein as the " _Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration_ ").

(c) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the
Representative, as soon as reasonably practicable but in no event later
than ninety (90) days  



 

13  following the Closing Date, a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ "),
together with all supporting documentation or information as
the Representative shall reasonably request, setting forth, in reasonable
detail, Parents calculation of (i) (A) the Cash and Cash Equivalents of the
Company as of the Closing Date (" _Final Cash and Cash Equivalents_ ")
and (B) the amount by which the Final Cash and Cash Equivalents exceed or are
less than, as applicable, the Estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents and (ii) (A)
the Net Assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as
of the Closing Date (the " _Final Net Assets_ ") prepared in accordance with
the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Accounting
Principles and (B) the amount by which the Final Net Assets exceed or are
less than, as applicable, the Estimated Net Assets.

(d) The Representative shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the
Closing Statement (the " _Objection Period_ ") to review the Closing
Statement. Parent shall grant the Representative access at reasonable times
and places and upon reasonable advance notice to all books, records and
employees of the Surviving Corporation as reasonably requested by the
Representative in connection with his review of the Closing Statement. Upon
the expiration of the Objection Period, the Representative, on behalf of all
stockholders of the Company, shall be deemed to have accepted, and shall be
bound by, the Closing Statement and the calculation therein of the Final Cash
and Cash Equivalents and the Final Net Assets, unless the Representative shall
have informed Parent in writing of its disagreement with the
Closing Statement prior to the expiration of the Objection Period (the "
_Objection_ "), specifying each disputed item and setting forth in reasonable
detail the basis for each such dispute (each, a " _Disputed Item_ ").
Parent shall have thirty (30) days from the date on which it receives the
Objection (the date on which such thirty (30) day period ends, the " _Response
Date_ ") to review and respond to such Objection. If Parent and
the Representative are able to negotiate a mutually agreeable resolution of
each Disputed Item, and each signs a certificate to that effect, the Closing
Statement and the calculation therein of the Final Cash and Cash Equivalents
and the Final Net Assets, as adjusted to reflect such resolution, shall be
deemed final, non-appealable and binding for purposes of this Agreement. If
any Disputed Items have not been resolved by the Response Date, either Parent
or the Representative may refer such Disputed Items to an independent,
mutually agreeable, nationally recognized public accounting firm (the "
_Accounting Referee_ ") who shall accept its appointment within seven (7) days
after such referral, to make a final, non-appealable and binding
determination as to such remaining Disputed Items pursuant to the terms
hereof. The Accounting Referee shall be directed to make a determination in
accordance with Section 3.3(e) below of the Disputed Items promptly, but no
later than sixty (60) days, after acceptance of its appointment. Parent and
the Representative agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to
effect the selection and appointment of the Accounting Referee pursuant to
this Section 3.3(d), including executing an engagement agreement with the
Accounting Referee providing for reasonable and customary compensation and
other terms of such engagement. Parent and the Representative shall make
readily available to the Accounting Referee all relevant books, records and
employees of the Company and the Surviving Corporation that are reasonably
requested by the Accounting Referee in connection with the Accounting
Referees review of any Disputed Items;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent, the Representative and their Affiliates shall not be obligated to
provide any information the disclosure of which would jeopardize any privilege
available to such Person relating to such information or which would cause
such Person to breach a confidentiality obligation to which it is bound;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however,_ that Parent, the Representative and their
Affiliates shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the
effects of any such limitations.



 

14 (e) If Disputed Items are referred to the Accounting Referee for resolution
pursuant to Section 3.3(d) above, the Accounting Referee shall determine only
with respect to the Disputed Items submitted whether and to what extent, if
any, the Final Cash and Cash Equivalents and the Final Net Assets set forth in
the Closing Statement require adjustment. Any finding by the Accounting
Referee shall be a reasoned award stating in reasonable detail the findings of
fact on which it is based, shall be final, non-appealable and binding upon the
Parties and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy between the Parties
regarding the Disputed Items so presented. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Referee shall be borne by Parent and the Escrowed Holders (as
defined below) in the same proportion that the dollar amount of Disputed
Items which are not resolved in favor of Parent or the Escrowed Holders, as
applicable, bears to the total dollar amount of Disputed Items resolved by the
Accounting Referee. Each of Parent and the Escrowed Holders shall bear the
fees, costs and expenses of its own accountants and all of its other expenses
incurred in connection with matters contemplated by this Section 3.3.

(f) Payment of the Adjustments.

(i) Payment of the adjustments as contemplated by this Section 3.3(f)
shall be made (A) if no Objection is made by the Representative during the
Objection Period, within five (5) Business Days following the expiration of
the Objection Period or (B) if the Representative submits an Objection within
the Objection Period, within five (5) Business Days following final
resolution of all Disputed Items by either Parent and the Representative or
the Accounting Referee.

(ii) If the Final Cash and Cash Equivalents exceed the Estimated Cash and Cash
Equivalents, Parent shall promptly deliver, or cause to be delivered, an
amount in cash equal to such excess to the Exchange Agent (as defined below)
for payment to the Escrowed Holders in accordance with the Exchange Agent
Agreement (as defined below). Any such amounts shall be promptly distributed
to the Escrowed Holders in accordance with each such holders Pro Rata Share
(as defined below).

(iii) If the Final Cash and Cash Equivalents are less than the Estimated Cash
and Cash Equivalents, Parent shall recover from the Escrow Fund (as defined
below) the amount of such difference in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 

(iv) If the Final Net Assets exceed the Estimated Net Assets and the Aggregate
Merger Consideration was decreased at Closing because the Estimated Net
Assets were less than the Target Net Assets, Parent shall promptly deliver, or
cause to be delivered, an amount in cash equal to such excess to the Exchange
Agent for payment to the Escrowed Holders in accordance with the
Exchange Agent Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
sum of the Estimated Net Assets and the payment contemplated by this Section
3.3(f)(iv) exceed the Target Net Assets. Any such amounts shall be promptly
distributed to the Escrowed Holders in accordance with each such holders Pro
Rata Share.



 

15 (v) If the Final Net Assets are less than the Estimated Net Assets and the
Target Net Assets, Parent shall recover from the Escrow Fund the amount of
such difference between the Final Net Assets and the Estimated Net Assets in

option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stock
Options_ ") that is unexercised, unexpired and then outstanding shall become

Stock subject thereto. Such Company Stock Options shall be cancelled as of the
Effective Time and each holder thereof (each, an " _Optionholder_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the consideration payable in respect thereof, as set forth in this Section
3.5. At the Effective Time and on the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, each Optionholder shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company, be entitled to
receive a portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration equal to (a) the per
share consideration allocated to each share of Company Common Stock, as
determined pursuant to _Schedule 3.1(b)_ hereto, multiplied by the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to all Company Stock Options
held by such Optionholder, less (b) the aggregate cash exercise price payable
upon exercise of all Company Stock Options held by such Optionholder. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall make any amendments to the terms of the

in each case, are necessary to effect the treatment of the Company Stock

and the Optionholders, cash in an aggregate amount sufficient to pay the
Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration, less the Escrow Amount to be
deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the  



 

16  provisions of Article X (the " _Exchange_ _Fund_ "). From time to time after
the Closing Date, Parent shall promptly deposit with the Exchange Agent such
amounts, if any, either directly or from the Escrow Fund, to be added to the
Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund in an insured
deposit account, as directed by Parent, and any interest or other earnings
with respect thereto shall be paid to Parent as and when requested by Parent.

3.7 _Exchange Procedures_.

(a) Subject to the receipt by Parent prior to the Effective Time of all
information reasonably requested by Parent, immediately following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail (i) to each holder of a certificate or certificates which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital
Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") (A) a letter of transmittal, in customary form
prepared by Parent and delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time,
which shall specify that delivery shall be effective, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent, and that the holders are agreeing to appoint the
Representative upon the terms set forth in Section 10.3 of this Agreement, and
(B) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange

as applicable, and/or a letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, to the Exchange Agent, together with
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
each stockholder and Optionholder delivering such documents shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor its respective portion of the Estimated
Aggregate Merger Consideration, less the portion of the Estimated Aggregate
Merger Consideration allocable to such stockholder or Optionholder that has
been deposited in the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 10.2.

(b) No interest will be paid or will accrue for the benefit of Company
stockholders or Optionholders on any Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration
and any other amounts payable under this Article III. All payments of the
Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable under

the Certificate representing such shares of Company Capital Stock is presented
to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid, each in the sole and reasonable discretion of the Exchange
Agent.

remains undistributed to the stockholders of the Company and the
Optionholders on the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any stockholder of the
Company or any Optionholder who has not theretofore complied with this
Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent for its respective portion of
the Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable
under this Article III with respect to the Company Capital Stock or
Company Stock Options formerly represented thereby to which such stockholder
or Optionholder, as applicable, is entitled pursuant to this Article III, and
Parent shall, upon the request of any such former stockholder of the Company
or former Optionholder, promptly pay to such former stockholder or former
Optionholder the portion of the Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration to
which he, she or it is entitled, less the portion of the Estimated Aggregate
Merger Consideration allocable to such stockholder or Optionholder that has
been deposited in the Escrow Fund. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by former stockholders of the Company or former
Optionholders on the date that is five (5) years after the Effective Time (or
such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority pursuant
to applicable Law) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Representative or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any Estimated Aggregate Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable under this Article III from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to and in full
compliance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
applicable Law.

3.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. As of the
Effective Time, all Certificates representing Company Capital Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each stockholder of the Company shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such stockholders Certificates, except for the right to
receive its respective portion of the Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration
and any other amounts payable under this Article III upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with Section 3.7 (other than Certificates
representing Company Capital Stock to be cancelled in accordance with Section
3.1(c) and for Dissenting Shares).

3.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable under this Article III with respect to the Company Capital
Stock formerly represented thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may,
in its sole discretion, require the Person who is the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate to (a) provide an indemnification agreement,
in form and substance acceptable to Parent, against any claim that may be made
against Parent with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed and/or (b) post a bond in such reasonable amount and for
such reasonable period of time as Parent may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such Certificate; _provided_ , that Parent shall only be entitled
to enforce this clause (b) against Persons owning Certificates representing
the right to receive at least $1,000,000 of the Estimated Aggregate Merger
Consideration.



 

18 3.11 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Estimated
Aggregate Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable under this
Article III or otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or under any
applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the stockholder of the Company in respect to which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be.

3.12 _Stock Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Company Capital Stock thereafter on the records
of the Company.

3.13 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest Parent with control over, and to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to, all
assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall, in
the name of their respective corporations or otherwise, be fully authorized
to take all such lawful and necessary action.

3.14 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held
by persons who have exercised and perfected appraisal rights for such shares
of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") and as of the Effective Time have neither effectively
withdrawn nor lost any right to such appraisal, shall not be converted into or
represent a right to receive the Estimated Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable under this Article III attributable to such Dissenting Shares.
Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value
of such shares of Company Common Stock held by them in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless and until such stockholders fail to
perfect, effectively withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal rights under
the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any dissenting stockholder shall
effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the
right to appraisal, then as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such
event, whichever occurs later, such Dissenting Shares shall automatically be
converted into and represent only the right to receive the Estimated Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable under this Article III, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates
representing such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 3.7. The
Company shall provide Parent (a) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal or payment of the fair value of any shares of Company Capital Stock,
the withdrawal of such demands and any other related instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company, and (b) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL.

Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide to Parent  



 

49  executed resolutions by the board of directors of the Company authorizing
the termination of the 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which

each Continuing Employee as if such service had been performed with Parent (i)

purposes under Parents severance plan. With respect to any welfare plan
maintained by Parent in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate
after the Effective Time, subject to applicable Law and the terms and
conditions of such plan, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and
exclusions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable
to such employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied
or did not apply to such employees under the welfare plans maintained by the
Company prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Any Continuing Employee who is terminated after the Closing Date will be
entitled to receive severance under Parents standard severance plan;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the cost of any severance or other payments to
any Person listed on _Schedule 7.6(d)_ hereto in the event any such Person is

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne by the Company;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that in the event Parent or the
Surviving Corporation processes any such payments to such Persons following
the Closing Date, the aggregate amount of such payments shall be accounted for
in accordance with the Accounting Principles. In no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be obligated to pay or be responsible for severance to
any employee of the Company terminated on or prior to the Closing Date.

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, the Companys directors and officers (the " _Covered Parties_ ") set
forth on _Schedule 7.7(a)_ , in the event any of the Covered Parties are made
or threatened to be made a party to an action or Legal Proceeding, whether
criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that
such Covered Party was a director or officer of the Company. In addition, for
a period of six (6) 



 

50  years following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation to contain provisions with respect to indemnification and
exculpation that are at least as favorable as the indemnification and
exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Company as of the date of this Agreement, and, during such six-
year period, Parent shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving Corporation
to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify any of such provisions, except as
required by Law.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the Companys
existing policy of directors and officers and fiduciary liability insurance
(the " _D andO Policy_") covering claims arising from facts or events that
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions
occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent that such acts or omissions
are covered by the DandO Policy); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess of
200% of the current aggregate annual premium (the " _Maximum Premium_ ");
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that if the annual premium of such
insurance coverage exceeds such amount, then Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage then available
for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor a policy of at
least the same coverage and amount containing terms and conditions that are no
less advantageous than the DandO Policy, and which coverage and amount shall be
no less than the coverage and amount provided at that time for the Surviving
Corporations directors and officers. Prior to the Effective Time,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may,
after consultation with Parent, purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on
the DandO Policy on terms and conditions no more advantageous than the DandO
Policy. In the event that the Company purchases such a "tail" policy prior to
the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such
"tail" policy in full force and effect and shall honor their respective

Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this Section 7.7(b), until

one another to comply promptly with all governmental requirements applicable
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to obtain promptly all
approvals, Orders, Permits or other consents of any applicable Governmental
Authorities required pursuant to applicable Law or necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the

the other parties and, upon request, to any Governmental Authorities such
information and assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with
the foregoing, including by responding promptly to and complying with any

by Parent of written notice of such breach, or (ii) any permanent injunction
or other Order of a court or other competent authority preventing the
consummation of the Merger shall have become final and nonappealable.

9.2 _Procedure Upon Termination_. In the event of termination and abandonment
by Parent or the Company, or both, pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof, written
notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party or parties setting
forth a reasonably detailed description of the basis on which such party is
terminating this Agreement, and this Agreement shall terminate without
further action by Parent or the Company.

9.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated as provided herein, each of the parties shall be relieved of their
duties and obligations arising under this Agreement after the date of such
termination and such termination shall be without liability to Parent,
the Company or their respective officers, directors, stockholders or
affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations of the parties set
forth in this Article IX, Article XI hereof and the Non-Disclosure Agreement
shall survive any such termination and shall be enforceable hereunder;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 9.3 shall
relieve Parent or the Company of any Liability for a breach of this Agreement
prior to the effective date of termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent and the Company agree that for a period of twelve (12) months
immediately following such termination, neither Parent nor the Company, as
applicable, shall directly or indirectly solicit, induce, recruit or
encourage any individuals to leave the Companys or Parents, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, employ for any reason or interfere in
any other manner with the employment relationships at the time existing
between the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and its current employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a)
general advertising or solicitation by general media, the Internet or other
general recruiting means and participation at job fairs and recruiting
workshops by either party and (b) soliciting, inducing, recruiting or
encouraging any individuals who contact either party on their own initiative,
in each case, shall not be deemed a violation of this Section 9.3.

COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS; INDEMNIFICATION

10.1 _General Survival_. The representations and warranties of the Company
contained in this Agreement and the certificate to be delivered by the
Company pursuant to Section 8.3(c) (the " _Closing Certificate_ ") shall
survive the Merger and continue until the date that is two (2) years from the
Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Section 4.10 (Taxes) shall survive the
Closing until the  



 

57  date that is seven (7) years from the Effective Time (in each case, the "
_Survival Period_ "); _provided_ , _further_ ,  _however_ , that if any bona
fide Indemnification Claims (as defined below) have been asserted in
accordance with this Article X and the Escrow Agreement prior to the
termination of the applicable Survival Period, such claims shall continue
in effect until final resolution of such claims. The covenants and agreements
of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement that by
their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the
Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time.

10.2 _Indemnification_.

(a) _Indemnity_. Subject to Sections 10.1, 10.2(c) and 10.5, from and after
the Effective Time and until the termination of the applicable Survival
Period, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation and their respective
affiliates, officers, directors, stockholders, representatives and agents
(collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ "), shall be indemnified and held harmless
(on a several (but not joint) basis) by each holder of Company Capital Stock
who does not perfect its appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL,
each dissenting stockholder who withdraws or otherwise terminates its
appraisal rights pursuant to the DGCL and each Optionholder (collectively, "
_Escrowed Holders_ "), from and to the extent of such Escrowed Holders
proportionate interest in the Escrow Fund, from and against and in respect of
all Losses resulting from, arising out of, relating to, imposed upon
or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any other
Indemnitee by reason of:

(i) the failure of any representation or warranty of the Company in this
Agreement or the Closing Certificate to be true, correct and complete on the
date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of the
Closing Date, except that any such representations and warranties which by
their express terms are made solely as of a specified earlier date shall be
true, correct and complete only as of such specified earlier date, in each
case, determined without giving effect to any Material Adverse Effect or
materiality qualifications contained in such representations and warranties;

(ii) any breach or failure by the Company to perform any of the covenants or
agreements of the Company contained in this Agreement that are to be performed
prior to the Effective Time;

(iii) any claims arising out of, related to, or in connection with the
exercise of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL; 

(iv) any amounts recoverable by Parent under Section 3.3(f);

(v) any fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee payable under Section
3.3(d); and

(vi) the termination of the Contract set forth on _Schedule 7.14_ at or prior
to the Effective Time or, in the event such Contract is not terminated at or
prior to the Effective Time, any claims arising out of, related to, or in
connection with the termination of the Contract set forth on _Schedule 7.14_
following the Effective Time.



 

58 (b) _Escrow Fund_. To provide a fund against which an Indemnitee may assert
claims of indemnification pursuant to this Agreement (an " _Indemnification
Claim_ "), at Closing Parent shall deposit $30,000,000 of the Estimated
Aggregate Merger Consideration (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") into an interest-
bearing escrow account (the " _Escrow Fund_ "). The Escrow Amount, and
interest and other earnings payable thereon, shall be held and distributed in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement. Parent shall be the owner of the Escrow
Fund for tax purposes, and all parties will file all Tax Returns consistent
with such treatment unless otherwise required by Law. All distributions made
to the Escrowed Holders out of the Escrow Fund shall be based on such
stockholders proportionate interest in the Final Aggregate Merger
Consideration it is entitled to receive pursuant to Article III (" _Pro Rata
Share_ "). Subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, up to $10,000,000 of the Escrow Amount shall be released from the
Escrow Fund on the date that is one (1) year following the Closing Date, with
up to an additional $10,000,000 of the Escrow Amount to be released from the
Escrow Fund on the date that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing
Date and the remaining $10,000,000 of the Escrow Amount to be released from
the Escrow Fund on the date that is two (2) years following the Closing Date.

(c) _Limitations_.

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Escrowed Holders shall not be required to make any indemnification payment
pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i) until such time as the total amount of all
Losses that have been suffered or incurred by the Indemnitees pursuant to
Section 10.2(a)(i), other than Losses attributable to any breach of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Sections 4.1
(Organization and Good Standing), 4.2 (Authorization of Agreement), 4.4
(Capitalization), 4.5 (Subsidiaries; Investments), 4.10 (Taxes) or 4.27
(Financial Advisors), exceeds $625,000, and, in such event, the Escrowed
Holders shall be required to pay the entire amount of such Losses (after
deducting therefrom an amount equal to $250,000).

(ii) The total amount of Losses which the Escrowed Holders shall be obligated
to pay to the Indemnitees under Section 10.2(a) shall not exceed the Escrow
Fund and the amount of Losses each Escrowed Holder shall be obligated to pay
the Indemnitees under Section 10.2(a) shall not exceed its, his or her Pro
Rata Share of such Losses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate
liability of any Escrowed Holder for any Indemnification Claim involving fraud
or intentional misrepresentation or omissions on the part of the Company, or
any Indemnification Claim resulting from a breach of the Tax representations
and warranties contained in Section 4.10 of this Agreement, shall not be
limited to the Escrow Fund; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in no event shall
any Escrowed Holder be liable for Losses attributable to any breach of the
Tax representations contained in Section 4.10 of this Agreement in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) of its, his or her Pro Rata Share of such Losses,
and an Escrowed Holders aggregate liability in respect of such Losses shall
not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of its, his or her respective portion of
the Final Aggregate Merger Consideration; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ ,
that the amount of Losses each Escrowed Holder shall be obligated to pay the
Indemnitees for any Indemnification Claim attributable to fraud or intentional
misrepresentation or omissions on the part of the Company shall not exceed  



 

59  its, his or her Pro Rata Share of such Losses and an Escrowed Holders
aggregate liability in respect of such Losses shall not exceed the portion of
the Final Aggregate Merger Consideration received by such Escrowed Holder.

(iii) An Indemnitees right to indemnification under this Article X based on
the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant or based on the failure
of such representation or warranty to be true, correct and complete as of the
date hereof or the Closing Date shall not be diminished or otherwise affected
in any way as a result of the existence of such Indemnitees Knowledge of such
breach or untruth as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date, regardless
of whether such Knowledge exists as a result of the Indemnitees
investigation or as a result of disclosure by the Company (or any other
Person), unless such disclosures were set forth in this Agreement or in any
applicable schedules hereto.

(iv) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recovery from the Escrowed Holders
for any exemplary, special, indirect or consequential Losses or damages of any
kind whatsoever (including lost profits and diminution in value).

(v) The amount of Losses recoverable by any Indemnitee under this Agreement
with respect to an indemnity claim shall be reduced by (A) the amount of any
payment actually received by such Indemnitee from any insurance policy net of
any deductibles or other amounts payable with respect thereto, and (B) the
amount of any net Tax benefits actually received by the Indemnitee, in each
case, in the year the indemnification payment is made or in any prior year,
resulting from the incurrence or payment of such Losses.

(d) _Manner of Indemnification_. Each Indemnification Claim shall be made only
in accordance with this Article X and the Escrow Agreement.

10.3 _Representative_. For purposes of this Agreement, the Escrowed Holders,
without any further action on the part of any such Escrowed Holder, shall be
deemed to have consented to the appointment of Jason Nevader (or, if Jason
Nevader is offered and accepts a full-time management position with Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, David Bohnett shall
become the Representative automatically and without any further action on the
part of the Escrowed Holders) as the Representative of such Escrowed Holders,
as the attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of each such Escrowed Holder, and
the taking by the Representative of any and all actions and the making of any
decisions required or permitted to be taken by him under this Agreement,
including the exercise of the power to (a) execute this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, (b) authorize delivery to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation of the Escrow Fund, or any portion thereof, in satisfaction of
Indemnification Claims, (c) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators
with respect to such Indemnification Claims, (d) resolve any Indemnification
Claims, and (e) take all actions necessary in the judgment of the
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing and all of the other
terms, conditions and limitations of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
Accordingly, the Representative has unlimited authority and power to act on
behalf of each Escrowed Holder with respect to this  



 

60  Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the disposition, settlement or other
handling of all Indemnification Claims, rights or obligations arising from
and taken pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The Escrowed
Holders will be bound by all actions taken by the Representative in connection
with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to rely on any action or decision of the
Representative. The Representative will incur no liability with respect to any
action taken or suffered by him in reliance upon any notice, direction,
instruction, consent, statement or other document believed by him to be
genuine and to have been signed by the proper person (and shall have no
responsibility to determine the authenticity thereof), nor for any other
action or inaction, except his own willful misconduct, bad faith or
gross negligence. In all questions arising under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, the Representative may rely on the advice of counsel, and the
Representative will not be liable to Escrowed Holders for anything done,
omitted or suffered in good faith by the Representative based on such advice.
Subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, up to
$250,000 of the reasonable expenses of the Representative shall be paid from
the Escrow Fund on an as incurred basis. The Representative will not be
required to take any action involving any expense unless the payment of such
expense is made or provided for in a manner satisfactory to him. At any time
during the term of the Escrow Agreement, Escrowed Holders entitled to a
majority in interest of the Escrow Amount can appoint a new Representative by
written consent by sending notice and a copy of the duly executed written
consent appointing such new Representative to Parent and the Escrow Agent.
Such appointment will be effective upon the later of the date indicated in
the consent or the date such consent is received by Parent, Merger Sub (or, if
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) and the Escrow Agent.

10.4 _Third Party Claims_. If Parent becomes aware of a third-party claim that
Parent believes, in good faith, may result in an Indemnification Claim,
Parent shall notify the Representative of such claim, and shall conduct the
defense of such claim. The Representative, as representative for the Escrowed
Holders, shall be entitled to participate in any such defense. The reasonable
costs of the defense of any third-party action or claim incurred by the
Representative shall be paid by the Escrowed Holders. Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall conduct such defense, but shall
not settle any such claim without the consent of the Representative, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
consent of the Representative is so obtained, such settlement of that portion
of any such claim shall alone be determinative of the amount of the claim
against the Escrow Amount, and neither the Representative nor any person who
has a beneficial interest in the Escrow Amount shall have any power or
authority to object under any provision of this Article X to the amount of
any demand by Parent against the Escrow Amount with respect to such
settlement.

10.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this
Article X, the Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Indemnitees from and after the Effective Time for any Indemnification Claims
arising under this Agreement, including claims of breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that the foregoing clause of this sentence shall not be deemed a waiver by
any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief, or any
right or remedy arising by reason of any (a) fraud or willful
misrepresentation with the respect to this Agreement or the Closing
Certificate and (b) litigation or other claims related to the exercise of
appraisal or similar rights  



 

61  by any holders of outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock who hold such
shares as of, or prior to, the Closing Date. The obligations of the
Escrowed Holders of the Company under this Article X shall not be reduced,
offset, eliminated or subject to contribution by reason of any action or
inaction by the Company that contributed to any inaccuracy or breach given
rise to such obligation, it being understood that the Escrowed Holders, not
the Company, shall have the sole obligation for the indemnification
obligations under this Article X.

ARTICLE XI

MISCELLANEOUS

11.1 _Specific Performance_. The rights and remedies of the parties hereto
shall be cumulative (and not alternative). The parties hereto agree that (a)
in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any party of any covenant,
obligation, or other provision of this Agreement applicable to such party, the
other parties shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be
available) to seek (i) a decree or order of specific performance or mandamus
to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant, obligation or
other provision, and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened
breach, and (b) neither such other parties shall be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such decree, order or
injunction or in connection with any related action or proceeding.

11.2 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process; Waiver of
Jury Trial_.

(a) Each of the parties hereto agrees that any legal action or proceeding
with respect to this Agreement may be brought in the Chancery Court of the
State of Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware and,
by execution and delivery of this Agreement, each party hereto irrevocably
submits itself in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts in any legal action or
proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement brought in
the courts referred to in the proceeding sentence. Each party hereby consents
to process being served in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of a
copy thereof to the address set forth in Section 11.5 hereof and agrees that
such service upon receipt shall constitute good and sufficient service of
process or notice thereof. Nothing in this Section 11.2 shall affect or
eliminate any right to serve process in any other matter permitted by law.

(b) The Company and Parent each hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any right to trial by jury of any claim, demand, action or
cause of action (i) arising under this Agreement or (ii) in any way connected
with or related or incidental to the dealings of the parties in respect of
this Agreement or any of the transactions related hereto, in each case,
whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether in tort, contract,
equity or otherwise. The Company and Parent each hereby agree and consent that
any such claim, demand, action or cause of action shall be decided by court
trial without a jury and that any party may file an original counterpart of a
copy of this Agreement with any court as written evidence of the consent of
the parties to the waiver of their right to trial by jury.



 

62 11.3 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents (including the schedules and exhibits hereto and the
Non-Disclosure Agreement) represent the entire understanding and agreement
between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and can be amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof
or thereof can be waived, only by written instrument making specific reference
to this Agreement or such other Transaction Document, as applicable, signed by
the party against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document, including any investigation by or on behalf
of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking
such action of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any
provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or
continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach. No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or
remedy by such party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

11.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement, the exhibits and
schedules hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the documents and
instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto referenced herein
are not intended to, and shall not, confer upon any other person any rights
or remedies hereunder, except the rights granted to the Covered Parties under
Section 7.7 and the rights granted to the Indemnitees under Article X.

11.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and
interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable
to contracts made and performed in such state without reference to such
states principles of conflicts-of-law.

11.6  _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (a) when delivered personally by
hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (b) when sent by facsimile (with
