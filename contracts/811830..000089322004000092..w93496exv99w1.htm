all rulings (other than determination letters) and most recent determination
letters and any pending request for a determination letter pertaining to any
such plans. Neither Seacoast, any Seacoast Subsidiary, nor any employee
benefit pension plan (as defined in ERISA Section&nbsp;3(2)) maintained by Seacoast
or any Seacoast Subsidiary, has incurred, directly or indirectly, within the
past six (6)&nbsp;years any liability under Title IV of ERISA (including any
liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) or to the IRS with
respect to any employee benefit pension plan qualified under IRC Section 401(a)
which liability has resulted in or will result in a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to Seacoast, except liabilities to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation pursuant to ERISA Section&nbsp;4007, all of which have been fully paid,
nor has any reportable event under ERISA Section&nbsp;4043 occurred with respect to
any such pension plan which would result in a Material Adverse Effect. With
respect to each of such plans that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, the present
value of the accrued benefits under such plans, calculated on a plan
termination basis (using appropriate or required annuity purchase rates and
lump-sum distribution assumptions), based on the plan&#146;s most recent valuation
date and determined as of such date, did not exceed the then current value of
the assets of such plan allocable to such accrued benefits. Neither Seacoast
nor any Seacoast Subsidiary has incurred or is subject to any liability under
ERISA Section&nbsp;4201 for a complete or partial withdrawal from a multiemployer
plan. All &#147;employee benefit plans,&#148; as defined in ERISA Section&nbsp;3(3), comply
and within the past six (6)&nbsp;years have complied in all material respects with
(i)&nbsp;relevant provisions of ERISA and (ii)&nbsp;in the case of plans intended to
qualify for favorable income tax treatment, provisions of the IRC relevant to
such treatment. No prohibited transaction (which shall mean any transaction
prohibited by ERISA Section&nbsp;406 and not exempt under ERISA Section&nbsp;408 or any
transaction prohibited under IRC Section&nbsp;4975) has occurred within the past six
(6)&nbsp;years with respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Seacoast or
any Seacoast Subsidiary which would result in the imposition, directly or
indirectly, of an excise tax under IRC Section&nbsp;4975 or other penalty under
ERISA or the IRC, which, individually or in the aggregate, has resulted in or
will result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Seacoast. Seacoast
and the Seacoast Subsidiaries provide continuation coverage under group health
plans for separating employees and &#147;qualified beneficiaries&#148; in material
compliance with the provisions of IRC Section&nbsp;4980B(f). Such group health
plans are in material compliance with Section&nbsp;1862(b)(1) of the Social Security
Act and the applicable provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, as amended.

true and complete copies of the employee pension benefit plans within the
meaning of ERISA Section&nbsp;3(2), profit sharing plans, employee stock ownership
plans, stock purchase plans, deferred compensation and supplemental income
plans, supplemental executive retirement plans, annual incentive plans, group
insurance plans, and all other employee welfare benefit plans within the
meaning of ERISA Section&nbsp;3(1) (including vacation pay, sick leave, short-term
disability, long-term disability, and medical plans), and all other employee
benefit plans, policies, agreements and arrangements, all of which are set
forth on the Sovereign Disclosure Schedule, sponsored or contributed to for the
benefit of the employees or former employees (including retired employees) and
any beneficiaries thereof or directors or former directors of Sovereign or any
Sovereign Subsidiary, together with (i)&nbsp;the most recent actuarial (if any) and
financial reports relating to those plans which constitute &#147;qualified plans&#148;
under IRC Section&nbsp;401(a), (ii)&nbsp;the most recent annual reports relating to such
plans filed by them, respectively, with any government agency, and (iii)&nbsp;all
rulings and determination letters which pertain to any such plans. Neither
Sovereign, any Sovereign Subsidiary, nor any pension plan maintained by
Sovereign or any Sovereign Subsidiary, has incurred, directly or indirectly,
within the past six (6)&nbsp;years any liability under Title IV of ERISA (including
to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) or to the IRS with respect to any
pension plan qualified under IRC Section 401(a) which liability has resulted in
or will result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Sovereign, except
liabilities to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation pursuant to ERISA
Section&nbsp;4007, all of which have been fully paid, nor has any reportable event
under ERISA Section&nbsp;4043 occurred with respect to any such pension plan which
would result in a Material Adverse Effect. With respect to each of such plans
that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, the present value of the accrued benefits
under such plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes
in the plan&#146;s most recent actuarial report did not, as of its latest valuation
date, exceed the then current value of the assets of such plan allocable to
such accrued benefits. Neither Sovereign nor any Sovereign Subsidiary has
incurred or is subject to any liability under ERISA Section&nbsp;4201 for a complete
or partial withdrawal from a multiemployer plan. All &#147;employee benefit plans,&#148;
as defined in ERISA Section&nbsp;3(3), comply and within the past six (6)&nbsp;years have
complied in all material respects with (i)&nbsp;relevant provisions of ERISA, and
(ii)&nbsp;in the case of plans intended to qualify for favorable income tax
treatment, provisions of the IRC relevant to such treatment. No prohibited
transaction (which shall mean any transaction prohibited by ERISA Section&nbsp;406
and not exempt under ERISA Section&nbsp;408 or any transaction prohibited under IRC
Section&nbsp;4975) has occurred within the past six (6)&nbsp;years with respect to any
employee benefit plan maintained by Sovereign or any Sovereign Subsidiary that
would result in the imposition, directly or indirectly, of an excise tax under
IRC Section&nbsp;4975 or other penalty under ERISA or the IRC, which individually or
in the aggregate, has resulted in or will result in a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to Sovereign. Sovereign and the Sovereign Subsidiaries provide
continuation coverage under group health plans for separating employees and
&#147;qualified beneficiaries&#148; in accordance with the provisions of IRC Section
4980B(f). Such group health plans are in compliance with Section&nbsp;1862(b)(1) of
the Social Security Act and the applicable provisions of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Agrees to be present (in person or by proxy) at all meetings of
stockholders of Seacoast called to vote for approval of the Agreement and the
Merger so that all shares of common stock of Seacoast then owned by the
undersigned or over which the undersigned exercises voting control
(collectively, &#147;Shares&#148;) will be counted for the purpose of determining the
presence of a quorum at such meetings, and agrees to vote or cause to be voted
all such Shares, to the extent that such Shares are entitled to vote on such
matters, (i)&nbsp;in favor of approval and adoption of the Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby (including any amendments or modifications of

against approval or adoption of any other merger, business combination,

terms of this Letter Agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to Sovereign;

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;Agrees not to offer, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any
shares of common stock of Sovereign received in the Merger, except (i)&nbsp;at such
time as a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended

and a prospectus is made available under the Securities Act, (ii)&nbsp;within the
limits, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of, Rule 145(d) under
the Securities Act (as such rule may be hereafter amended), or (iii)&nbsp;in a
transaction which, in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to Sovereign or as
described in a &#147;no-action&#148; or interpretive letter from the staff of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (a &#147;No-Action Correspondence&#148;), is not
required to be registered under the Securities Act; and acknowledges and agrees
that Sovereign is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other
disposition of Sovereign common stock by the undersigned or on behalf of the
undersigned, or to take any other action necessary to make an exemption from

required to register any such attempted sale, unless the sale has been effected
in compliance with the terms of this Letter Agreement; and further agrees that
the certificate representing shares of Sovereign common stock owned by the
undersigned may be endorsed with a restrictive legend consistent with the terms
of this Letter Agreement stating in substance as follows:

forth above will be removed from any such certificate (by delivery of a
substitute certificate without such legend) and Sovereign will instruct its
transfer agent to remove such legend from any such certificate, if the
undersigned delivers to Sovereign (i)&nbsp;satisfactory written evidence that the
shares of Sovereign common stock represented by any such certificate have been
sold in compliance with Rule 145(d) (as such rule may be hereafter amended) (in
which case, the substitute certificate will be issued in the name of the
transferee), (ii)&nbsp;a No-Action Correspondence, or (iii)&nbsp;an opinion of counsel,
in form and substance reasonable satisfactory to Sovereign, to the effect that
public sale of shares represented by such certificate by the holder thereof is
no longer subject to the restrictions imposed by Rule&nbsp;145;
