AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

  

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of February 4, 2015, is by and among Office Depot, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), Staples, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and Staples AMS, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "). 

  

    
_WITNESSETH:_ 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent; 

   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger and (iii) resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company (the " _Company Stockholders_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ ") and Merger Sub have unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of Parent and its stockholders or Merger Sub and its stockholder (as the case may be), and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement and (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger; and 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in connection with this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I. 

_THE MERGER_ 

  

 Section 1.1 _The Merger._ At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue its existence under Delaware law as the surviving company in the Merger (the " _Surviving Company_ ") and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. 

  

 Section 1.2 _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston, MA 02109 at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such other place, date and time as the Company and Parent may agree in writing. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_." 

  

 Section 1.3 _Effective Time._ On the Closing Date, the Company shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in accordance with, and containing such information as is required by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL in order to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such time as is agreed between the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (such time is hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").      

 Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger._ The effects of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company, all as provided under the DGCL. 

  

 Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company._ 

  

 (a)_ The certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended by virtue of the Merger at the Effective Time to read in the form of Exhibit A hereto and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

  

 (b)_ The parties hereto shall take all necessary action such that, at the Effective Time and subject to _Section 5.9_, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law, except that the name of the Surviving Company shall be Office Depot, Inc. 

  

 Section 1.6 _Directors._ The parties hereto shall take all necessary action such that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Company at and as of the Effective Time and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. 

   

 Section 1.7 _Officers._ The parties hereto shall take all necessary action such that, except as otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company at and as of the Effective Time and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. 

  

    
ARTICLE II. 

_CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_ 

  

 Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock._ 

  

 (a)_ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or common stock of Merger Sub: 

  

   

 (i) _Common Stock of Merger Sub._ Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

  

 (ii)  _Cancellation of Certain Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock issued immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned or held in treasury by the Company and each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be 

   

      

   

cancelled and shall cease to exist (the " _Cancelled Shares_ "), and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

 (iii) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares, any Dissenting Shares or any shares of Company Common Stock that are owned or held by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive: (A) $7.25 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") and (B) 0.2188 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ " and, together with the Cash Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ") pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this  _ARTICLE II_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and each certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive pursuant to the terms of this Agreement the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificate have been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1_, as well as any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or other distributions to which holders of Company Common Stock become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_. 

  

 (iv) _Company Subsidiary Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned or held by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing Company Common Stock owned or held by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

   

  

 (b) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held by a person (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has not voted in favor of, or consented to, the adoption of this Agreement and has complied with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of shares of Company Common Stock to require appraisal (the " _Appraisal Provisions_ ") of such shares of Company Common Stock (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), to the extent the Appraisal Provisions are applicable, shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as described in _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_, but shall become the right to receive such payment as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal with respect to any Dissenting Shares, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, each such Dissenting Share shall thereupon be treated as though such Dissenting Share had been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_. The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect thereto. The Company shall not, without 

        

the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

  

 (c) _Certain Adjustments._ If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Stock Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change. Nothing in this  _Section 2.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (d) _No Fractional Shares._ No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be delivered upon the conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to  _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ or settlement of Company Stock Awards pursuant to Section 2.3, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger (and each holder of a Company Stock Award settled pursuant to Section 2.3) who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying (i) the Parent Trading Price by (ii) the fraction of a share (after aggregating all shares represented by Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder and rounded to the nearest one-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (the " _Fractional Share Cash Amount_ "). No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates._ 

  

 (a) _Appointment of Exchange Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration and shall enter into an agreement (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") relating to the Exchange Agent\'s responsibilities under this Agreement. 

  

 (b) _Deposit of Merger Consideration._ At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, (i) cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration payable pursuant to  _Section 2.1(a)(iii)(A) _(together with, to the extent then determinable, the Fractional Share Cash Amount) and (ii) evidence of Parent Common Stock in book-entry form (and/or certificates representing such Parent Common Stock, at Parent\'s election) representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate Stock Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)(B) _(such cash and certificates, together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to pursuant to _Section 2.1(d) _and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Parent agrees to make available directly or indirectly to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, until the termination of the Exchange 

        

Fund pursuant to Section 2.2(h), any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor pursuant to
_Section 2.1(d) _and any dividends or other distributions which a holder of
Company Common Stock has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_.

  

 (c) _Exchange Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall, subject to the Company\'s reasonable approval, be in such form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent\'s message" with respect to Book-Entry Shares) as Parent shall reasonably designate) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_. 

  

 (d) _Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares._ Upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent (in the case of Book-Entry Shares, by receipt of the Exchange Agent of an "agent\'s message") together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with any Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer or stock records of the Company, any cash to be paid upon, or shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued upon, due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid or issued, as the case may be, to such a transferee if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

There are no conditions precedent or contingencies (including pursuant to any "market flex" provisions in the related fee letters or otherwise) related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than the conditions precedent expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter (such conditions precedent, the " _Financing Conditions_ "). 

  

 (c)_ The Commitment Letter has not been amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived in any manner prior to the date of this Agreement (and as of the date of this Agreement, no such amendment, restatement or other modification or waiver is contemplated or pending), and the respective commitments contained therein have not been terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and, to the knowledge of Parent, no such termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission is contemplated other than in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of Exhibit D of the Commitment Letter.

All commitments and other fees required to be paid under the Commitment Letter prior to the date of this Agreement have been paid in full, and Parent is unaware of any fact or occurrence existing as of the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to make any of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Commitment Letter inaccurate or that would reasonably be expected to cause the Commitment Letter to be ineffective. 

  

 (g)_ Assuming the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ are satisfied at Closing, the aggregate proceeds contemplated to be provided under the Commitment Letter, together with other financial resources of Parent and Merger Sub, will, in the aggregate, be sufficient for the making of all required payments in connection with the Merger, including payment of the Cash Consideration, the payment of any debt required to be repaid, redeemed, retired, cancelled, terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged in connection with the Merger (including all Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be repaid, redeemed, retired, cancelled, terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged in connection with the Merger, including premiums and fees incurred in connection therewith) and all other amounts to be paid pursuant to this Agreement and associated costs and expenses of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, on the Closing Date. 

  

 (h)_ Parent affirms that it is not a condition to the Closing or to any of its other obligations under this Agreement that it or Merger Sub obtain financing for, or related to, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 4.20 _Solvency._ Immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby) and excluding the effect of any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties contained in _ARTICLE III_ , (a) Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will not have incurred debts beyond their ability to pay such debts as they mature or become due, the then present fair saleable value of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will exceed the amount that will be required to pay their probable Liabilities (including the probable amount of all contingent Liabilities) and debts as they become absolute and matured, (b) the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, at a fair valuation, will exceed their probable Liabilities (including the probable amount of all contingent Liabilities) and debts and (c) Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will not have unreasonably small capital to carry on their businesses as presently conducted or as proposed to be conducted.

 (b)_ Subject to _Section 5.3(c)_ through _Section 5.3(f)_, prior to the Closing, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, (i) withdraw, withhold, modify or qualify, or publicly propose to withdraw, withhold, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, any Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) in the event of the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer for any outstanding shares of the Company\'s capital stock, fail to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Company Stockholders within ten Business Days of the commencement thereof (for the avoidance of doubt, the taking of no position or a neutral position by the Company Board in respect of the acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer by the Company Stockholders as of the end of the ten Business Day period shall constitute a failure to recommend against any such offer), or (iv) recommend that the Company Stockholders not adopt this Agreement or approve the Merger (any action described in clauses (i)-(iv) above being referred to as an " _Company Change of Recommendation_ "). 

  

 (c)_ Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (ii) making any disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if any such public disclosure by the Company has the effect of a Company Change of Recommendation, Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement to the extent set forth in _Section 7.1(d)_. 

  

 (d) _ Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 5.3(a)_ and _Section 5.3(b)_, until the earlier of receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and any termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, if after the date of this Agreement the Company receives a written unsolicited bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors (i) constitutes a Company Superior Proposal or (ii) could reasonably be expected to result in a Company Superior Proposal, then the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives may, subject to _Section 5.3(h)_, take the following actions: (A) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Company Acquisition Proposal, if, and only if, prior to furnishing such information, the Company receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement with provisions no less restrictive to such third party with respect to the use or disclosure of nonpublic information than the Confidentiality Agreement and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party with respect to such Company Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (e) _ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from, at any time prior to, but not after, the time of the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to the receipt of a written unsolicited bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.3_, (i) terminating this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.1(e)_ in order to enter into a definitive written agreement with respect to such Company Acquisition Proposal or (ii) effecting a Company Change of Recommendation, if, prior to taking any of the actions described in clauses (i) or (ii), (A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation 

        

with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that (x) failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
Company directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) such
Company Acquisition Proposal (in the form, other than immaterial changes, that
was the subject of the Superior Proposal Notice) constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal, (B) Parent shall have received written notice (the "
_Superior Proposal Notice_ ") of the Company\'s intention to take such action
at least four Business Days prior to the taking of such action by the Company
and (C) the Company Board continues to believe, after taking into account any
modifications to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that are offered by Parent after its receipt of the Superior Proposal Notice,
that such Company Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Company
Superior Proposal.

  

 (f) _ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company Board from, at any time prior to, but not after, the time of the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, effecting a Company Change of Recommendation (other than in response to the receipt or making of a Company Acquisition Proposal, which shall be subject to _Section 5.3(e)_) if, prior to taking such action, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ that (i) Parent shall have received written notice (a " _Board Recommendation Notice_ ") of the Company Board\'s intention to take any such action at least four Business Days prior to the taking of such action by the Company Board and (ii) the Company Board continues to believe, after taking into account any modifications to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are offered by Parent after its receipt of such Board Recommendation Notice that failing to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 

  

 (g)_ The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any person (other than the parties) conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal and (ii) request each third party that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement that relates to a Company Acquisition Proposal (other than Parent) to return or destroy all confidential information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries heretofore furnished to such third party by the Company or on its behalf. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will take the necessary steps to promptly inform its and its Subsidiaries\' Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this _Section 5.3_. 

  

 (h)_ From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly orally notify Parent of any request for information or any inquiries, proposals or offers relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such person making such request, inquiry, proposal or offer and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and the Company shall provide to Parent written notice of any such inquiry, proposal or offer within 48 hours of such event and copies of any written or electronic correspondence to or from any person making a Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent informed orally, as soon as is reasonably practicable, of the status of any Company Acquisition Proposal, including with respect to the status and terms of any such proposal or offer and whether any such proposal or offer has been withdrawn or rejected and the Company shall provide to Parent written notice of any such withdrawal or rejection and copies of any written proposals or requests for information within 48 hours. The Company also agrees to provide any information to Parent (not previously provided to Parent) that it is providing to another person pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ at substantially the same time it provides such information to such other person. All information provided to Parent under this _Section 5.3_ shall be kept confidential by Parent in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

        

 (i)_ For purposes of this Agreement: 

  

   

 (i)_ " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer made by any person other than Parent or its Subsidiaries with respect to (A) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving the Company, (B) any purchase of an equity interest (including by means of a tender or exchange offer) representing an amount greater than a 15% voting or economic interest in the Company or (C) any purchase of assets, securities or ownership interests representing an amount greater than 15% of the consolidated assets (including stock of the Subsidiaries of the Company), consolidated net revenues or earnings before interest, Taxes, depreciation and amortization of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that any proposal or offer relating to any purchase of assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries contemplated by Section 5.6(e) shall not be deemed a Company Acquisition Proposal, but shall be subject to Section 5.6(e). 

  

 (ii) _ " _Company Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal (except that references in the definition of the "Company Acquisition Proposal" to 15% shall be replaced by 50%) made after the date of this Agreement by any person other than Parent or its Subsidiaries on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and considering such factors as the Company Board considers to be appropriate (including the timing and likelihood of consummation of such proposal), are more favorable to the Company and the Company Stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account any change to the transaction proposed by Parent. 

   

  

 Section 5.4 _Filings; Other Actions._ 

  

 (a)_ As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, but in no event earlier than the record date set by the Company. Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state or provincial securities laws in connection with the issuance and reservation of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish each other all information reasonably requested by the other (including concerning itself and its stockholders, or holders of a beneficial interest therein) in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, or response to SEC comments with respect thereto, will be made by Parent or the Company, as applicable, without the other\'s prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company, in connection with a Company Change of Recommendation, may amend or supplement the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement (including by incorporation by reference) to effect such change (it being understood that any such amendment or supplement shall solely contain (i) such Company Change of Recommendation and (ii) a statement of the reasons of the Company Board for making such Company Change of Recommendation, and the right of consent set forth in this _Section 5.4(a)_ shall not apply with respect to information in such amendment or supplement required by clauses (i) and (ii)). Parent or the Company, as applicable, will advise the other promptly after it receives oral or written notice of the time when the Registration Statement has 

        

become effective or any supplement or amendment thereto has been filed, the
issuance of any stop order relating thereto, the suspension of the
qualification of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection
with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or
written request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information, and will promptly provide the other
with copies of any written communication between it or any of
its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff or any state
securities commission, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement,
the Registration Statement or the Merger. Subject to the other provisions set
forth in this _Section 5.4_, each of the Company and Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any comments from the SEC with respect to the Registration Statement or the
Proxy Statement and to have any stop order relating thereto or suspension
lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information is discovered by Parent or the Company which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents
would not include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company.

  

 (b)_ The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Laws and the Company Organizational Documents to set a record date for, duly give notice of, convene and, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective, hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Stockholders\' Meeting_ "). Except as expressly permitted by _Section 5.3(e)_ or  _Section 5.3(f)_, the Company Board shall not make any Company Change of Recommendation and, except to the extent that the Company Board shall have made a Company Change of Recommendation as permitted by _Section 5.3(e)_ or _Section 5.3(f)_, shall include its recommendation that the Company\'s stockholders vote in favor of the Merger in the Proxy Statement and, subject to _Section 5.3(e)_ and _Section 5.3(f),_ shall solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders\' Meeting. The Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders\' Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be entitled to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders\' Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, if on a date for which the Company Stockholders\' Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, if, and only if, the Company Stockholders\' Meeting is scheduled to reconvene on a date that is (i) 30 or less days after the date for which the Company Stockholders\' Meeting was originally scheduled or (ii) 10 or less Business Days prior to the End Date. 

  

 (c)_ The Company shall cooperate with and keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. 

  

 (d)_ Immediately following execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties, Parent, as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, shall adopt this Agreement and, promptly thereafter, deliver to the Company a copy of the written consent reflecting the adoption of the Agreement by Parent as sole stockholder of Merger Sub or the minutes of the stockholders meeting of Merger Sub at which this Agreement was adopted.

For purposes of determining the employee benefits and annual bonus opportunities in place immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company and their respective Subsidiaries may disregard any compensation and benefits that are triggered by or in part as a result of the Merger, any retention awards or arrangements, any change in control bonuses, any parachute gross-ups, and any modifications of equity compensation or bonus programs to take into account the requirements of the transactions. The foregoing notwithstanding, Parent agrees to comply with the requirements of applicable Law with respect to the treatment of Excluded Employees and to honor, or to cause the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Effective Time to honor, in accordance with their terms all Company Plans and Company Foreign Plans and all collective bargaining agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound, _provided_  that such plans or agreements may be amended, terminated or suspended in accordance with their terms and applicable Law in accordance with this _Section 5.5_. The Company shall, or shall cause any of its applicable Subsidiaries to, comply with all notice and consultation provisions of all collective bargaining or other labor agreements to which it or such subsidiary is a party or otherwise bound, to the extent required by any such collective bargaining or other labor agreements or applicable Law. 

  

 (b)_ Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by Parent or the Surviving Company or their Subsidiaries in which Company Employees in the United States (the " _U.S. Company Employees_ ") are initially eligible to participate following the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Post-Closing Plans_ ") to recognize the service of each U.S. Company Employee with the Company prior to the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual under such Post-Closing Plans (and under Company Plans that continue after the Closing Date (the " _Continuing Company Plans_ "));  _provided_ , that such recognition of service shall not (i) apply for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit retirement plan or plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, (ii) operate to duplicate any benefits of a U.S. Company Employee with respect to the same period of service or (iii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement (x) under which similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (y) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or participation. With respect to any Post-Closing Plan that provides medical, dental or vision insurance benefits, for the plan year in which such U.S. Company Employee is first eligible to participate, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (A) cause any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such plan to be waived with respect to such U.S. Company Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the 

        

Company Plan in which such U.S. Company Employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (B) credit each U.S. Company Employee for an
amount equal to any medical, dental or vision expenses incurred, under a
Continuing Company Plan, by such U.S. Company Employee in the Post-Closing
Plan plan year that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the plan year in
which such U.S. Company Employee is first eligible to participate in such
Post-Closing Plan) for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-
of-pocket expense requirements under any such Post-Closing Plan, subject to
(i) the applicable information being provided to Parent in a form that Parent
reasonably determines is administratively feasible to take into account under
its plans and (ii) compliance with any applicable Laws; provided that no such
credit under clause (B) shall be required with respect to any plan year of a
Continuing Company Plan that is completed before the employee is admitted to
the Post-Closing Plan.

  

 (c)_ Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Company or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Company Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause (subject to compliance with applicable Law). In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Plan, Company Foreign Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, Surviving Company, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Plan, Company Foreign Plan or any other compensation or benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of this _Section 5.5_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this  _Section 5.5,_ express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person (including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former directors, officers, employees, contractors or consultants of any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries) any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 5.5_ or is intended to be, shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to or modification of any employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company or any respective Subsidiary thereof.

 (a)_ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as soon as practicable (and in any event prior to the End Date), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) obtaining and maintaining all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, licenses, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals (collectively, " _Consents_ ") from Governmental Authorities and the making of all other necessary registrations and filings, (ii) obtaining all Consents from third parties that are necessary or

Agreement. Nothing set forth in this  _Section 5.6_ limits, modifies,
waives, amends or otherwise adversely affects (x) either party\'s ability to

 (d)_ In connection with and without limiting _Section 5.6(a)_, but subject to  _Section 5.6(e)_, each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration or termination of the waiting periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement (and in any event prior to the End Date), including using its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other federal, state or foreign statues, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative or judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "). In connection therewith and subject to _Section 5.6(e)_, if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Laws, each of Parent and the Company shall vigorously contest and resist any such Action (through negotiation, litigation or otherwise), including any administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent (each an " _Order_ "), that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, delays or restricts the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal. 

       

                                     

   

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall not, without the written consent of Parent, offer or agree to divest, license, hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or otherwise commit any of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries to take any action that limits any freedom of action with respect to their ability to retain or operate any of their businesses, services or assets (any such divestiture, license, hold separate or such other commitment to take action with respect to any businesses, services or assets is hereinafter referred to as an " _Antitrust Restraint_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as expressly set forth in this _Section 5.6(e)_, Parent shall not be required to agree to or effect any Antitrust Restraint with respect to any of Parent\'s or the Company\'s or their respective Subsidiaries\' businesses, services or assets. If necessary to avoid the commencement of any Action by any Governmental Authority challenging the transactions under this Agreement under the Antitrust Laws, or if already commenced, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Order that would prohibit, prevent or restrict the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then, subject to the penultimate sentence of this _Section 5.6(e)_, Parent shall offer, negotiate and agree to, and shall effect, any Antitrust Restraint with respect to the Company\'s businesses, services or assets, except that Parent shall not be required to agree to or effect any Antitrust Restraint with respect to any of the Company\'s businesses, services or assets, other than, to the extent necessary to avoid the commencement of any such Action or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any such Order, (i) an Antitrust Restraint with respect to businesses, services or assets of the Company in the United States that, in the aggregate, generated or were reasonably necessary to service no more than $1,250,000,000 of the Company\'s revenues in calendar year 2014; and (ii) an Antitrust Restraint with respect to businesses, services or assets of the Company outside the United States that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the businesses of the Company outside the United States, taken as a whole. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not be required to agree to or effect any Antitrust Restraint with respect to the Company or Parent unless such actions are conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing or are effective on or after the Closing, and neither party shall be required to waive any of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VI_ of this Agreement as they apply to such party. None of the actions taken or proposed to be taken pursuant to this _Section 5.6(e)_ shall be deemed to result in a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or shall be considered for purposes of determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect has occurred.

Conditions) set forth in the Commitment Letter and any definitive agreements
executed in connection therewith within Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s control

less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than the terms and conditions
(including, if necessary, the exercise of "market flex" provisions in the

the Financing at or prior to the Closing. In the event that all Financing
Conditions have been or, upon funding of the Financing will be, satisfied,

Subject to _Section 5.18(d)_, Parent and Merger Sub shall not permit or consent to any waiver of any remedy under the Commitment Letter or to any early termination of the Commitment Letter. Upon any such amendment, replacement, supplement or modification, the term "Commitment Letter" shall mean the Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented or modified.

the Financing and (ii) of the receipt by any of Parent or Merger Sub or any
of their respective Affiliates or Representatives of any written notice from
any Financing Source, lender or any other person with respect to any (A)
actual, threatened or alleged breach, default, termination or repudiation by
any party to the Commitment Letter or any definitive financing
agreement entered into in connection with the Financing or any provision of
the Financing contemplated pursuant to the Commitment Letter or any definitive
financing agreement entered into in connection with the Financing (including
any proposal by any Financing Source, lender or other person to withdraw,
terminate or make a material change in the terms of (including the amount of
Financing contemplated by) the Commitment Letter that would reasonably be
expected to affect the timely availability of, or the amount of, such
Financing) or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among
any parties to the Commitment Letter or any definitive financing agreement
entered into in connection with the Financing, if such dispute or disagreement
would reasonably be expected to affect the timely availability of, or amount
of, the Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within
two (2) Business Days after the Company delivers to Parent a written request,
Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company
relating to any of the circumstances referred to in this 5.18(c).

  

 (d)_ Parent shall have the right to substitute the proceeds of consummated offerings or other incurrences of debt (including notes) for all or any portion of the Financing by reducing commitments under the Commitment Letter. Further, Parent shall have the right to substitute commitments in respect of other financing for all or any portion of the Financing from the same and/or alternative bona fide third-party financing sources (which will be in an amount sufficient to pay, when added to the other resources of Parent and other financing arrangements, for the making of all required payments in connection with the Merger, including payment of the Cash Consideration, the payment of any debt required to be repaid, redeemed, retired, cancelled, terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged in connection with the Merger (including all Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be repaid, redeemed, retired, cancelled, terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged in connection with the Merger, including premiums and fees incurred in connection therewith) and all other amounts to be paid pursuant to this Agreement and associated costs and expenses of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, on the Closing Date) so long as all conditions precedent to funding of such financing are in the aggregate, in respect of certainty of funding, equivalent to (or more favorable to the Company than) the conditions precedent set forth in the Commitment Letter, to replace the Financing contemplated by such expired, replaced, terminated or unavailable commitments or agreements (" _Alternative Financing_ "). If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent to satisfy its obligations under this _Section 5.18(d)_, any of the Financing or the Commitment Letter (or any definitive financing agreement relating thereto) expire or are terminated or otherwise become unavailable prior to the Closing, in whole or in part, for any reason, Parent will (i) promptly notify the Company of such expiration, termination or unavailability and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts promptly to arrange for alternative financing from other sources so long as such alternative financing would constitute an Alternative Financing. True, complete and accurate copies of each commitment letter and other agreement relating to the Alternative Financing (the " _Alternative Commitment Letter_ ") will be promptly provided to the Company. If applicable, references in this Agreement to "Financing" will include "Alternative Financing," any reference to "Commitment Letter" will include the "Alternative Commitment Letter" and any reference to definitive financing agreements related to the Financing will include the definitive financing agreements related to the Alternative Financing. 

  

 (e)_ Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, use their reasonable best efforts to provide on a timely basis all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary, proper or advisable in connection with any financing by Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with the Merger, including (i) facilitating the delivery by the Company\'s independent auditors of consents to use their audit reports in

Merger; (iii) updating information provided in writing by Parent describing

Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter such that, after giving effect
to such updates, such information, when taken as a whole along with the
Company SEC Documents filed by the Company since January 1, 2014 through such

material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements contained therein not materially misleading in light of the
circumstances under which such statements are made; (iv) facilitating the
pledging of collateral and executing and delivering definitive documentation
with respect to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter, including taking all actions reasonably necessary to establish bank

reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and its or
their marks; (vii) causing the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' senior
officers to participate, but only together with the senior officers of Parent

operations of the Company and the Company\'s Subsidiaries, (B) nothing in
this _Section 5.18(e)_ shall require cooperation to the extent that it would
(x) cause any condition to the Closing set forth in _Section 6.1_ or

termination, the Company enters into a letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement with respect to,
or publicly announces, a Business Combination or consummates a Business
Combination, then the Company will, prior to the earlier of the consummation
of a Business Combination or execution of a definitive agreement with

 (e)_ If this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ due to actions arising under Antitrust Law; (ii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ due to a material breach by Parent of _Section 5.6_, which breach results in the conditions set forth in either _Section 6.1(b)_ or _Section 6.1(c)_ (but only, in the case of  _Section 6.1(c)_, if the failure to meet such condition is a result of any Antitrust Law) being incapable of being satisfied; or (iii) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ (in the case of termination by Parent, only under circumstances in which the Company has a concurrent right to terminate pursuant to  _Section 7.1(c)_) and as of the End Date, (A) one or more of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ and  _Section 6.1(c)_ has not been satisfied (but only, in the case of _Section 6.1(c)_, if the failure to meet such condition is a result of any Antitrust Law) and (B) all of the other conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VI_ have been satisfied (other than any such conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date but subject to such conditions being capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of termination), then Parent will, within three Business Days following any such termination, pay to the Company or its designee in cash by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated by the Company a termination fee in an amount equal to $250,000,000 (the " _Regulatory Fee_ ").

 (g)_ The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall a party be required to pay the Termination Fee or Regulatory Fee on more than one occasion or in combination with one another. In the event the Termination Fee or Regulatory Fee is paid to a party in accordance with this _Section 7.2_, except in the case of fraud by the other party such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of such party and its Subsidiaries, stockholders and Representatives against the other party or any of its Subsidiaries, stockholders and Representatives with respect to the termination, event or breach giving rise to that payment.

contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts.
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts, (b) any
claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any
such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (i) the
suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum,
(ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the parties
hereto hereby consents to the service of process in accordance with  _Section
8.7_; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall affect the right of
any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  

 (b) _ NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM, SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION, WHETHER IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, INVOLVING ANY FINANCING SOURCES UNDER THE FINANCING OR ANY AFFILIATE THEREOF ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, THE FINANCING, ANY ALTERNATIVE FINANCING, THE COMMITMENT LETTER, THE COMMITMENT LETTERS IN RESPECT OF ANY ALTERNATIVE FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES THEREUNDER, THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT (I) SUCH CLAIMS, SUITS, ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK OR ANY NEW YORK STATE COURT SITTING IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF NEW YORK, BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN, AND (II) THEY SHALL NOT BRING, OR PERMIT ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES OR ANY COMPANY RELATED PARTY TO BRING, ANY SUCH CLAIM, SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY OTHER COURT. 

  

 Section 8.6 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._ EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE FINANCING OR ANY ALTERNATIVE FINANCING, THE COMMITMENT LETTER, ANY COMMITMENT LETTERS IN RESPECT OF ANY ALTERNATIVE FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF). 

   

 Section 8.7 _Notices._ All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (a) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified; (b) when received when sent by email or facsimile by the party to be notified, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that notice given by email or facsimile shall not be effective unless either (i) a duplicate copy of such email or fax notice is promptly given by one of the other methods described in this _Section 8.7_ or (ii) the receiving party delivers a written confirmation of receipt for such notice either by email or fax or any other method
