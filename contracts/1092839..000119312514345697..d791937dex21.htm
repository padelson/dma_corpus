number of Shares (but not less than that number) (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_
") equal to the lowest number of Shares that, together with the number of
Shares collectively owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, Merger
Subsidiary and/or their affiliates at the time of such exercise, shall
constitute one Share more than 90% of the total Shares then outstanding
(assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) at a purchase price per
Top-Up Option Share equal to the Offer Price.

 



17 (b) Subject to satisfaction of all of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than those conditions that by their nature must be satisfied on the
Closing Date), if there shall not have been validly tendered in the Offer and
not validly withdrawn that number of Shares which, when added to the Shares
owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their respective Affiliates, would
represent at least 90% of the Shares outstanding (treating Shares owned by the
Company as treasury stock as not outstanding) at the Acceptance Time (the "
_Short-Form Threshold")_ , then Parent shall exercise the Top-Up Option for
such number of Top-Up Option Shares as is necessary for Parent to reach the
Short-Form Threshold. Moreover, the Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only
once in whole and not in part and only at such time as Parent and Merger
Subsidiary and their affiliates hold, in the aggregate, at least a majority of
the issued and outstanding Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable: (i) to the
extent that the Top-Up Option Shares would exceed the number of authorized
but unissued shares of the Companys common stock that are not reserved or
otherwise committed to be issued; (ii) if any Law or Order then in effect
shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-
Up Option Shares; or (iii) if Parent or Merger Subsidiary has not accepted for
payment all Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn. The
closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares shall take place at the
location of the Closing specified in _Section 3.1(b)_, and shall take place
simultaneously with, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, the
Acceptance Time. Without the prior written consent of the Company, the right
to exercise the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this Agreement shall not be
assigned by Parent other than to a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent,
including by operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent
of the Company. Any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section
2.3(b)_ shall be null and void.

(c) In the event that Parent shall exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent shall
send to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ")
specifying (i) the number of Shares owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary and
their affiliates at the time of such notice (giving effect to the closing of
the Offer) and (ii) the manner in which Parent intends to pay the applicable
purchase price of the Top-Up Option Shares. Such Top-Up Exercise Notice shall
also include an undertaking signed by Parent and Merger Subsidiary that, as
promptly as practicable following such exercise of the Top-Up Option, Merger
Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to, consummate the
Merger in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL. The Company shall,
promptly after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice
to Merger Subsidiary confirming, based on the information provided by Parent
in the Top-Up Exercise Notice, (i) the number of Shares then outstanding
(assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares), and (ii) the number of
Top-Up Option Shares issuable under the Top-Up Option and the aggregate
purchase price therefore.

 

(d) At the Closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, (i) the Company shall deliver to
Merger Subsidiary the Top-Up Option Shares and (ii) Merger Subsidiary shall
purchase each Top-Up Option Share from the Company at the Offer Price. Payment
of the aggregate purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares may be made, at
Merger Subsidiarys option, by delivery of (x) immediately available funds by
wire transfer to an account designated by the Company or (y) a combination

 



18  of cash equal to an amount not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-
Up Option Shares and a promissory note for the remainder of the purchase price
for the Top-Up Option Shares. Any such promissory note shall be full recourse
to Parent and Merger Subsidiary, shall bear interest at the applicable federal
rate as determined for U.S. income tax purposes, shall mature on the first
anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory note,
may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty and shall have no other
material terms.

(e) Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares
that Merger Subsidiary may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not
be registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each
of Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereby represents and warrants to the Company
that it is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an
"accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated
under the Securities Act, and that any Top-Up Option Shares are being acquired
for investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

 

(f) The parties will cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares comply with all
applicable Laws.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of Parent,
Merger Subsidiary and the Company agrees and acknowledges that, in any
appraisal proceeding under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Dissenting
Shares, the Surviving Corporation shall not assert that the Top-Up Option, the
Top-Up Option Shares or any cash or promissory note delivered by Purchaser to
the Company in payment for the Top-Up Shares should be considered in
connection with the determination of the fair market value of the shares of
Company Common Stock held by dissenting stockholders in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL.

ARTICLE III. __

 

 _THE MERGER_

3.1  _The Merger_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, and in accordance
with the provisions of the DGCL, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and
into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Merger, the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ")
and shall continue its corporate existence under the Laws of the State of
Delaware, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall
cease.

(b) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at a
location designated by the Company which is reasonably satisfactory to the
Parent, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date designated by the Company which
is reasonably satisfactory to Parent, which shall be as soon as practicable,
but not later than two (2) Business Days, after satisfaction or waiver of all
of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that
by their nature must be satisfied on the Closing Date), or at such other
place, time and date as the parties hereto shall agree. The date on which the
Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

 



19 (c) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, during the Closing, the
parties to this Agreement shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware
Secretary of State_ ") a certificate of merger or other appropriate document
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by and executed
in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective when the
Certificate of Merger has been filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or
at such later time as shall be agreed upon by Parent and the Company and
specified in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

(d) In the event that Parent, Merger Subsidiary and any other Subsidiary of
Parent shall collectively own at least 90% of the outstanding Shares after
consummation of the Offer and, if applicable, exercise of the Top-Up Option,
following the satisfaction or waiver (by the parties) of the conditions set
forth in _Article VII_ , Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company hereby
agree to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to
become effective, without a meeting of the holders of Shares, in accordance
with Section 253 of the DGCL as promptly as practicable.

(e) The Merger shall have the effects specified under the DGCL. As of the
Effective Time, the Company shall be a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all property, rights, powers, privileges and franchises
of Merger Subsidiary shall vest in the Company as the Surviving Corporation,
and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation
may, at any time after the Effective Time, take any action (including
executing and delivering any document) in the name and on behalf of either the
Company or Merger Subsidiary in order to carry out and effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Surviving Corporation shall
thereafter be responsible and liable for all the liabilities and obligations
of the Company and Merger Subsidiary.

 

3.2 _Certificate of Incorporation_.

 

The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, from and after
the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Surviving Charter_ "), until amended as provided in the
Surviving Charter or by applicable Law.

 

3.3 _Bylaws_.

The Company shall take all requisite action so that the Bylaws of Merger
Subsidiary in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, from
and after the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the "
_Surviving Bylaws_ "), until amended in accordance with the Surviving
Charter, the Surviving Bylaws or by applicable Law.

 



20 3.4 _Directors and Officers_.

 

Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall take all requisite action so that
the directors of Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be, from and after the Effective Time, the directors of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors are duly elected and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Surviving Charter, the Surviving Bylaws and the DGCL.

3.5 _Additional Actions_.

 

If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
consider or be advised that any further deeds, assignments or assurances in
Law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect or
confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title
or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of
the Company or (b) otherwise carry out the provisions of this Agreement, the
Company and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to the
Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver
all such deeds, assignments or assurances in Law and to take all acts
necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to and
possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation
and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the name of the
Company or otherwise to take any and all such action.

 

3.6 _Conversion of Shares_.

 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company or the holders of any of the
securities of the Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Company:

(a) each Share held immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company or
any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company and each issued and outstanding
Share owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any other Subsidiary of Parent and
all Shares held in treasury by the Company shall be canceled automatically
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment or consideration shall
be made with respect thereto;

(b) each issued and outstanding Share other than (i) Shares referred to in
_Section 3.6(a)_ and (ii) Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Offer Price
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any
such Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest; and

 

(c) each share of capital stock of Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par, of the Surviving
Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so
converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

 



21 3.7 _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as disbursing agent (the "
_Disbursing Agent_ ") for the purpose of receiving and exchanging the payment
of Merger Consideration for the benefit of the Company stockholders upon
surrender of certificates representing the Shares. The Disbursing Agent
shall also act as the agent for the Company stockholders for the purpose of
holding the certificates representing the Shares and shall obtain no rights or
interests in the Shares represented by such certificates. Parent will enter
into a disbursing agent agreement with the Disbursing Agent, and at such
times, and from time to time, as the Disbursing Agent requires funds to make
the payments pursuant to _Section 3.6(b)_, Parent shall deposit or cause to
be deposited with the Disbursing Agent cash in an aggregate amount necessary
to make the payments pursuant to _Section 3.6(b)_ to holders of Shares (such
amounts being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). For
purposes of determining the aggregate amount to be so deposited, Parent and
Merger Subsidiary shall assume that no stockholders of the Company will
perfect any right to appraisal of his, her or its Shares. The Disbursing Agent
shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided that such
investments shall be (i) direct obligations of the United States of America,
(ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest,
(iii) commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moodys Investors
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation or (iv) a combination of any
of the foregoing; provided further that no loss thereon or thereof shall
affect the amounts payable to holders of Shares pursuant to _Section 3.6(b)_.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a
part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable
under _Section 3.6(b)_ shall be promptly paid to Parent. If for any reason
(including losses) such funds are inadequate to pay all amounts to which
holders of Shares shall be entitled hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit
or cause to be deposited additional cash with the Disbursing Agent sufficient
to make all payments required under this Agreement, and Parent and the Merger
Subsidiary shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. Parent shall bear and pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Disbursing Agent, incurred in
connection with the exchange of Shares and the Exchange Fund.

 

(b) Parent shall cause the Disbursing Agent to mail promptly after the
Effective Time, but in no event later than the third (3rd) Business Day
thereafter, to each Person who was a record holder as of the Effective Time of
an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ "), and whose Shares
were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.6(b)_, (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Disbursing Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate to the Disbursing Agent for cancellation, together
with such letter of transmittal duly executed and such other documents as may
be reasonably required by the Disbursing Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of that Certificate, less any required withholding of
Taxes, to be mailed within five (5) Business Days of the receipt of such
Certificate and executed letter of transmittal by the Distributing Agent, and
such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the Certificates.

 



22 (c) If payment of any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment of such Merger Consideration
that the Certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable.

(d) Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
3.7_, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Shares owned by
Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any other subsidiary of Parent, Shares held by
the Company and Dissenting Shares) shall represent for all purposes, from and
after the Effective Time, only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate.

(e) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such Shares except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable
Law. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously
represented by such Certificates. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, such Certificates
shall represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
this _Article III_. At the close of business on the day of the
Effective Time, the stock ledger of the Company shall be closed.

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Disbursing
Agent to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall
be returned to Parent upon demand by Parent. At any time more than eighteen
(18) months after the Effective Time, the Disbursing Agent shall upon demand
of Parent deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the
Disbursing Agent and not disbursed in exchange for Certificates (including all
interest and other income received by the Disbursing Agent in respect of all
such funds). Thereafter, holders of Certificates shall look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to the terms of this Agreement, abandoned
property, escheat and other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with
respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable, without interest,
upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed immediately prior to such time when such amounts would otherwise
escheat or become the property of any governmental unit or agency, shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent
shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for any Merger Consideration
delivered in respect of such Certificate of Shares to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law.

 



23 3.8 _Company Stock Options, Company Warrants and Other Payments_.

 

(a) Each option to acquire Shares granted under any Company Stock Plan (each,
a " _Company Stock Option_ ") that is not fully exercisable as of the date of
this Agreement will automatically become fully vested and exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of the
applicable Company Stock Plan. At the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Option, without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or the holder of any such Company Stock Option, shall be canceled
and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to (i) the Option Consideration multiplied by (ii) the aggregate number
of Shares into which the applicable Company Stock Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, that if the exercise price
per Share of any such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the
Offer Price, such Company Stock Option shall be canceled without any cash
payment being made in respect thereof. Any payment made pursuant to this
_Section 3.8(a)_ to the holder of any Company Stock Option shall be reduced
by any income or employment Tax withholding required under (A) the Code, (B)
any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws or (C) any other applicable
Laws. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld, those amounts shall be
treated as having been paid to the holder of that Company Stock Option for all
purposes under this Agreement. The Company, or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall make the payments in respect of the Company Stock
Options as promptly as practicable following the cancellation of such Company
Stock Options as contemplated by this _Section 3.8(a)_ by checks payable to
the holders of such Company Stock Options unless the aggregate amount
payable to a particular individual exceeds $10,000, in which event payment
may be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds upon receipt by
the Company of written payment instructions from the relevant option holder.
Upon written notice from the Company, Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to
pay to the Company an amount in cash sufficient to fund the Companys payment
obligation under this _Section 3.8(a)_ as such amounts are paid (such amount
to be set forth in such written notice). The Company shall take all requisite
action so that, immediately following such payment, each Company Stock Option
shall be canceled and the applicable Company Stock Plans shall be terminated.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, those individuals designated by the Company in
accordance with the Retention Plan, as amended (the " _Eligible Persons_ ")
shall receive, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the amount so
designated by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Retention Plan,
as amended. Any payment made pursuant to this  _Section 3.8(b)_ to an
Eligible Person shall be reduced by any income Tax withholding required under
(i) the Code, (ii) any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws or (iii)
any other applicable Laws. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld,
those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the Eligible Person for
all purposes under this Agreement. The Company shall make the payments
pursuant to the Retention Plan, as amended, as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time by checks payable to the Eligible
Persons unless the aggregate amount payable to a particular individual exceeds
$10,000, in which event payment may be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds upon receipt by the Company of written payment instructions
from the relevant Eligible Person. Upon written notice from the Company,
Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to pay to the Company an amount in cash
sufficient to fund the Companys payment obligation under this _Section
3.8(b)_ as such amounts are paid (such amount to be set forth in such written
notice). The Company shall take all requisite action so that, immediately
following such payment, the Retention Plan shall be canceled and terminated.

 



24 (c) At the Effective Time, each employee of the Company, who has been granted
the right by the Company to a severance payment under the Dune Energy, Inc.
Employee Severance Plan, as amended, dated November 14, 2012 (the " _Severance
Plan_ "), and who is involuntarily terminated without cause or resigns for
Good Reason (as defined in the Severance Plan) in connection with the Merger
(the " _Severance Plan Eligible Employees_ "), shall have the right to
receive, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the amount so
designated by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Severance Plan.
Any payment made pursuant to this _Section 3.8(c)_ to a Severance Plan
Eligible Employee shall be reduced by any income Tax withholding required
under (i) the Code, (ii) any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws or
(iii) any other applicable Laws. To the extent that any amounts are so
withheld, those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the Severance
Plan Eligible Employee for all purposes under this Agreement. The Company
shall make the payments pursuant to the Severance Plan as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time by checks payable to the Severance
Plan Eligible Employees. Upon written notice from the Company, Parent
shall cause Merger Subsidiary to pay to the Company an amount in cash
sufficient to fund the Companys payment obligation under this _Section
3.8(c)_ as such amounts are paid (such amount to be set forth in such written
notice).

 

(d) The Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering
the Company Equity Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such actions
as may be required to provide that, effective as of the Effective Time, each
outstanding restricted share, restricted share unit and deferred stock unit of
the Company (collectively, the " _Company Restricted Shares_ ") shall be
cancelled and in consideration of such cancellation converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.6(b)_. Any
payment made pursuant to this _Section 3.8(d)_ to the holder of any Company
Restricted Share shall be reduced by any income or employment Tax withholding
required under (i) any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws or (ii) any
other applicable Laws.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, or the Company, each
outstanding unexercised warrant to purchase or otherwise acquire Shares (the "
_Company Warrants_ ") shall be accelerated and automatically become fully
vested, cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any
such cancelled Company Warrant shall be entitled to receive, in consideration
of the cancellation of such Company Warrant and in settlement therefor, a
payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of
Shares previously subject to such Company Warrant, and (ii) the excess, if
any, of the Offer Price over the exercise price per Share previously subject
to such Company Warrant (such amounts payable hereunder, the " _Warrant
Payments_ "). From and after the Effective Time, any such cancelled Company
Warrant shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall
only entitle such holder to the payment of the Warrant Payment. Promptly
following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver written
notice to each holder of a Company Warrant, in accordance with the terms of
the applicable Company Warrant, informing such holders of the effect of the
Merger on the Company Warrants.

 



25 3.9 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that
are held by any record holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or
consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal rights in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration but shall
be canceled and terminated and shall cease to have any rights with respect to
Dissenting Shares other than such rights as are granted pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that any holder of Dissenting Shares who
shall have failed to perfect or shall have withdrawn or lost his rights to
appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, in each case under the DGCL, shall
forfeit the right to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted into the right to receive, as
of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration without interest.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 3.9_, if
the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of any stockholder to be
paid the fair value of such stockholders Dissenting Shares shall cease. The
Surviving Corporation shall comply with all of its obligations under the DGCL
with respect to holders of Dissenting Shares.

 

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any demands for
appraisal, any withdrawals of such demands received by the Company and any
other related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company, and (ii) the opportunity to direct and participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or negotiate, offer
to settle or settle any such demands.

 

3.10 _Adjustments_.

If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding Shares shall occur
(other than as the result of the exercise, vesting or conversion of any
Company Stock Options or Company Restricted Shares) which is otherwise
permitted by this Agreement, including by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of Shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, as the case may be, shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such change.

 

3.11 _Withholding Rights_.

 

Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause the Disbursing Agent to deduct and withhold, from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law.
If the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds
amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

 



26 3.12 _Lost Certificates_.

 

If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed in form reasonably acceptable to the Disbursing
Agent, the Disbursing Agent will pay, in exchange for such affidavit claiming
such Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, the Merger Consideration to
be paid in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this Article.

ARTICLE IV. __

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 

Except as disclosed in the SEC Reports or in the Companys Disclosure Letter,
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Subsidiary as
follows:

4.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_

 

The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Each of the Companys
Subsidiaries is duly incorporated or formed, as the case may be, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization or formation (as the case may be). The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate and limited liability power (as the
case may be) and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is qualified or
licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or the properties owned, operated or leased
by it makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except
where the failure to have such power or authority, or the failure to be so
qualified, licensed or in good standing, would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. A true and complete list of all of the Companys Subsidiaries
as of the date hereof, together with the jurisdiction of incorporation or
formation of each such Subsidiary and the percentage of the outstanding
capital stock or other equity interest of each such Subsidiary owned by
Company and each other Company Subsidiary as of such date is set forth on
_Section 4.1_ of the Companys Disclosure Letter. Except as set forth in
_Section 4.1_ of the Companys Disclosure Letter, the Company does not
directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar
interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business
association or entity, other than indirect equity and similar interests held

respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is not exempt under Section 408 of

ERISA or an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1)
of ERISA, the Company has prepared in good faith and timely filed all
requisite governmental reports, including any required audit reports, and has

otherwise).

 

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 4.13(c)_ of the Companys Disclosure
Letter, none of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
hereby or any termination of employment or service in connection therewith or
subsequent thereto will (i) result in any payment (including
severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise)
becoming due to any Person other than accrued payments, (ii) materially
increase or otherwise enhance any benefits otherwise payable by the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time
of payment or vesting of any such benefits, except as required under Section
411(d)(3) of the Code, (iv) increase the amount of compensation due to any
Person, or (v) result in the forgiveness in whole or in part of any

business and consistent with past practice), and (iv) there are no
controversies pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, between
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and any of their respective
employees, which controversies have or would result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

leasehold interest in any such property is subject to any Lien, except for

any Liens, except for Permitted Liens or those Liens as are set forth in 
_Section 4.18(b)_ of the Companys Disclosure Letter and except where the
failure to have such title would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) The Company or its Subsidiaries have Good and Defensible Title to the Oil
and Gas Interests included in the Company Reserve Report (other than Oil and
Gas Interests disposed of in the ordinary course since December 31, 2013) free

Companys proved oil and gas reserves attributable to the Companys Oil and
Gas Interests as of the date set forth in such reports described in _Section

guidelines with respect thereto of the SEC. Except for changes (including
changes in Hydrocarbon commodity prices) generally affecting the oil and gas
industry and normal depletion by production, there has been no change in
respect of the matters addressed in the Company Reserve Report that would have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. Set forth in _Section 4.19(a)_ of the

paid, except in each case as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and Company Subsidiaries
have paid all royalties, overriding royalties and other burdens on production
due by the Company and Company Subsidiaries with respect to their Oil and Gas
Interests, except for ordinary and usual post-period adjustments and any
nonpayment that individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not be
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has produced Hydrocarbons
from its Oil and Gas Interests in excess of regulatory allowables or other
applicable legal limits on production that could reasonably be expected to
result in curtailment of production from any such property, except any such
excess production which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 4.19(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, none of the Oil and Gas Interests of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries is subject to any preferential purchase, consent or
similar right that would become operative as a result of the transactions

is in violation of any applicable Law or contract requiring the Company to
plug and abandon any well.

With respect to the Oil and Gas Interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries
that are not operated by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, the Company
makes the representations and warranties in this subparagraphs (b)  (e) only
to its Knowledge without having made specific inquiry of the operators with
respect hereto.

without then or thereafter being entitled to receive full value therefor,
and, on a net, Company-wide basis, the Company is neither underproduced nor
overproduced, in either case, to any extent that would have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, under gas balancing or similar arrangements;

 

(b) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is bound by any future,
hedge, swap, collar, put, call, floor, cap, option or other contract that is
intended to benefit from, relate to or reduce or eliminate the risk of

rates, currencies or securities (a " _Derivative Transaction_ "); and 

 



42 (c) no Person has any call upon, option to purchase, or similar rights with
respect to the production of Hydrocarbons attributable to the Oil and Gas
Interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries, except for any such call,
option or similar right at market prices, and upon consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company or its Subsidiaries
will have the right to market production from the Oil and Gas Interests of the
Company and its Subsidiaries on terms no less favorable than the terms upon

shares of common stock or other securities (equity or otherwise) of the

Assuming that the Authorizations, filings and notifications described in
_Section 5.3_ have been obtained or made, the execution and delivery by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement does not and consummation of the

their respective Subsidiaries, (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws

the Offer and the Top-Up Option, to repay all of the Companys outstanding
indebtedness, other than accrued trade debt which shall be assumed by the
Surviving Company, and to pay all fees and expenses and other amounts related
to the Merger, the Offer and other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement). As of the date hereof, Parent has delivered to the Company true,
correct and complete copies of one or more executed commitment letters,
including exhibits, schedules and amendments thereto (such
letters collectively, the " _Financing Letters_ ") from the financial
institutions identified therein (the " _Financing Sources_ ") with respect to
one or more debt and/or equity financings in the amounts set forth therein for
the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (being

of the Financing Letters has been amended or modified, no such amendment
or modification is contemplated, and the respective obligations and
commitments contained in such letters have not been withdrawn, terminated,
rescinded, amended or modified in any respect. As of the date hereof, Parent
or Merger Subsidiary has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
in connection with the Financing Letters that were payable on or prior to the

all of the Shares of the Company pursuant to the Offer and the Top-Up Option,
(B) to repay all of the Companys outstanding indebtedness other than accrued
trade debt, which shall be assumed by the Surviving Company and (C) to pay all

precedent and/or contingencies to the 

 



46  obligations of the parties set forth in the Financing Letters to enter in to
Financing Agreements, each constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
Parent and Merger Subsidiary, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each other
party thereto, enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms. To
the Knowledge of Parent as of the date hereof, no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be
expected to (i) constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, (ii) to
the Knowledge of Parent, a failure of any condition to the Financing or (iii)
to the Knowledge of Parent otherwise result in any portion of the Financing
being unavailable on the date of the Closing. As of the date hereof, Parent
does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be available
to Parent or Merger Subsidiary in the full contemplated amount thereof on the
date of the Closing. There are no conditions precedent or contingencies to the
obligations of the parties under the Financing Letters to make the full
amount of the Financing available to Parent on the terms therein except as
expressly set forth in the Financing Letters.

53  Proposal which did not result from or arise in connection with a knowing or

modify its recommendation of the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger or the
Agreement in response to the Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement

_Section 4.12_ or which relate to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv) any fact or occurrence between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time of which it has Knowledge which
makes any of its representations contained in this Agreement untrue in any
material respect or causes any material breach of its obligations under this
Agreement.

Parent will take all action necessary (a) to cause Merger Subsidiary to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and to commence the Offer and
the Top-Up Option, if necessary, and consummate the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and, to the extent permitted under the

reasonably practicable following completion of the Offer and (b) to ensure
that, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall not conduct any
business or make any investments other than as specifically contemplated by
this Agreement. Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Subsidiary to,
take any action that would result in the breach of any representation and
warranty of Parent hereunder (except for representations and warranties made
as of a specific date) such that the Company would have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_. This is a guarantee of
payment and performance. Parent hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand
of performance, filing of any claim, any right to require any proceeding
first against Merger Subsidiary or Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
protest, notice and all demands whatsoever in connection with the performance
of its obligations set forth in this _Section 6.5_.

 

6.6 _Director and Officer Liability_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the fullest extent
permitted by Law the present and former officers and directors of the Company
and its Subsidiaries against all losses, claims, damages, fines, penalties and
liability in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time including amounts paid in settlement or compromise with the
approval of the Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,

exculpation and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time now existing in favor of the current and former officers and
directors of the Company as provided in the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws or any agreement set forth in  _Section 6.6_ of the
Companys Disclosure Letter, in each case in effect as of the date hereof,
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and

 



55  effect in accordance with their terms and without amendment thereof. From
the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary thereof, the Parent will
cause Merger Subsidiary to, and Surviving Corporation will, without any lapse
in coverage, provide officers and directors liability insurance in respect
of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such
Person currently covered by the Companys officers and directors liability
insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided,
that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend annual
premiums during such period in excess of 400% of the per annum rate of the
aggregate annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance on
the date of this Agreement, provided that if the annual premium for such
insurance shall exceed such 400% in any year, the Surviving Corporation shall
be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount; provided further that in the event Parent
shall prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, directly or
indirectly, sell all or substantially all of the assets or capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation, prior to such sale, Parent shall either assume such
obligation or cause a Subsidiary of Parent having a net worth substantially
equivalent to, or in excess of the net worth of, the Surviving Corporation
immediately prior to such sale to assume such obligation. Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to reimburse all expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees, incurred by any Person to enforce the obligations of Parent
and Surviving Corporation under this _Section 6.6(a)_.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
the Effective Time the Company shall be permitted to purchase prepaid "tail"
policies in favor of the individuals referred to in _Section 6.6(a)_ with
respect to the matters described therein. If and to the extent such policies
have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in effect and continue to
honor the obligations of the Company thereunder.

 

6.7 _Access and Information_.

 

From the date hereof until the Effective Time, each of the Company and the
Parent will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) afford to the other and
its Representatives appropriate access, at reasonable times upon reasonable
prior notice, to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and
other facilities of the other and to its books, records, contracts and
documents and (ii) furnish promptly to the other and its Representatives such
information concerning its business, properties, contracts, records and
personnel (including financial, operating and other data and information) as
may be reasonably requested, from time to time, by or on behalf of the other
party. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information if such access or disclosure
would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, suppliers or
employees, infringe on a third-party confidentiality obligation, jeopardize
the work product privilege or the attorney-client privilege of the institution
in possession or control of such information, compromise the value of any
trade secret, or contravene any Law (including antitrust laws), fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement.
Additionally, the Company makes no representation or warranty as to the
accuracy of information provided pursuant to this _Section 6.7_, and neither
Parent nor Merger Subsidiary may rely on the accuracy of such information,
other than as expressly set forth in the Companys representations and
warranties set forth in _Article IV_ herein.

including the Company Approvals and the Parent Approvals, from Governmental

impede the receipt of any necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents,
clearances, approvals, and expirations or terminations of waiting periods,
including the Company Approvals and the Parent Approvals, from Governmental
Authorities.

6.11 _Public Announcements_.

 

The initial press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement
shall be a joint press release reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Company. Until the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will consult with
each other before issuing any press release or making any public statement
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and,
except as may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with the
Stock Exchange will not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation except as may be required by applicable
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the party
wanting to make such release or announcement; provided, that the Company shall
not be required to obtain the prior written approval of Parent in connection
with any press release or public announcement that the Company Board has made
an adverse recommendation change based on a Superior Proposal or resolved to
do so.

 

6.12 _Defense of Litigation_.

 

The Company shall control, and the Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense of any litigation brought by stockholders of
the Company against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



58   _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not settle or offer to
settle any claim, action, suit, charge, investigation or proceeding against
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or
officers by any stockholder of the Company arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
written consent of Parent. The Company shall not cooperate with any Person
that may seek to restrain, enjoin, prohibit or otherwise oppose the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company shall cooperate
with Parent and Merger Subsidiary in resisting any such effort to
restrain, enjoin, prohibit or otherwise oppose such transactions.

6.13 _State Takeover Statutes_.

 

If any State takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company and their
respective Boards of Directors shall (a) take all reasonable action to ensure
that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b)
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such takeover statute or
Law.

 

6.14 _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_.

 

Prior to the Acceptance Time and to the extent permitted by Law, the Company
(acting through its Board of Directors, compensation committee or its
independent directors, to the extent required) will take all such steps as may
be required to cause each agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into
by the Company or its Subsidiaries on or after the date hereof with any of the
Covered Securityholders pursuant to which compensation is paid to such
officer, director or employee to be approved as an "employment compensation,
severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule
14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act and to otherwise satisfy the requirements
of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the
Exchange Act.

 

6.15 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From the Acceptance Date through the Effective Time, Parent shall permit
the Company to continue the employment, compensation and benefits of its
employees on the same or substantially similar terms and conditions in all
material respects as are in effect as of the date of this Agreement. From and
after the Effective Time, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary of
the Surviving Corporation shall permit all employees to participate in the
Benefit Plans, programs, and arrangements of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or its Subsidiaries (the " _Parent Plans_ ") to the same extent as similarly
situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, subject to any necessary
transition period and subject to any applicable Laws.

(b) For all purposes under each Benefit Plan maintained by Parent, any Parent
Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates in which Continuing Employees become
eligible to participate upon or after the Effective Time, the Continuing
Employees shall be given credit for all service with the Company or a Company
Subsidiary, as applicable, to the same extent as if such services had been
rendered to Parent or any of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
such credit shall not be used to determine benefit accruals, except with
respect to severance, vacation benefits and any other paid time off benefits.

 



59 (c) As to the plan years then in place at the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to use all reasonable best efforts to:
(i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions, evidence
of insurability requirements and waiting periods with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees under any
welfare or fringe Benefit Plan in which the Continuing Employees may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time; and (ii) provide each
Continuing Employee with credit under any general leave, welfare plan or
fringe Benefit Plan in which the Continuing Employee becomes eligible to
participate after the Effective Time for any co-payments and deductibles paid
by and out of pocket requirements satisfied by such Continuing Employee
for the then current plan year under the corresponding welfare or fringe
Benefit Plan maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 6.15_ is not intended to and
shall not require Parent to continue any Company Benefit Plan beyond the time
when it otherwise lawfully could be terminated or modified, or to provide any
Continuing Employee with any rights to continued employment, severance pay or
similar benefits following any termination of employment except as provided
under the terms of the applicable Benefit Plan.

(e) Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this  _Section 6.16_,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay severance
benefits to persons who were employees of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and whose employment with
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries is terminated within one (1) year following the Effective Time in
amounts no less favorable than the amount of severance benefits to which such
persons would have been entitled under the terms of the Companys or the
Companys Subsidiaries Severance Plan, programs, policies, employment
agreements and other agreements in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time and, for this purpose, also taking into account the employment service
of such employees after the Effective Time.

6.16 _Amendment of Stock Options and Stock Awards_.

As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause each issued and outstanding option and
Company Restricted Share granted under the Company Stock Plans to be amended
to permit the acceleration and vesting of such options and Company Restricted
Shares immediately prior to the Acceptance Date as provided in  _Section
3.8_ hereof to the extent such options and Company Restricted Shares do not
permit such treatment; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company
provide any benefit or consideration to the holder of any such option
or Company Restricted Shares in obtaining such amendment or take any other
action prohibited in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under Rule 14d-10 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



60 6.17 _Rule 16b-3_.

 

Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company shall each take all such reasonable
steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by _Articles
II_ and _III_ and any other dispositions of Equity Securities of the Company
(including Company Options and Company Restricted Shares) by each individual
who is subject or at the Effective Time will be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

6.18 _Financing_.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the Financing described in the Financing Letters on the terms and
conditions described therein including using reasonable best efforts (i) to
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing
Letters on the terms and contained in the Financing Letters, and (ii) to
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding in the Financing Letters
and such definitive agreements thereto (other than any condition where the
failure to be so satisfied is a direct result of the Companys failure to
furnish information described in _Section 6.18(b)_) and to consummate the
Financing at or prior to the Closing. In the event that any portion of the
Financing becomes unavailable so as not to enable Parent and Merger
Subsidiary to proceed with the Merger and related transactions in a timely
manner, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use their reasonable best efforts
to arrange to obtain alternate financing from alternative sources on
comparable or more favorable terms (to Parent and Merger Subsidiary) than
those set forth in the Financing Letters as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event, including entering into definitive agreements
with respect thereto (such definitive agreements entered into pursuant to
either the Financing Letters or such alternate financing being referred to as
the " _Financing Agreements_ "). Any material breach of any of the Financing
Letters, the Financing Agreements, any alternate financing commitment and any
related fee and engagement letters by Parent or Merger Subsidiary shall be
deemed a breach by Parent of this _Section 6.18(a)_. Parent shall (i) furnish
complete, correct and executed copies of the Financing Agreements to the
Company promptly upon their execution, (ii) give the Company prompt notice (x)
of any breach by any party of, or material dispute or disagreement between any
of the parties to, the Financing Letters, any alternate financing commitment
or the Financing Agreements of which Parent or Merger Subsidiary becomes aware
or any termination thereof or (y) if for any reason Parent or Merger
Subsidiary believes in good faith that it is reasonably likely that it will
not be able to obtain all or any material portion of the Financing in the
amounts or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Letters and that it
is not reasonably likely that it will be able to obtain acceptable
alternative financing prior to the Termination Date and (iii) otherwise keep
the Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing (or any replacements thereof).

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to provide to Parent and Merger Subsidiary, at Parents sole expense,
all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is customary or necessary
in connection with arranging, obtaining and syndicating the Financing,
including without limitation, (i) furnishing Parent, Merger Subsidiary and
their Financing Sources, as promptly as reasonably practicable, with

 



61  financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as may reasonably be requested in writing by Parent and
identifying any portion of such information that constitutes material non-
public information, (ii) in each case upon reasonable notice and in reasonably
convenient locations, making senior management of the Company available to
participate in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows,
due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with prospective
lenders, investors and rating agencies in connection with the Financing, (iii)
assisting with the preparation of customary materials for rating agency
presentations (and assisting in the obtaining of corporate, credit and
facility ratings from ratings agencies), offering documents, private placement
memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and all other material to
be used in connection with the financing (including customary authorization
and management representation letters) and all documentation and other
information required in connection with applicable "know your customer" and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including U.S.A. Patriot Act of
2001, (iv) using reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants comfort
letters as reasonably requested by Parent, (v) entering into one or more
credit or other agreements on terms reasonably satisfactory to Parent and
Merger Subsidiary in connection with such Financing immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time, (vi) taking all corporate actions, subject to and only
effective upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, required to permit the
consummation of the financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made
available to the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time,
and (vii) otherwise taking actions within its control to cooperate in
satisfying the conditions precedent set forth in any Financing Agreements;
provided, however, that (A) no obligation of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries under the Financing Agreements shall be effective until the
Effective Time, (B) nothing in this _Section 6.18(b)_ shall require such
cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (C) neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment fee or incur any
liability that is not contingent upon the Closing (or, without limitation of
the foregoing, execute any Financing Agreements (except the authorization
letter delivered pursuant to the foregoing clause (iii)) prior to the Closing
or any other agreement, certificate, document or instrument that would be
effective prior to the Closing), (D) in no event shall the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries be required to make any representations or
warranties regarding Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their respective Affiliates
and (E) none of the boards of directors (or equivalent bodies) of the Company
or any of its Subsidiary shall be required to enter into any resolutions or
take similar action approving the Financing. Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses (including attorneys fees), interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred in connection with this _Section 6.18(b)_.
Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys fees)
incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with this _Section
6.18(b)_. Parent shall cause all non-public or confidential information
provided by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant
to this _Section 6.18(b)_ to be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of the Companys logos in
connection with the Financing in a form and manner mutually agreed with the
Company; provided, however, that such logos are used solely in a manner that
is not intended, or reasonably likely, to harm or disparage the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 



62 (d) Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of
the Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing
and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the
Financing or any alternative financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VII.

ARTICLE VII.

Date is established pursuant to an authorized extension of the Offer;

(d) by Parent prior to the Acceptance Date, if:

 

(i) there shall have been a breach of any representation or warranty on the
part of the Company set forth in this Agreement or if any representation or
warranty of the Company shall have become untrue in either case such that the
condition set forth in paragraph 2(b) of _Annex A_ would not be satisfied or
would be incapable of being satisfied by the earlier of (A) twenty (20) days
following receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach or (B) the
End Date; _provided_ , that at the time of the delivery of such written
notice, Parent shall not be in material breach of its obligations under this
Agreement;

(ii) there shall have been a breach or breaches by the Company of its

its obligations under _Section 6.3_ (it being understood and agreed that
any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the Companys stockholders of the
nature contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act shall not be deemed
to constitute a withdrawal or modification of such recommendation).

 

The right of any party hereto to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1_ shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless
of any investigation made by or on

 



65  behalf of any party hereto, any Person controlling any such party or any of
their respective officers, directors, representatives or agents, whether prior
to or after the execution of this Agreement.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, subject to the
payment of fees to the extent required by  _Section 8.3_ of this Agreement,
this Agreement (but not the Confidentiality Agreement) shall become void and
of no effect with no liability on the part of any party (or any stockholder or
Representative of such party) to the other party hereto; provided that, if
such termination shall result from the willful (i) failure of a party to
fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations of the other
parties, (ii) failure of a party to perform a material covenant hereof, or
(iii) breach by a party hereto of any representation or warranty or agreement
contained herein, such party shall be fully liable for any and all liabilities
and damages incurred or suffered by the other parties as a result of
such willful failure or breach; provided further, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section 8.3_
and _Article IX_ shall survive any termination hereof.

8.3 _Termination Fees; Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 8.3_, whether or not the
Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) (A) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to the
Company, the Board, or senior management of the Company, or shall have been
made directly to the stockholders of the Company or any Person shall have
publicly announced a bona fide intention (not subsequently withdrawn) to make
an Acquisition Proposal and (B) following the occurrence of an event
described in the preceding clause (A), this Agreement is terminated by the
Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ at a time when Parent would
have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section
8.1(d)(i)_ or _8.1(d)(ii)_ and (C) the Company consummates an Acquisition
Proposal, within nine (9) months of the date this Agreement is terminated
(provided that for purposes of this _Section 8.3(b)(i)_, the references to
"20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "50%"); or

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_; or

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(iii)_.

 

then in any such event under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this _Section
8.3(b)_, the Company shall pay to Parent or an Affiliate of Parent designated
in writing by Parent (" _Payee_ ") a termination fee of $3.5 million in cash
(the " _Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event shall the

 



66  Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
Any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (i) of Section 8.3(b) shall
be made to Payee on the date an Acquisition Proposal is consummated. Any
payment required to be made pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of _Section
8.3(b)_ shall be made to Payee concurrently with, and as a condition to the
effectiveness of, the termination of this Agreement; and in each case such
payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account to be designated by Parent. In the event that Parent shall receive the
Termination Fee, the receipt of such fee shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent,
Merger Subsidiary, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the
transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary,
any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against the Company
or any of its Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such
termination.

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(i)_, then Parent shall promptly, but in no event later than
two business days after the date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid
to the Company by wire transfer of same day funds (it being understood that in
no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more
than one occasion) a termination fee of $5.5 million in cash (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ "). In the event that the Company shall receive the Parent
Termination Fee, the receipt of such fee shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
the Company, any of its respective Affiliates or any other Person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions
contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the
basis for such termination, and none of the Company, any of its respective
Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
other claim, action or proceeding against the Parent, the Merger Subsidiary
or any of their Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such
termination, including those under Section 6.18 hereof.

EXECUTION VERSION  SIGNATURE PAGE  _ANNEX A_

 

 _CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER_

 

Capitalized terms used in this _Annex A_ and not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement to which it is
attached (the " _Merger Agreement_ ").

1\. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the Merger Agreement,
Merger Subsidiary shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to
any applicable rules and Regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under
the Exchange Act, to pay for any Shares tendered in connection with the Offer
and, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, may terminate or amend the
Offer, unless, immediately prior to the Expiration Date, there shall have been
validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn that number of
Shares, which, together with the number of Shares, if any, then owned
beneficially by Parent, Merger Subsidiary and any Subsidiary or Affiliate of
Parent or Merger Subsidiary, taken as a whole, constitutes at least a majority
of the issued and outstanding equity of the Company on a fully-diluted basis,
assuming the exercise of all options, warrants and other rights to purchase
Shares regardless of exercise price, vesting schedule or other terms or
conditions thereof, other than any such options, warrants or other rights
that would be cashed out pursuant to Sections 3.8(a)  (c) (the " _Minimum
Tender Condition_ ").

2. Additionally, notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the
Merger Agreement, Merger Subsidiary shall not be required to accept for
payment or, subject to any applicable rules and Regulations of the SEC,
including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, to pay for any Shares
tendered in connection with the Offer and, subject to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, including _Section 2.1_, may terminate or amend the Offer if any
of the following conditions exist:

 

(a) any order, decree, injunction or ruling restraining or enjoining or
otherwise materially delaying or preventing the acceptance for payment of, or
the payment for, some or all of the Shares or otherwise prohibiting
consummation of the Offer shall have been issued by a Governmental Authority
or any statute, rule or Regulation shall have been enacted that prohibits or
makes illegal the acceptance for payment of, or the payment for, some or all
of the Shares;

(b) (A) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Section 4.3(a), Section 4.4(a) or Section 4.7, without giving effect to
materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifications, shall not be
true and correct in all material respects at and as of immediately prior to
the expiration of the Offer as if made at and as of such time (other than such
representations and warranties that by their terms address matters only as of
another specified time, which shall be true and correct in all
material respects only as of such time) and (B) all of the remaining
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement,
without giving effect to materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect"
qualifications shall not be true and correct at and as of immediately prior
to the expiration of the Offer as if made at and as of such time (other than
such representations and warranties that by their terms address matters only
as of another   specified time, which shall be true and correct only as of such time)
except, with respect to this clause (B), where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(c) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its covenants or obligations to be performed or complied with
by it under the Agreement prior to the Expiration Date;

 

(d) the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate signed by
an executive officer of the Company dated as of the date on which the Offer
expires certifying that the conditions specified in the foregoing clauses (b)
and (c) do not exist;

(e) since the date of the Merger Agreement, any fact(s), circumstance(s),
event(s), change(s), effect(s) or occurrence(s) shall have occurred, other
than as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, which has or have had,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(f) prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Board shall
have withdrawn, modified or changed in a manner adverse to Parent and
Subsidiary, its recommendation of the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement; or

(g) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

The conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this _Annex A_ are for the
benefit of Parent and Merger Subsidiary and, regardless of the circumstances,
may be asserted by Parent or Merger Subsidiary in whole or in part at any
applicable time or from time to time prior to the Expiration Date, except that
the conditions relating to receipt of any approvals from any Governmental
Authority may be asserted at any time prior to the acceptance for payment of
Shares, and all conditions (except for the Minimum Tender Condition) may be
waived by Parent or Merger Subsidiary in its discretion in whole or in part
at any applicable time or from time to time, in each case subject to the terms
and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the applicable rules and
Regulations of the SEC. The failure of Parent or Merger Subsidiary at any
time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of
any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may
be asserted at any time and from time to time.
