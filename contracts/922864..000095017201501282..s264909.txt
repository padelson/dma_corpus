aggregate of the product of (x) the Common Per Share Value of AIMCO Common
Stock and (y) the number of shares of AIMCO Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to Section 2.2(a). The "Common Per Share Value" shall equal the
lower of (i) the mean between the highest and lowest quoted selling prices

                  (e) CASDEN I AND II WARRANTS. At the Effective Time, each
then outstanding, unexercised Casden I Warrant and Casden II Warrant which
has been amended pursuant to Section 7.28 shall, in accordance with its
terms, as amended, and by virtue of this Agreement and without any further
action of Casden, AIMCO or the holder of such warrant, terminate.

NYSE trading day prior to the anticipated Closing Date (the "Test Date")
the Common Per Share Value of AIMCO Common Stock is such that if the
Closing were to occur on the Test Date the provisions of Section 2.2(d)
would require an adjustment to the consideration otherwise payable under
Section 2.2(a), then Casden shall have the right to elect, in its sole
discretion (or, alternatively, AIC in his sole discretion), to restructure
the Merger as a reverse subsidiary merger. In the event Casden or AIC
notifies AIMCO in writing, not later than the day following the Test Date,
that it or he has determined to make the election permitted by this Section
2.2(f) (a "Taxable Election"), AIMCO shall form a new, wholly-owned
subsidiary corporation ("New Merger Sub") solely for the purpose of merging

be effected by the merger of New Merger Sub with and into Casden in
accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, with Casden as the
surviving corporation; (ii) all references to the term "Merger" shall be
deemed references to the merger contemplated by this Section 2.2(f); (iii)
all references to the term "Surviving Corporation" shall be deemed
references to Casden; (iv) at the Effective Time, the charter and bylaws of
New Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
be the Charter and bylaws, respectively, of the surviving corporation and
the directors and officers of New Merger Sub shall be the directors and
officers of the surviving corporation; (v) the provisions of Section 2.2(d)
shall have no further force and effect, and in the Merger each holder of
Casden Capital Stock will receive the consideration such holder would have
received pursuant to Section 2.2 without application of Section 2.2(d);
(vi) the covenants set forth in Section 7.19 and the condition set forth in
Section 8.3(d) shall thereafter cease to apply; and (vii) except as
expressly provided in this Section 2.2(f), all terms, conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect;
provided, however, that in the event the Common Per Share Value is less
than $36 on the Test Date, a Taxable Election shall automatically, and
without any action of any party hereto, be deemed to have been made. The
parties shall cooperate to implement such reverse subsidiary merger
structure in the event a Taxable Election is made (or is deemed to have
been made pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence). If a Taxable
Election is made pursuant to this Section 2.2(f), the parties hereto
covenant and agree that the transaction effected pursuant to this Agreement
shall be treated by the parties as a sale of the shares of Casden acquired
by AIMCO hereunder for all income tax purposes and that the parties shall
treat such transaction consistent therewith on all income tax returns and
filings. No election provided under Section 338 of the Code shall be made
with respect to this transaction without the prior written consent of all
the shareholders of Casden prior to the Merger.

                  (g) CONSIDERATION ALLOCATION. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement or in any Related Transaction Documents to the
contrary, at any time prior to the Effective Time, Casden may modify the
allocation of the Aggregate Consideration among the REIT Common
Consideration, the REIT Common Deferred Consideration, the REIT Preferred
Consideration, the OP Contribution Consideration, the CPLB Merger
Consideration and the Casden Contribution Consideration, and may reallocate
the REIT Merger Consideration among and with respect to all recipients
thereof, and may in connection therewith adjust the deemed $21.66 in
Section 2.2(c), by giving written notice of such revised allocation(s) to
AIMCO without the consent or approval of any Casden stockholder or any
other party hereto, provided however that (i) neither the Aggregate
Consideration nor the aggregate amount of Deferred Consideration may be
increased, (ii) Casden may not modify the allocation of the Aggregate
Consideration in any way that increases the aggregate number of shares of
AIMCO Common Stock and AIMCO OP Units to be issued in the Transactions
without the prior written consent of AIMCO and (iii) Casden may not modify
the Aggregate Consideration without appropriate approval of the board of
directors and independent directors of Casden. At least three (3) business
days before the Effective Time, Casden shall provide AIMCO with written
notice of its determination of its allocation in respect of the Villa Azure

Amortization.

         Section 2.3       PAYMENT OF MERGER CONSIDERATION.

                  (a) EXCHANGE FUND. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, AIMCO shall hold, in trust for the benefit of holders of
Certificates, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate cash
portion of the REIT Merger Consideration plus the option payout and warrant
payout amounts and (ii) the cash payable in respect of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.3(d) (collectively, the "Exchange Fund"). The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

                  (b) PAYMENT PROCEDURES.

                           (i) Prior to the Effective Time, AIMCO (or any
agent or agents appointed by AIMCO) shall deliver to each holder of record
(identified on Schedule 4.2(c) of the Casden Disclosure Letter) of a
certificate or certificates (a "Certificate" or the "Certificates") which
immediately prior to the Effective Time will represent outstanding shares
of Casden Capital Stock (the "Canceled Shares") that will be canceled and
become instead a portion of the Closing Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.2(a): (w) an investor representation letter in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit T, (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Certificates to AIMCO), and
(y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for that portion of the REIT Merger Consideration payable with
respect to such shares. Casden hereby acknowledges that AIMCO shall rely
solely on Section 4.2(c) of the Casden Disclosure Letter as to the holders
of record to whom the foregoing should be delivered.

                           (ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate to AIMCO
for cancellation (or to such agent or agents as may be appointed by AIMCO),
together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and a duly executed
certificate of non-foreign status in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
Q-1 or Exhibit Q-2, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive with respect to the shares of Casden Capital Stock formerly
represented thereby (in addition to any Deferred Consideration to which
such holder may be entitled under the Tri-Party Agreement, if applicable),
(A) a certificate or certificates representing that number of whole shares
of AIMCO Common Stock into which such holder's Casden Capital Stock was
converted pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.2, (B) the amount of cash
which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.2 and (C)
cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 2.3(d).

                           (iii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Canceled Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of Casden,
that portion of the REIT Merger Consideration into which such holder's
Casden Capital Stock was converted in the Merger may be issued to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such Canceled Shares is
surrendered to AIMCO, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence satisfactory to AIMCO that any
applicable share transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.3(b) or as otherwise provided in Section
2.3(e), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender a portion
of the REIT Merger Consideration.

                           (iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect
to any holder of a Certificate who presents any Certificate to AIMCO on or
prior to the Closing Date, together with a duly executed letter of
transmittal and such other documents as AIMCO shall reasonably require,
AIMCO shall deliver to such holder, on the Closing Date, all of that
portion of the REIT Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled
with respect to such Certificate.

                  (c) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO SHARES. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, all dividends or other distributions
declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to shares of AIMCO
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid into
an escrow account for the benefit of the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of AIMCO Common Stock represented
thereby, and no cash amount or cash payment in lieu of fractional shares
shall be paid to any such holder until the holder of such Certificate shall
surrender such Certificate, at which time all proceeds in escrow for the
benefit of such surrendering holder shall be released to such surrendering
holder as though such shares of AIMCO Common Stock had been issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time. Subject to the effect of unclaimed
property, escheat and other applicable laws, following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of AIMCO Common Stock issued in consideration
therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
applicable cash amount payable pursuant to Section 2.2(a), any cash payable
in lieu of fractional shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.3(d) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid into escrow with
respect to such whole shares of AIMCO Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a
payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of AIMCO Common Stock.

                  (d) NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. No scrip representing
fractional shares of AIMCO Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger and
no dividend or other distribution, stock split or interest shall relate to
any such fractional share, and such fractional share shall not entitle the
owner thereof to any voting or other rights of a stockholder of AIMCO. In
lieu of any fractional share of AIMCO Common Stock to which a holder of
Casden Capital Stock would otherwise be entitled, upon surrender of a
Certificate representing Casden Capital Stock as described in this Section,
such holder shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the
product of (i) the AIMCO Common Stock Price multiplied by (ii) the fraction
of a share of AIMCO Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled. AIMCO shall make available to AIMCO the amount of cash necessary
to make such payments without regard to any other cash being provided to
AIMCO.

                  (e) BOOK ENTRY. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the letter of transmittal referred to in Section 2.3(b)
may, at the option of AIMCO, provide for the right of a holder of one or
more Certificates to elect that any shares of AIMCO Common Stock into which
such holder's AIMCO Common Stock was converted in the Merger be in
uncertificated form.

                  (f) CLOSING OF TRANSFER BOOKS; ETC. From and after the
Effective Time, the Casden stock transfer books shall be closed and no
registration of any transfer of any capital stock of Casden shall
thereafter be made on the Casden stock transfer books. If Certificates are
presented to AIMCO after the Effective Time they shall be canceled and
exchanged for (i) certificates representing the appropriate number of
shares of AIMCO Common Stock, (ii) the applicable cash amount payable
pursuant to Section 2.2(a), and (iii) cash in lieu of fractional shares and
dividends and other distributions, as provided in Sections 2.3(c) and
2.3(d). Shares of AIMCO Common Stock into which Canceled Shares are
converted in the Merger shall be outstanding as of the Effective Time.
AIMCO shall cause all such shares of AIMCO Common Stock to be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and not subject
to preemptive rights. In the event any Certificate(s) shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by AIMCO, upon the provision by such Person of an
unsecured indemnity against any claim that may be made against AIMCO with
respect to such Certificate(s), AIMCO will deliver in respect of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate(s), a certificate representing the AIMCO
Common Stock into which the shares of Casden Common Stock represented by
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate(s) were converted in the Merger
and the applicable cash amount payable pursuant to Section 2.2(a) and cash
in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.3(d) and such
Person shall be entitled to the voting, dividend and other distribution
rights provided herein with respect thereto.

                  (g) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. All unclaimed cash in
the Exchange Fund on the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be
retained by AIMCO, and thereafter, any holder of unsurrendered Certificates
shall look only to AIMCO for payment of such funds and the delivery of
certificates representing shares of AIMCO Common Stock to which such holder
may be due, subject to applicable law as described in the following
sentence. AIMCO shall not be liable to any Person for such shares or funds
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

         Section 2.4       APPRAISAL RIGHTS. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted
into or exchangeable for the right to receive any portion of the REIT
Merger Consideration, but shall be entitled to receive cash consideration
as shall be determined pursuant to Sections 3-203 through 3-213 of the
MGCL; provided, however, that if a holder of Casden Common Stock or Casden
Class A Preferred Stock fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses
the right to appraisal and payment under the MGCL, each share of such
Casden Capital Stock of such holder shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into and become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the
right to receive any portion of the REIT Merger Consideration, assuming
that such shares were shares of Other Common Stock, and such shares shall
no longer be Dissenting Shares. Casden shall give prompt notice to AIMCO of
any written demands received by Casden for appraisal of Casden Common Stock
or Casden Class A Preferred Stock and any objections to the Merger received
prior to the Merger and AIMCO shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations with respect to such demands or objections.

                                THE CLOSING

         Section 3.1       CLOSING. The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher

90071 at 10:00 A.M., local time, on January 31, 2002 or earlier following
the third NYSE trading day immediately following the date on which the last
of the conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof is fulfilled or has been
waived or at such other time, date and place as AIMCO and Casden shall
mutually agree (the "Closing Date"); provided, however, that in the event
the Closing does not occur on or before December 31, 2001, AIMCO and Casden
shall determine a mutually agreeable Closing Date that would not adversely
affect Casden's REIT status for the taxable year ending on the Closing
Date. The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to close on or
prior to January 31, 2002.

Material Adverse Effect. Casden OP has all requisite partnership power and
authority, and has been duly authorized by all necessary approvals and
orders to own, lease and operate its assets and properties to the extent

of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Casden Material
Adverse Effect. Copies of the charter and bylaws or similar organizational
and governing documents and copies of the partnership, joint venture and
operating agreements of each Casden Subsidiary, each as amended to the date

Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of November 1, 2001, the name and state of
organization of, and ownership interest in, each Person of which National
Partnership Investments Corp. ("NAPICO") or one of its Subsidiaries is a
direct or indirect general partner (other than any Person (i) in which
NAPICO is an administrative general partner and does not control the
day-to-day operations of such Person, (ii) which does not operate, has not

than Liens described in Section 4.1(b) of the Casden Disclosure Letter).
Each of the NAPICO Entities is an entity validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or
leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Casden Material Adverse Effect. To Casden's knowledge,
all outstanding ownership interests in the NAPICO Entities and each Person
in which the NAPICO Entities hold an ownership interest have been validly
issued. Copies of the organizational and governing documents of each NAPICO
Entity, as amended to the date of this Agreement, have been previously

commercial lease for all or a portion of such Commercial Property), and
such assets and liabilities will not be assets or liabilities of Casden or
any Casden Subsidiary at the Effective Time, nor will title to such
Commercial Properties directly or indirectly pass to AIMCO or any Affiliate
of AIMCO in connection with the Merger.

                  (g) RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES. As a result of the Merger,
and assuming the receipt of all AIMCO Statutory Approvals and Casden
Statutory Approvals, AIMCO will succeed to all of the assets of Casden

Effect. Except as set forth in Section 4.9 or Section 4.11 of the Casden
Disclosure Letter, Casden and the Casden Subsidiaries have all permits,
licenses (including licenses required to operate as a property manager),
franchises and other governmental authorizations, consents and approvals
necessary to conduct their businesses as presently conducted, except where
the failure to obtain such permits, licenses (including licenses required
to operate as a property manager), franchises and other authorizations,
consents and approvals would not reasonably be expected to have a Casden
Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Section 4.3(d), Section 4.6
or Section 4.8 of the Casden Disclosure Letter, neither Casden nor any
Casden Subsidiary is in breach or violation of or in default in the
performance or observance of any term or provision of, and no event has

organizational documents or (ii) any Contract (other than any
organizational documents or loan agreements, notes and mortgages with
respect to non-residential properties) to which Casden or any Casden
Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound or to which its property is
subject, except for possible Violations which individually or in the
aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Casden Material
Adverse Effect.

Subsidiaries, (iv) there have not been any significant adverse developments
since December 31, 2000 with respect to such disclosed claims, suits,
actions, proceedings, investigations or reviews and (v) there are no
judgments, decrees, injunctions, or orders of any Governmental Authority
specifically applicable to Casden or any Casden Subsidiary which would, if

Section 4.6(ii) of the Casden Disclosure Letter.

         Section 4.7       TAX MATTERS. Except as set forth in Section 4.7
of the Casden Disclosure Letter:

Casden Subsidiaries have filed (or there have been filed on such Persons'
behalf) all federal and all material foreign, state and local Tax Returns
required to be filed by each of them under applicable law. All such Tax
Returns were and are in all material respects true, complete and correct
and filed on a timely basis (after giving effect to any filing extension
properly granted by a Governmental Authority having the authority to do
so).

                  (b) PAYMENT OF TAXES. Casden and each of the Casden
Subsidiaries have paid all material Taxes that are currently due and
payable for all periods through and including the Closing Date within the
time and in the manner prescribed by law, except for those Taxes contested
in good faith and for which adequate reserves have been provided on their
books and records and except for the tax under Section 857(b)(5) of the
Code on Casden's federal income tax return for the year 2000 for which a
cash reserve in the amount of such liability has been established.

                  (c) TAX RESERVES. Casden and the Casden Subsidiaries have
established on their books and records reserves adequate to pay all
material Taxes and reserves for deferred income Taxes in accordance with
GAAP.

                  (d) TAX LIENS. There are no Tax liens upon the material

Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with the provisions of
the Code relating to the withholding of Taxes, as well as similar
provisions under any other laws, and have withheld and paid over to the
proper Governmental Authorities all amounts required within the time and in
the manner prescribed by law.

                  (f) REIT CLASSIFICATION. At all times since December 30,
1998, Casden has been organized and operated in conformity with the
requirements necessary to qualify as a REIT pursuant to Section 856 of the
Code (the "Status Requirements"), and the execution or delivery by Casden
of this Agreement and the consummation by Casden of the Transactions or
compliance with or fulfillment of the terms and provisions hereof by
Casden, will not adversely affect the qualification of Casden as a REIT for
each taxable year ending on or before the Closing Date.

                  (g) AUDIT, ADMINISTRATIVE AND COURT PROCEEDINGS. No
audits or other administrative or court proceedings are presently pending
with regard to any material Taxes or Tax Returns of Casden or any of the
Casden Subsidiaries.

                  (h) TAX RULINGS. Except for the rulings previously
delivered by Casden to AIMCO and the Closing Agreement with the IRS

NAPICO Entities) has been or will be subject to tax (i) under the
principles of Section 1374, as described in IRS Notice 88-19 and Temporary
Treasury Reg. Section 1.337(d)-5T, or (ii) under paragraphs (4), (5), (6)
or (7) of Section 857(b) of the Code.

                  (k) PAST DISTRIBUTIONS. With respect to the taxable year
ending on the Closing Date, Casden will have distributed to its
stockholders, in distributions qualifying for the dividends paid deduction
pursuant to Section 857(b)(2)(B) of the Code, an amount equal to 100% of
its real estate investment trust taxable income as described in Section
857(b) of the Code.

                  (l) ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTIONS. If the Merger were not to
occur, neither Casden nor CPLB would be required to make a distribution to
stockholders pursuant to Section 858 or Section 860 of the Code in order to
maintain their status as a REIT.

                  (m) TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES. Each entity
identified as a "Taxable REIT Subsidiary" of Casden (within the meaning of
Section 856(l) of the Code) on Section 4.1(c) of the Casden Disclosure
Letter at all times since January 1, 2001 has satisfied every requirement
imposed by Section 856(1) of the Code. None of such entities (i) operates
or manages, has operated or managed, or will operate or manage prior to the
Closing Date a "lodging facility" or "health care facility" within the
meaning of Section 856(1)(4)(A) and 856(1)(4)(B) of the Code, respectively,
or (ii) licenses, has licensed, or will license prior to the Closing Date,
rights to any brand name under which any such lodging facility or health
care facility is operated.

the Casden Subsidiaries has any material liability for Taxes of any Person
other than Casden and the Casden Subsidiaries (i) under Treasury Reg.
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law),
(ii) by Contract, or (iii) otherwise.

                  (o) SECTION 341(f). Neither Casden nor any of the
Casden Subsidiaries has, with regard to any assets or property held or
acquired by any of them, filed a consent to the application of Section
341(f)(2) of the Code, or agreed to have Section 341(f)(2) of the Code
apply to any disposition of a "subsection (f) asset" (as such term is
defined in Section 341(f)(4) of the Code) owned by Casden or any of the
Casden Subsidiaries.

                  (p) DEFICIENCIES. No deficiencies for any Taxes have
been proposed, asserted or assessed against Casden, or any Casden
Subsidiary, and there is no outstanding waiver of the statute of
limitations with respect to any Taxes or Tax Returns of Casden or any
Casden Subsidiary.

                  (q) TEN PERCENT VOTING INTEREST. At the Closing
Date, other than a corporation that is a "Qualified REIT Subsidiary" of
Casden within the meaning of Section 856(i)(2) of the Code or a "Taxable
REIT Subsidiary" of Casden within the meaning of Section 856(l) of the
Code, neither Casden nor any Casden Subsidiary (excluding, for purposes of
this provision, NAPICO and the NAPICO Entities) will own (as determined for
purposes of Section 856 of the Code and the Regulations promulgated
thereunder, including Treasury Reg. Section 1.856-3(g) and with the same
meaning as when used in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended),

within the meaning of Section 856(c)(5)(B) of the Code) possessing more
than 10% of the total voting power of any issuer or (ii) securities (other
than "real estate assets" within the meaning of Section 856(c)(5)(B) of the
Code) having a value of more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding
securities of any issuer, other than securities satisfying the straight
debt safe harbor of Section 856(c)(7) of the Code.

                  (r) SERVICES. At no time on or prior to the Closing
Date, has Casden or any of the Casden Subsidiaries provided services to
tenants other than services that (i) do not give rise to "impermissible
tenant service income" as defined in Section 856(d)(7) of the Code or (ii)
give rise to impermissible tenant service income with respect to any
property for any taxable year in an amount not in excess of one percent of
all amounts received or accrued by Casden and the Casden Subsidiaries
(excluding, for purposes of this provision, NAPICO) with respect to such
property during such year.

                  (s) OWNERSHIP OF CORPORATIONS. Neither Casden nor
any Casden Subsidiary owns or has owned, directly or indirectly (including

meaning of Section 856(l) of the Code, (iii) NAPICO, prior to its election
to be treated as a "Taxable REIT Subsidiary" of Casden within the meaning

other than through its ownership of NAPICO or a NAPICO Entity, an interest
in a partnership or limited liability company in which Casden was not the
direct or indirect (including through attribution under the Code) managing
member or general partner.

         Section 4.8       EMPLOYEE MATTERS; ERISA. As of the date hereof,
except as set forth in Section 4.8 of the Casden Disclosure Letter and as
contemplated under Section 6.1(h) of the Casden Disclosure Letter:

                  (a) BENEFIT PLANS. Section 4.8(a) of the Casden
Disclosure Letter contains a true and complete list of each written or oral
material employment agreement, arrangement, commitment, severance agreement
or plan, change in control, or retention agreement, bonus plan, incentive
compensation or deferred compensation plan, stock option plan or agreement,
stock-based incentive plan, profit sharing plan, restricted stock plan or
agreement, welfare plan, employee benefit plan (within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA")), policy, program, agreement or arrangement and any
related trust covering any current or former officer, director, agent,
consultant or employee of Casden, any Casden Subsidiary or any trade or
business, whether or not incorporated, that together with Casden or any
Casden Subsidiary would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of
Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA (each, an "ERISA Affiliate") or their
respective beneficiaries with respect to which AIMCO will have financial
obligations following the Merger (collectively, the "Casden Benefit
Plans"). Since December 31, 2000, except as set forth in Section 4.8(a) of
the Casden Disclosure Letter, there have been no new plans, policies,
agreements or arrangements adopted or changes, additions or modification to
any existing Casden Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to
materially increase the cost or liability under any Casden Benefit Plan.
Neither Casden nor any Casden Subsidiary nor any of their ERISA Affiliates
has any obligation to provide any former or present employee, director,
officer, partner, agent or consultant any profit sharing, springing or
existing equity or profit interest or participation, any paid sabbatical,
or the right to purchase any asset or property including, without
limitation, any apartment. With respect to the Casden Benefit Plans, a copy
of (i) the last two annual reports (IRS Form 5500 Series, together with all
required schedules and accountant's reports or opinions) prepared in
connection with any such Casden Benefit Plan, as applicable (ii) the latest
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") for any
Casden Benefit Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401 of
the Code, (iii) the most recent summary plan description, if any, and (iv)
a copy of the material documents and instruments establishing and governing
each Casden Benefit Plan (including all amendments thereto) previously have
been made available to AIMCO.

                  (b) CONTRIBUTIONS. All contributions and other
payments required to be made by Casden or any of the Casden Subsidiaries or
any of their ERISA Affiliates to any Casden Benefit Plan (or to any person
pursuant to the terms thereof) have been made or the amount of such payment
or contribution obligations has been reflected in the Casden Financial
Statements to the extent required by GAAP.

                  (c) QUALIFICATION; COMPLIANCE. Except where the
failure to so comply with each of the following representations would not
individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to result in a
Casden Material Adverse Effect, and with respect to any "multiemployer
plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) the representations in this
Section 4.8(c) are limited to the knowledge of Casden or any Casden
Subsidiary, (i) each of the Casden Benefit Plans intended to be "qualified"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by the
IRS to be so qualified, and, to the knowledge of Casden, the Casden
Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates, no circumstances exist that are
reasonably expected by Casden, any Casden Subsidiary or any of their ERISA
Affiliates to result in the revocation of any such determination; (ii)
Casden, the Casden Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates are in
compliance with, and each of the Casden Benefit Plans is and has been
operated in compliance with, all applicable laws, rules and regulations
governing such plan, including, ERISA and the Code; (iii) each Casden
Benefit Plan intended to provide for the deferral of income, the reduction
of salary or other compensation, or to afford other income tax benefits,
complies with the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Code or
other laws, rules and regulations required to provide such income tax
benefits; and (iv) no "prohibited transactions" (as defined in Section 406
or 407 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) have occurred for which a
statutory or administrative exemption is not available with respect to any
Casden Benefit Plan and which could give rise to liability on the part of
Casden, any Casden Subsidiary, any of their ERISA Affiliates, any Casden
Benefit Plan, or any fiduciary, party in interest or disqualified Person
with respect to any Casden Benefit Plan.

                  (d) LIABILITIES. With respect to the Casden Benefit
Plans, no event has occurred, and, to the knowledge of Casden, the Casden
Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates, there does not now exist any
condition or set of circumstances that could reasonably be expected to
subject Casden, any of the Casden Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA
Affiliates to any material liability arising under the Code, ERISA or any
other applicable law (including any liability to any such plan or the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC")), excluding liabilities
for benefit claims and funding obligations payable in the ordinary course.
No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by Casden, any of
the Casden Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates during the last
six (6) years that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists
that presents a risk to Casden, any of the Casden Subsidiaries or any of
their ERISA Affiliates of incurring any liability under such Title, other
than liability for premiums due the PBGC, which payments have been or will
be made when due except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Casden Material Adverse Effect.

                  (e) WELFARE PLANS. None of the Casden Benefit Plans
that are "welfare plans," within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA,
provide for any material benefits with respect to current or former
employees for periods extending beyond their retirement or other
termination of service, other than continuation coverage required to be
provided under Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA.

                  (f) PENALTIES. To Casden or any Casden Subsidiary's
knowledge, none of any Casden Benefit Plan, any trust created thereunder,
nor any trustee or administrator of any Casden Benefit Plan taken any
action or failed to take any action which could reasonably be expected to
subject Casden, any Casden Subsidiary or any of their ERISA Affiliates to
any material liability for either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to
Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975(a)
or (b) or 4976 or 4980B of the Code.

                  (g) PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM THE TRANSACTIONS. Other
than with respect to the option awards referred to in Section 7.11(a), or
with respect to the employment agreements or arrangements set forth in
Section 4.8(a) of the Casden Disclosure Letter, the consummation or
announcement of any of the Transactions will not (either alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional or further acts or events, including the
termination of employment of any officers, directors, employees, agents or
directors of Casden or any Casden Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing),
result in any (i) payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming
due from Casden or any of the Casden Subsidiaries to any Affected Employee
(as defined in Section 7.11(a)) or to the trustee under any "rabbi trust"
or similar arrangement, (ii) benefit of any Affected Employee under any
Casden Benefit Plan becoming accelerated, vested or payable or (iii) "mass
layoff" or "plant closing" as defined in the WARN Act requiring notice or
pay in lieu of notice.

                  (h) MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN. With respect to any Casden
Benefit Plan that is a "multiemployer plan," as such term is defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA, (i) neither Casden, any Casden Subsidiary nor any
ERISA Affiliate has, since September 26, 1980, made or suffered a "complete
withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal," as such terms are respectively
defined in Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA, (ii) no event has occurred that
presents a material risk of a complete or partial withdrawal, (iii) neither
Casden, any Casden Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate has any contingent
liability under Section 4204 of ERISA, (iv) to the knowledge of Casden or
any Casden Subsidiary, no circumstances exist that present a material risk
that any such multi-employer plan will go into reorganization, and (v) to
the knowledge of Casden or any Casden Subsidiary, the aggregate withdrawal
liability of Casden, each Casden Subsidiary and the ERISA Affiliates,
computed as if a complete withdrawal by Casden, each Casden Subsidiary and
all of its ERISA Affiliates had occurred under each such multiemployer plan
on the date hereof, would be zero.

                  (i) TITLE IV PLANS. Except with respect to any
multiemployer plans, no Casden Employee Plan is subject to Title IV of
ERISA and neither Casden, any ERISA Affiliate, nor any Casden Subsidiary
has ever sponsored, maintained, contributed to, or incurred an obligation
to contribute to, any plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA.

                  (j) DEDUCTIBILITY OF PAYMENTS. Except as disclosed
in Section 4.8(j) of the Casden Disclosure Letter, there is no Casden
Benefit Plan or any other contract, agreement or arrangement with respect
to any "disqualified individual" within the meaning of Section 1.280G-1 of
the Proposed Regulations of Casden that could, individually or
collectively, give rise to the payment of any amount by Casden or any
Casden Subsidiary as a result of the consummation of the Transactions that
would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G of the Code.

                  (k) LABOR MATTERS. Except as set forth in Section
4.8(k) of the Casden Disclosure Letter:

                           (i) there is no labor strike, slowdown, work
stoppage or lockout in effect, or, to the knowledge of Casden, threatened
against or otherwise affecting Casden or any Casden Subsidiary, nor has
Casden or any Casden Subsidiary experienced any such labor controversy
since December 31, 1996;

                           (ii) there is no unfair labor practice charge or
complaint pending or, to the knowledge of Casden, threatened against or
otherwise affecting Casden or any Casden Subsidiary before the National
Labor Relations Board or any similar state or foreign agency;

                           (iii) no grievance or arbitration proceeding
before any Governmental Authority relating to any of the employees or
former employees of Casden or any Casden Subsidiary, any labor organization
or other representative of the employees or arising out of any collective
bargaining agreement is pending or, to the knowledge of Casden, threatened
against or otherwise affecting Casden or any Casden Subsidiary, which, if
adversely decided, would reasonably be expected to have a Casden Material
Adverse Effect; and

                           (iv) no collective bargaining agreement exists
that is binding on Casden or any Casden Subsidiary, and no petition has
been filed or proceedings instituted by an employee or group of employees
of Casden or any Casden Subsidiary with any labor relations board seeking
recognition of a bargaining representative, and, to the knowledge of
Casden, no organizational effort is currently being made or has been made
since December 31, 1996, on behalf of any labor union to organize any
employees of Casden or any Casden Subsidiary.

                  (l) CONSENT DECREES OR SETTLEMENTS. Except as set
forth on Section 4.8(l) of the Casden Disclosure Letter, Casden is not a
party to, or otherwise bound by, any consent decree or settlement agreement
with, or citation by, any Government Authority relating to employees or the
employment practices of Casden.

                  (m) COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. To the knowledge of Casden,
Casden is in material compliance with all applicable laws respecting
employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment,
immigration, wages, hours of work, independent contractor classification,
income tax withholding and occupational safety and health.

                  (n) PENDING OR THREATENED PROCEEDINGS. There are no
proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Casden, threatened in writing
against or otherwise affecting Casden before any Governmental Authority
brought by or on behalf of any of Casden's employees, prospective employees
or former employees alleging breach of any express or implied contract of
employment or any law or regulation governing employment or the termination
thereof or other discriminatory, wrongful or tortious conduct in connection
with the employment relationship, which, if adversely decided, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Casden.

                  (o) EMPLOYMENT TERMINATIONS. To the knowledge of
Casden, and other than the Transferred Employees, no officer or other key

Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws,

written communication from any Governmental Authority that alleges that
Casden or any of the Casden Subsidiaries is not in compliance with
applicable Environmental Laws, except as in the aggregate would not result
in a Casden Material Adverse Effect. Compliance with all applicable
Environmental Laws will not require Casden or any Casden Subsidiary to
incur costs that would be reasonably likely to result in a Casden Material
Adverse Effect.

                  (b) ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS. Casden and each of the
Casden Subsidiaries has obtained or has applied for all environmental,

Claim pending or, to the knowledge of Casden, threatened in writing (i)
against Casden or any of the Casden Subsidiaries, (ii) against any Person
whose liability for any Environmental Claim Casden or any of the Casden
Subsidiaries has or may have retained or assumed either contractually or by
operation of law, or (iii) against any real or personal property or
operations which Casden or any of the Casden Subsidiaries owns, leases or
manages, in whole or in part, except, in each case, for Environmental
Claims which in the aggregate would not result in a Casden Material Adverse
Effect. To the knowledge of Casden, no circumstances, events or conditions
exist that would reasonably be expected to form the basis of any
Environmental Claim against Casden or the Casden Subsidiaries, except as in
the aggregate would not result in a Casden Material Adverse Effect.

                  (d) HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. To the knowledge of Casden,
no Hazardous Materials are located on any Casden Property, except in
compliance with all Environmental Laws or except as in the aggregate would

storage tank is located on any Casden Property, except in compliance with
all Environmental Laws or except as in the aggregate would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Casden Material Adverse Effect.

                  (f) PREDECESSORS. To the knowledge of Casden, there
is no pending or threatened Environmental Claim with respect to any
predecessor of Casden or any of the Casden Subsidiaries which would have a
Casden Material Adverse Effect, or any Environmental Release of Hazardous
Materials that would be reasonably likely to form the basis of any
Environmental Claim, except for Environmental Claims which in the aggregate
would not result in a Casden Material Adverse Effect.

                  (g) REPORTS. Casden has delivered to AIMCO copies of
all environmental assessments, audits and reports in its possession
relating to the Casden Properties.

                  (h) GOVERNMENTAL APPROVAL. The Transactions do not
require governmental approval under Environmental Laws.

                  (i) MOLD. To the knowledge of Casden, no colonies or
growths of toxin-producing molds or fungi are located in any habitable
structures on any Casden Property, except as in the aggregate would not
result in a Casden Material Adverse Effect. There are no claims pending or,
to the knowledge of Casden, threatened, against Casden or any of the Casden
Subsidiaries or with respect to any real or personal property or operations
which Casden or any of the Casden Subsidiaries owns, leases or manages, in
whole or in part, alleging the presence of any such molds or fungi, except
as in the aggregate would not result in a Casden Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.12       ABSENCE OF INDUCEMENT. In entering into the
Transaction Documents, Casden has not been induced by, or relied upon, any
representations, warranties or statements by AIMCO not set forth or
referred to in the Transaction Documents, the Schedules thereto or the
other documents required to be delivered thereby, whether or not such
representations, warranties or statements have actually been made, and
Casden acknowledges that, in entering into the Transaction Documents, AIMCO
has been induced by and relied upon the representations and warranties of
Casden herein set forth, the information set forth in the Casden Financial

         Section 4.13       REAL PROPERTIES.

                  (a) OWNERSHIP. Section 4.13(a) of the Casden

                           (i) each real property owned in whole or in part
         by Casden or a Casden Subsidiary other than the NAPICO Properties
         (collectively, the "Owned Properties"), together with the name of
         the entity or entities which own each such Owned Property (the
         "Owned Property Owners") and the percentage interests and
         organizational structure pursuant to which each such Owned
         Property is owned;

                           (ii) each real property leased in whole or in
         part by Casden or a Casden Subsidiary as a tenant (collectively,
         the "Leased Properties"), together with the name of the entity or
         entities which lease each such Leased Property (the "Leased
         Property Lessees") and the percentage interests and organizational
         structure pursuant to which each such Leased Property is leased;
         and

                           (iii) each real property owned by a NAPICO
         Entity as of November 1, 2001 (collectively, the "NAPICO
         Properties"), together with the name of the entity or entities
         which own each such NAPICO Property (the "NAPICO Property
         Owners"), the name of the NAPICO Entity that controls such owner
         and the percentage interest and organizational structure pursuant
         to which such NAPICO Entity controls such owner.

Each Owned Property Owner holds good, valid, marketable and indefeasible
fee simple title to the Owned Property, or the applicable portion thereof,
that Section 4.13(a) of the Casden Disclosure Letter indicates as being
owned by such Owned Property Owner, free and clear of all Liens, rights of
way, easements and any other matters affecting title, other than
encumbrances which do not materially adversely affect the value of such
property or the use thereof, which are described in Section 4.13(a) of the
Casden Disclosure Letter or which are shown on the title insurance policy
or title report with respect thereto ("Permitted Encumbrances"), with full
right to convey the same. To Casden's knowledge, each Leased Property
Lessee holds a good, valid, marketable and indefeasible leasehold interest
in and to the Leased Property that Section 4.13(a) of the Casden Disclosure
Letter indicates as being leased by such Leased Property Lessee, free and
clear of all Liens, rights of way, easements and any other matters
affecting title, other than Permitted Encumbrances, with full right to
convey the same, subject to obtaining the consents specified on Section
4.13(a) of the Casden Disclosure Letter. Each NAPICO Property Owner holds
good, valid, marketable and indefeasible fee simple title to the NAPICO
Property, or the applicable portion thereof, that Section 4.13(a) of the
Casden Disclosure Letter indicates as being owned by such NAPICO Property
Owner, free and clear of all Liens, rights of way, easements and any other
matters affecting title, other than Permitted Encumbrances, with full right
to convey the same. Except as may be set forth in Section 4.13(a) of the
Casden Disclosure Letter, neither Casden nor any Casden Subsidiary nor, to
Casden's knowledge, any owner or lessee of any Casden Property has granted
any option, right of first refusal, rights of first offer or comparable
right to any third party to purchase or otherwise acquire a direct or
indirect interest in any of the Casden Properties; provided, however, that
in certain jurisdictions, tenants may have rights of first refusal or
rights of first offer pursuant to applicable laws, ordinances, statutes,
rules and regulations governing the transfer, ownership, use, operation,
management and occupation of residential real estate and rental properties
(collectively, "Laws"). The Casden Properties include all real properties
used by Casden and the Casden Subsidiaries in the conduct of their
respective businesses. The NAPICO Properties include all real properties
used by the NAPICO Entities in the conduct of their respective businesses.

                  (b) GROUND LEASES. A true, accurate and complete
copy of each lease pursuant to which each Leased Property Lessee leases a
Leased Property (each, a "Ground Lease") has heretofore been delivered to
AIMCO. To Casden's knowledge, each Ground Lease is valid, binding and
enforceable in accordance with its terms and is in full force and effect.
There are no existing material defaults by any Leased Property Lessee under
any of the Ground Leases.

                  (c) NOTICES TO REPAIR. Except as set forth in
Section 4.13(c) of the Casden Disclosure Letter, neither Casden nor any
owner or lessee of any of the Casden Properties has received any written
notice of any requirements by any insurance company that has issued a
policy covering any Casden Property or by any board of fire underwriters or
other body of competent jurisdiction of any repairs or work to be done on
any part of any Casden Property, which repair or work has not been
completed.

                  (d) APPROVALS. Except as set forth in Section
4.13(d) of the Casden Disclosure Letter, to Casden's knowledge, Casden (or
the applicable owner or lessee of the Casden Properties) has obtained all
appropriate material certificates of occupancy, licenses, easements and
rights of way, including proofs of dedication, required to use and operate
the Casden Properties in the manner in which the Casden Properties are
currently being used and operated. True, accurate and complete copies of
all such certificates, permits and licenses have heretofore been furnished
to AIMCO. Except as set forth in Section 4.13(d) of the Casden Disclosure
Letter, to Casden's knowledge, Casden and each owner (or lessee in the case
of Leased Properties) of each Casden Property has all material approvals,
permits and licenses necessary to own or operate the Casden Properties as
currently owned and operated, and no such material approvals, permits or
licenses will be required to be issued after the date hereof as a result of
the Transactions in order to permit AIMCO and its Subsidiaries to continue
to own or operate the Casden Properties following the Closing in the same
manner as heretofore owned or operated, other than any such approvals,
permits and licenses that are ministerial in nature and are normally issued
in due course upon application therefor without further action by the
applicant or the failure of which to obtain would not, in the aggregate,
result in a Casden Material Adverse Effect.

                  (e) COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Except as set forth in
Section 4.13(e) of the Casden Disclosure Letter, to Casden's knowledge,
each Casden Property is in material compliance with all material Laws,
including, all material Laws with respect to zoning, building, fire and
health codes, and sanitation and pollution control.

                  (f) CONDEMNATION; SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS. Except as set
forth in Section 4.13(f) of the Casden Disclosure Letter, Casden has no
knowledge of any pending or threatened condemnation, eminent domain or
similar proceeding or special assessment which would materially and
adversely affect any of the Casden Properties.

                  (g) PERSONAL PROPERTY. Except as set forth in
Section 4.13(g) of the Casden Disclosure Letter and except for personal
property of which any owner or lessee of any Casden Property is a lessee,
all of the personal property owned by Casden and the Casden Subsidiaries is
owned by each such entity free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted
Encumbrances and, in the case of personal property located on a Leased
Property, other than any applicable landlord's Lien, and each such entity
has good and marketable title to its respective personal property.

                  (h) MORTGAGES; ENCUMBRANCES. Section 4.13(h) of the
Casden Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of each and every outstanding
mortgage or deed of trust encumbering any Owned Property or interest in
Casden Property, or Casden's interest in any other Casden Property
(together with the name of the Owned Property encumbered thereby), and
there are no other mortgages or deeds of trust (other than Permitted
Encumbrances) encumbering the Owned Properties, or Casden's interest in any
other Casden Property. Except as set forth in Section 4.13(h) of the Casden
Disclosure Letter, Casden has not received any written notice of any
proceedings, claims, disputes or conditions affecting any Casden Property
that might materially curtail or interfere with the use of the Casden
Properties. Except as set forth in Section 4.13(h) of the Casden Disclosure
Letter, neither Casden nor any owner (or lessee in the case of Leased
Property) of any of the Casden Properties is a party to any commercial
lease or similar arrangement under which Casden or such owner (or lessee in
the case of Leased Property) is a lessor or otherwise makes available for
use by any third party for any commercial purpose any portion of any Casden
Property, in each case where such commercial lease or similar arrangement
or permitted use is material to the income derived from, or the value of,
such Casden Property.

                  (i) PROPERTY LEVEL RESERVES. Except as set forth in
Section 4.13(i) of the Casden Disclosure Letter, to the knowledge of
Casden, all Owned Properties (other than the "conventional" and the "80-20"
properties) have property level reserves, and such property level reserves
are sufficient for the reasonably anticipated immediate capital
requirements of the respective Owned Properties for the 12-month period
following the Effective Time, provided, however, that no representation or
warranty is herein made as to (i) the needs or available funds related to
such conventional and 80-20 properties or (ii) any future exercise by HUD
or any state affordable housing agency of its discretion to (A) allow or
disallow use of such reserves or (B) require additional reserves or
additional repairs or capital improvements.

         Section 4.14      BOOKS AND RECORDS. The books of account, minute
books, stock record books and other records of Casden and the Casden
Subsidiaries, all of which have been made available to AIMCO, are complete
and correct in all material respects and have been maintained in accordance
with sound business practices, including an adequate system of internal
controls. The minute books of Casden contain accurate and complete records
of all meetings held of, and corporate action taken by, the Casden
stockholders, the Casden Board of Directors and committees of the Casden
Board of Directors, and no meeting of any of such Casden stockholders, the
Casden Board of Directors or such committees has been held for which
minutes have not been prepared and are not contained in such minute books.
All of such books and records are in the possession of Casden or the Casden
Subsidiary to which they relate.

         Section 4.15      NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except (a) as
disclosed in the Casden Financial Statements, (b) pursuant to the terms and
conditions of any Contracts listed in Section 4.17 of the Casden Disclosure
Letter and (c) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with past practice since December 31,
2000, neither Casden nor any Casden Subsidiary has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise,
material to Casden and the Casden Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The
reserves reflected in the Casden Financial Statements are adequate,
appropriate and reasonable and have been calculated in a consistent manner.

         Section 4.16      INSURANCE. Section 4.16 of the Casden Disclosure
Letter contains a complete and accurate description of all fire, liability,
workmen's compensation and other insurance policies owned or held by Casden
and each Casden Subsidiary, including insurance policies covering material
litigation against Casden or any Casden Subsidiary. Copies of all such
insurance policies have been made available to AIMCO. All such policies are
in full force and effect, all premiums with respect thereto covering all
periods up to and including the Closing Date have been, or will be, paid
within the time specified in such policies, and no notice of cancellation
or termination has been received with respect to any such policy. Such
policies are sufficient for compliance with all requirements of law and all
Contracts to which Casden or any Casden Subsidiary is a party; are valid,
outstanding and enforceable policies; provide adequate insurance coverage
for the assets and operations of Casden and each Casden Subsidiary; will
remain in full force and effect through the respective dates set forth in
the Casden Disclosure Letter without the payment of additional premiums;
and will not in any way be affected by, or terminate or lapse by reason of,
the Transactions. The Casden Disclosure Letter identifies all risks which
Casden, its Board of Directors or officers have designated as being self
insured. Neither Casden nor any Casden Subsidiary has been refused any
insurance with respect to its assets or operations, nor has its coverage
been limited, by any insurance carrier to which it has applied for any such
insurance or with which it has carried insurance since December 31, 1998.

         Section 4.17       CONTRACTS. Section 4.17 of the Casden Disclosure
Letter contains a complete and accurate list, and each of Casden and the
Casden Subsidiaries has delivered to AIMCO, true and complete copies,

any Holder, Casden, any Casden Subsidiary or any Affiliate of Casden in
violation of any federal, state, local, municipal, foreign, international,
multinational or other administrative order, constitution, law, ordinance,
principle of common law, regulation, statute, or treaty (including existing
site plan approvals, zoning or subdivision regulations or urban
redevelopment plans relating to real property) known to Casden. Neither
Casden nor any Casden Subsidiary, nor, to Casden's knowledge, any current

and XYZ. Except as set forth in the AIMCO SEC Reports or the disclosure
letter from AIMCO to Casden dated the date hereof (the "AIMCO Disclosure
Letter"):

         Section 5.1       ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION. AIMCO and each
AIMCO Subsidiary is a corporation or other entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization, has all requisite power and authority, and
has been duly authorized by all necessary approvals and orders to own,
lease and operate its assets and properties to the extent owned, leased and
operated and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is
duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its assets
and properties makes such qualification necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure so to qualify would not reasonably be
expected to have an AIMCO Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.2       AIMCO SUBSIDIARIES. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock and all other equity interests owned in
each AIMCO Subsidiary are, in the case of capital stock, validly issued,
fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive rights, and, in the case
of capital stock and all other equity interests in any entity, are owned,
directly or indirectly, by AIMCO free and clear of any Liens and there are
no outstanding subscriptions, options, calls, contracts, voting trusts,
proxies or other commitments, understandings, restrictions, arrangements,
rights or warrants, including any right of conversion or exchange under any
outstanding security, instrument or agreement, obligating by AIMCO or any
AIMCO Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,
delivered or sold, additional shares of its capital stock or other equity
interests or obligating it to grant, extend or enter into any such
agreement or commitment.

         Section 5.3       CAPITALIZATION. As of the date hereof, the
authorized capital stock of AIMCO consists of (i) 510,587,500 shares of
capital stock, of which 456,962,738 shares are classified as Class A Common
Stock and the remainder are classified as Preferred Stock and (ii) no
Voting Debt was issued or outstanding. All outstanding shares of AIMCO
Common Stock and AIMCO Preferred Stock have been validly issued free of
preemptive rights, and are fully paid and non-assessable. Upon consummation
of the Merger and the concurrent automatic conversion of the Casden Capital
Stock into AIMCO Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.2(a), all such
shares will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and will not
be subject to preemptive rights. As of the date hereof, except as set forth
in Section 5.3 of the AIMCO Disclosure Letter or pursuant to this Agreement
and the AIMCO Benefit Plans, there are no securities, outstanding
subscriptions, calls, options, contracts, voting trusts, proxies or other
commitments, understandings, restrictions, arrangements, rights or
warrants, including any right of conversion or exchange under any
outstanding security, instrument or other agreement to which AIMCO or any
AIMCO Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them are bound obligating
AIMCO or any AIMCO Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be
issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock or any Voting
Debt of AIMCO or any AIMCO Subsidiary or obligating AIMCO or any AIMCO
Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call,
right, commitment or agreement.

         Section 5.4       AUTHORITY; NON-CONTRAVENTION; STATUTORY APPROVALS;
                           COMPLIANCE.

                  (a) AUTHORITY. AIMCO has all requisite power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject to the receipt
of the applicable AIMCO Required Statutory Approvals (as defined in Section
5.4(c)), to consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation by AIMCO of the Transactions have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of AIMCO. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by AIMCO and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Casden,
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of AIMCO enforceable against
AIMCO in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors' rights
and general principles of equity. No approval of AIMCO's stockholders is
required to execute and deliver this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions, including the issuance and listing on the NYSE of the AIMCO
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and the assumption of all
obligations of Casden and the performance of all actions required by the
documents governing such obligations.

                  (b) NON-CONTRAVENTION. Except as set forth in
Section 5.4(b) of the AIMCO Disclosure Letter, the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by AIMCO does not, and the consummation of the
Transactions will not, result in a Violation with respect to AIMCO or any
of the AIMCO Subsidiaries pursuant to any provisions of (i) the AIMCO
Charter, bylaws or similar organizational or governing documents of AIMCO
or any of the AIMCO Subsidiaries, (ii) subject to obtaining the AIMCO
Required Statutory Approvals, any statute, law, ordinance, rule,
regulation, judgment, decree, order, injunction, writ, permit or license of
any Governmental Authority applicable to AIMCO or any of the AIMCO
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets or (iii)
subject to obtaining the third-party consents set forth in Section 5.4(b)
of the AIMCO Disclosure Letter, any Contract to which AIMCO or any of the
AIMCO Subsidiaries is a party or to which such Persons or any of their
respective properties or assets are subject, except in the case of the
foregoing clause (ii) or (iii) for any such Violation which would not
reasonably be expected to have an AIMCO Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c) STATUTORY APPROVALS. No declaration, filing or
registration with, or notice to or authorization, consent or approval of,
any Governmental Authority is necessary for the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by AIMCO or the consummation by AIMCO of the Transactions,
except (i) acceptance of the Articles of Merger by the MSDAT, (ii) as
described in Section 5.4(c) of the AIMCO Disclosure Letter or (iii)
declarations, filings, registrations, notices, authorizations, consents or
approvals, the failure of which to make, give or obtain would not result in
an AIMCO Material Adverse Effect (the "AIMCO Required Statutory Approvals,"
it being understood that references in this Agreement to "obtaining" such
AIMCO Required Statutory Approvals shall mean making such declarations,
filings or registrations; giving such notices; obtaining such
authorizations, consents or approvals; and observing such waiting periods
as are necessary to avoid a violation of law). For purposes of determining
compliance with the HSR Act, AIMCO confirms that the conduct of its
business consists primarily of investing in, owning, developing and
operating real estate for the benefit of its stockholders.

                  (d) COMPLIANCE. Except as set forth in Section
5.4(d) of the AIMCO Disclosure Letter, neither AIMCO nor any of the AIMCO
Subsidiaries (i) is in violation of or has been given notice or been
charged with any violation of or (ii) to the knowledge of AIMCO, is under
investigation with respect to any violation of, any law, statute, order,
rule, regulation, ordinance or judgment (including any applicable
Environmental Laws) of any Governmental Authority. AIMCO and the AIMCO
Subsidiaries have all permits, licenses (including licenses to operate as a
property manager), franchises and other governmental authorizations,
consents and approvals necessary to conduct their businesses as presently
conducted, except where the failure to obtain such permits, licenses
(including licenses required as a property manager), franchises and other
authorizations, consents and approvals would not reasonably be expected to
have an AIMCO Material Adverse Effect. Neither AIMCO nor any AIMCO
Subsidiary is in breach or violation of, or in default in the performance
or observance of, any term or provision of, and no event has occurred
which, with lapse of time or action by a third party, could result in a
default by AIMCO or any AIMCO Subsidiary under (i) AIMCO's or AIMCO OP's
organizational or governing documents or (ii) any Contract to which AIMCO
or any AIMCO Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound or to which its
property is subject, except for possible Violations which individually or
in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have an AIMCO Material
Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.5       REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The AIMCO SEC
Reports have been filed with the SEC, including all forms, statements,
reports, agreements (oral or written) and all documents, exhibits,
amendments and supplements appertaining thereto, and such items complied,
as of their respective dates, in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of the appropriate statutes and the rules and regulations
thereunder, except for such filings the failure of which to have been made
or to so comply would not result in an AIMCO Material Adverse Effect. As of
their respective dates, the AIMCO SEC Reports did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The audited
consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim financial
statements of AIMCO included in the AIMCO SEC Reports (collectively, the
"AIMCO Financial Statements") have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis (except as may be indicated therein or in the
notes thereto and except with respect to unaudited statements as permitted
by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly present in all material respects the
financial position of AIMCO as of the dates thereof and the results of
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended, subject, in the case
of the unaudited interim financial statements, to normal, recurring and
year-end audit adjustments. True, accurate and complete copies of the AIMCO
Charter and the AIMCO bylaws, each as amended to date and in effect on the
date hereof, have been provided to Casden.

         Section 5.6       ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Except as
otherwise expressly permitted in Section 6.2 of this Agreement or required
by Article VII of this Agreement, since December 31, 2000, AIMCO and each
of the AIMCO Subsidiaries have conducted their business only in the
ordinary course of business (except for acquisitions and dispositions)
consistent with past practice and there has not been any event or condition
which would reasonably be expected to result in an AIMCO Material Adverse
Effect.

         Section 5.7       LITIGATION. Except as disclosed in Section 5.7
of the AIMCO Disclosure Letter, (a) there are no claims, suits, actions or
proceedings against AIMCO or any AIMCO Subsidiary or any of their
respective properties which would reasonably be expected to have an AIMCO
Material Adverse Effect, (b) there are no claims, suits, actions or
proceedings by any Governmental Authority or third party, pending or, to
the knowledge of AIMCO, threatened, nor are there, any investigations or
reviews by any Governmental Authority pending or threatened against,
relating to or affecting AIMCO or any of the AIMCO Subsidiaries which would
reasonably be expected to have an AIMCO Material Adverse Effect, (c) there
have not been any significant adverse developments since December 31, 2000
with respect to such disclosed claims, suits, actions, proceedings,
investigations or reviews and (d) there are no judgments, decrees,
injunctions or orders of any Governmental Authority specifically applicable
to AIMCO or any AIMCO Subsidiary which would reasonably be expected to have
an AIMCO Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.8       REGISTRATION STATEMENT. None of the information
supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of AIMCO for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in any Registration Statement will, at the time
such Registration Statement is filed by AIMCO with the SEC and at the time
it becomes effective under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the
case may be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading. Each Registration Statement will
comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable.

         Section 5.9       TAX MATTERS. Except as set forth in Section 5.9
of the AIMCO Disclosure Letter:

                  (a) FILING OF TIMELY TAX RETURNS. AIMCO and each of
the AIMCO Subsidiaries have filed (or there have been filed on such
Persons' behalf) all Tax Returns required to be filed by each of them under
applicable law. All such Tax Returns were and are in all material respects
true, complete and correct and filed on a timely basis.

                  (b) PAYMENT OF TAXES. AIMCO and each of the AIMCO
Subsidiaries have paid all Taxes that are currently due and payable for all
periods through and including the Closing Date within the time and in the
manner prescribed by law, except for those Taxes contested in good faith
and for which adequate reserves have been provided on their books and
records.

                  (c) TAX RESERVES. AIMCO and each of the AIMCO
Subsidiaries have established on their books and records reserves adequate

material assets of AIMCO or any of the AIMCO Subsidiaries except liens for
Taxes not yet delinquent.

                  (e) WITHHOLDING TAXES. AIMCO and each of the AIMCO

the Code relating to the withholding of Taxes, as well as similar
provisions under any other laws, and have, within the time and in the
manner prescribed by law, withheld and paid over to the proper governmental
authorities all amounts required.

                  (f) REIT CLASSIFICATION. At all times since the
initial public offering of AIMCO, AIMCO has been organized and operated in
conformity with the Status Requirements, and its proposed method of
operation after the Merger will enable it to continue to meet the Status
Requirements and otherwise qualify as a REIT.

                  (g) CONTINUATION AS REIT. The execution or delivery
by AIMCO of this Agreement and the consummation by AIMCO of the
Transactions or compliance with or fulfillment of the terms and provisions
hereof by AIMCO, will not adversely affect the qualification of AIMCO as a
REIT for each taxable year ending on or after the Closing Date.

                  (h) AUDIT, ADMINISTRATIVE AND COURT PROCEEDINGS. No
audits or other administrative proceedings or court proceedings are
presently pending with regard to any material Taxes or Tax Returns of AIMCO
or any of the AIMCO Subsidiaries.

                  (i) TAX RULINGS. Neither AIMCO nor any of the AIMCO
Subsidiaries has received or has pending a Tax Ruling or entered into a
Closing Agreement with any taxing authority.

                  (j) TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS. Except as between
affiliates of AIMCO as set forth in Section 5.9 of the AIMCO Disclosure
Letter, neither AIMCO nor any AIMCO Subsidiary is a party to any agreement
relating to allocating or sharing Taxes.

                  (k) LIABILITY FOR OTHERS. Neither AIMCO nor any of
the Subsidiaries of AIMCO has any liability for material Taxes of any
person other than AIMCO and the AIMCO Subsidiaries (i) under Treasury Reg.

(ii) by Contract, or (iii) otherwise.

                  (l) SECTION 341(f). Neither AIMCO nor any of the
AIMCO Subsidiaries has, with regard to any assets or property held or
acquired by any of them, filed a consent to the application of Section
341(f)(2) of the Code, or agreed to have Section 341(f)(2) of the Code
apply to any disposition of a subsection (f) asset (as such term is defined
in Section 341(f)(4) of the Code) owned by AIMCO or any of the AIMCO
Subsidiaries.

                  (m) DEFICIENCIES. No deficiencies for any Taxes have
been proposed, asserted or assessed against AIMCO and there is no
outstanding waiver of the statute of limitations with respect to any Taxes
or Tax Returns of AIMCO.

                  (n) DOMESTIC CONTROL. AIMCO believes that it is a
"domestically controlled" REIT within the meaning of Section 897(h)(4)(B)
of the Code.

         Section 5.10      EMPLOYEE MATTERS; ERISA.  Except as set forth in
Section 5.10 of the AIMCO Disclosure Letter:

                  (a) BENEFIT PLANS. As of the date hereof, AIMCO has
made available to Casden a copy of each written or oral material employment
agreement, arrangement, commitment, severance or retention agreement or
policy, employee benefit plan, policy or agreement covering employees,
former employees or directors of AIMCO and each of the AIMCO Subsidiaries
or their beneficiaries, or providing benefits to such Persons in respect of
services provided to any such entity, including any material employee
benefit plans within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA and any material
severance or change in control agreement (collectively, the "AIMCO Benefit
Plans"). Since December 31, 1996, there have been no new plans adopted nor
changes, additions or modification to any existing AIMCO Benefit Plans that
could reasonably be expected to materially increase the cost of such AIMCO
Benefit Plan.

                  (b) CONTRIBUTIONS. All material contributions and
other material payments required to be made by AIMCO or any of the AIMCO
Subsidiaries to any AIMCO Benefit Plan (or to any Person pursuant to the
terms thereof) have been made or the amount of such payment or contribution
obligations has been reflected in the AIMCO Financial Statements to the
extent required by GAAP.

                  (c) QUALIFICATION; COMPLIANCE. Except where the
failure to so comply with each of the following representations would not
individually or in the aggregate be expected to result in an AIMCO Material
Adverse Effect: (i) each of the AIMCO Benefit Plans intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has been
determined by the IRS to be so qualified, and, to the knowledge of AIMCO,
no circumstances exist that are reasonably expected by AIMCO to result in
the revocation of any such determination; (ii) AIMCO is in compliance with,
and each of the AIMCO Benefit Plans is and has been operated in compliance
with, all applicable laws, rules and regulations governing such plan,
including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code; (iii) each AIMCO Benefit
Plan intended to provide for the deferral of income, the reduction of
salary or other compensation, or to afford other income tax benefits,
complies with the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Code or
other laws, rules and regulations required to provide such income tax
benefits; and (iv) no "prohibited transactions" (as defined in Section 406
or 407 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) have occurred for which a
statutory or administrative exemption is not available with respect to any
AIMCO Benefit Plan, and which could give rise to liability on the part of
AIMCO, any AIMCO Benefit Plan, or any fiduciary, party in interest or
disqualified Person.

                  (d) LIABILITIES. With respect to the AIMCO Benefit
Plans and except for liabilities that individually or in the aggregate
would not reasonably be expected to result in an AIMCO Material Adverse
Effect, no event has occurred, and, to the knowledge of AIMCO, there does
not now exist any condition or set of circumstances that could reasonably
be expected to subject AIMCO or any of the AIMCO Subsidiaries to any
material liability arising under the Code, ERISA or any other applicable
law (including any liability to any such plan or the PBGC), excluding
liabilities for benefit claims and funding obligations payable in the
ordinary course.

                  (e) WELFARE PLANS. None of the AIMCO Benefit Plans
that are "welfare plans," within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA,
provide for any material benefits with respect to current or former
employees for periods extending beyond their retirement or other
termination of service, other than continuation coverage required to be
provided under Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA.

                  (f) PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM THE MERGER. The
consummation or announcement of any of the Transactions will not (either
alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or further acts or events
relating solely to the Transactions, including the termination of
employment of any officers, directors, employees or agents of AIMCO or any
of the AIMCO Subsidiaries) result in any (i) payment (whether of severance
pay or otherwise) becoming due from AIMCO or any of the AIMCO Subsidiaries
to any officer, employee, former employee or director thereof or to the
trustee under any "rabbi trust" or similar arrangement, or (ii) benefit
under any AIMCO Benefit Plan becoming accelerated, vested or payable.

         Section 5.11      ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.

                  (a) Except as set forth in Section 5.11 of the AIMCO
Disclosure Letter, to the knowledge of AIMCO:

                           (i) COMPLIANCE. AIMCO and each of the AIMCO
Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws
except, in either case, in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected
to result in an AIMCO Material Adverse Effect and neither AIMCO nor any of
the AIMCO Subsidiaries has received any written communication from any
Governmental Authority that alleges that AIMCO or any of the AIMCO
Subsidiaries is not in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws,
except, in either case, in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected
to result in an AIMCO Material Adverse Effect. Compliance with all
applicable Environmental Laws will not require AIMCO or any AIMCO
Subsidiary to incur costs that would be reasonably likely to result in an
AIMCO Material Adverse Effect.

                           (ii) ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS. AIMCO and each of
the AIMCO Subsidiaries have obtained or have applied for all Environmental
Permits necessary for the construction of their facilities or the conduct
of their operations, and all such Environmental Permits are in good
standing or, where applicable, a renewal application has been timely filed
and is pending agency approval, and AIMCO and the AIMCO Subsidiaries are in
compliance with all terms and conditions of the Environmental Permits,
except for Environmental Permits which in the aggregate would not
reasonably be expected to result in an AIMCO Material Adverse Effect.

                           (iii) ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS. There is no
Environmental Claim pending (A) against AIMCO or any of the AIMCO
Subsidiaries, (B) against any Person whose liability for any Environmental
Claim AIMCO or any of the AIMCO Subsidiaries has or may have retained or
assumed either contractually or by operation of law, or (C) against any
real or personal property or operations which AIMCO or any of the AIMCO
Subsidiaries owns, leases or manages, in whole or in part, except, in each
case, for Environmental Claims which in the aggregate would not reasonably
be expected to result in an AIMCO Material Adverse Effect.

                           (iv) ENVIRONMENTAL RELEASES. There has been no
Environmental Release of any Hazardous Material that would be reasonably
likely to form the basis of any Environmental Claim against AIMCO or any of
the AIMCO Subsidiaries or against any Person whose liability for any
Environmental Claim AIMCO or any of the AIMCO Subsidiaries has or may have
retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of law, except for
Environmental Releases which in the aggregate would not reasonably be
expected to result in an AIMCO Material Adverse Effect.

                           (v) PREDECESSORS. There is no pending or
threatened Environmental Claim with respect to any predecessor of AIMCO or
any of the AIMCO Subsidiaries which would have a AIMCO Material Adverse
Effect, or any Environmental Release of Hazardous Materials that would be
reasonably likely to form the basis of any Environmental Claim, except for
Environmental Claims which in the aggregate would not reasonably be
expected to result in an AIMCO Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.12      HUD. Other than as set forth on Section 5.12 of
the AIMCO Disclosure Letter and except where the failure to obtain, or the
presence of which, would not reasonably be expected to result in an AIMCO
Material Adverse Effect, each of AIMCO and the AIMCO Subsidiaries as of the
date hereof: (a) has all necessary consents and approvals of HUD to act as
a general partner of and/or management agent for, as the case may be, each
partnership which is an owner of a HUD-insured or HUD-assisted property for
which AIMCO or any AIMCO Subsidiary acts as a general partner and/or
management agent; (b) with respect to each HUD-insured or HUD-assisted
property for which AIMCO or any AIMCO Subsidiary acts as a general partner
and/or management agent, has not received any current physical inspection
reviews with a REAC score of less than 60 for which an MIO plan is
satisfactory to HUD has not been developed (or disclosing any exigent
health and safety matters which have not been resolved), or any management
agent's performance reviews that are graded as less than "Satisfactory" or,
as to state housing agencies, any physical inspection or management agent
reviews with an equivalent or otherwise substandard rating; (c) has no
"flags" or limited denials of participation, suspensions or debarments
currently in effect under the HUD 2530 Previous Participation Clearance
Procedures or any other applicable HUD regulations; (d) has not been
notified by HUD of any matters currently pending before the HUD
Departmental Enforcement Center; (e) has not received any notice from HUD
with respect to any audited financial statement for any year prior to 2000

audited financial statements in the timeframe required by HUD for the
calendar year 2000.

         Section 5.13     ABSENCE OF INDUCEMENT. In entering into the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party, AIMCO has not been induced
by, or relied upon, any representations, warranties or statements by Casden
not set forth or referred to in the Transaction Documents, the Schedules
thereto or the other documents required to be delivered thereby, whether or
not such representations, warranties or statements have actually been made
and AIMCO acknowledges that, in entering into the Transaction Documents to
which it is a party, Casden has been induced by and relied upon the
representations and warranties of AIMCO herein set forth, the information
set forth in the AIMCO Financial Statements and AIMCO SEC Reports and the

representations, warranties or statements as to the advisability of

                  (a) AFFECTED EMPLOYEES. At least thirty (30) days
prior to the Effective Time, Casden shall deliver to AIMCO a final list of
the employees of Casden or any Casden Subsidiary that will be given offers
of employment by either CommercialCo or the Development LLC (the
"Transferred Employees") indicating the entity which will offer employment
to each such employee. Casden acknowledges and agrees that immediately
following the Effective Time, pursuant to the Tri-Party Agreement,
Development LLC will offer, or cause CommercialCo to offer, employment to
the Transferred Employees. From and after the Effective Time, AIMCO shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume and honor the
obligations of Casden and the Casden Subsidiaries with respect to their
respective employees other than the Transferred Employees (the "Affected
Employees"). From and after the Effective Time, AIMCO shall be the employer
of the Affected Employees and shall have all rights accruing to an employer
with respect to the Affected Employees.

                  (b) VACATION AND RELATED BENEFITS. AIMCO shall, or

holiday, sick and personal days accrued but unused for each Affected
Employee under the policies and practices of Casden and the Casden
Subsidiaries.

                  (c) SERVICE CREDIT. In the event of any change in
the welfare benefits provided to an Affected Employee under any Casden
Benefit Plan, AIMCO shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i)
waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable
to the Affected Employee under such new or changed plan (except to the
extent that such conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply
under any Casden Benefit Plan) and (ii) provide each Affected Employee with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to any such change in
coverage in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under such new or changed plan to the extent not previously
reimbursed under any Casden Benefit Plan. AIMCO shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide each Affected Employee with credit for
all service with Casden and its Affiliates under each employee benefit
plan, policy, program or arrangement in which such Affected Employee is
eligible to participate, except to the extent the relevant benefits are
provided under any similar Casden Benefit Plan in which such Affected
Employee is entitled to participate, and except where such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service.

                  (d) WAIVER OF CONDITIONS. On and after the Closing
Date, AIMCO shall cause each AIMCO welfare plan to waive any pre-existing
condition exclusions and waiting periods (except to the extent that such
exclusions would have then applied or such waiting periods were not
satisfied under the Casden welfare plans) with respect to the Affected
Employees (and their beneficiaries).

                  (e) ASSUMPTION OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS.
On the Closing Date, AIMCO agrees to assume and adopt the collective

liability insurance for a period of not less than six years following the
Closing Date for each person covered by such insurance by Casden
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each of whom is listed on Section
7.13 of the Casden Disclosure Letter; provided, however, that AIMCO shall
be entitled to substitute existing policies with equivalent policies from
reputable and financially sound insurers with the same or better coverage
and amounts and containing terms and conditions no less favorable to such
directors, officers and general partners, provided that no gap in coverage
results from any such change or substitution.

         Section 7.14       BREACHES. Each party hereto agrees it shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto in writing prior to the Closing if
such party is aware of or has knowledge of another party's breach of any

specify in reasonable detail the nature and grounds for the alleged breach,
the representation, warranty or covenant to which such alleged breach
relates and a good faith estimate of the estimates, damages or losses which
are reasonably likely to result from such alleged breach if no curative
measures are taken.

trademarks set forth in Section 7.16 of the Casden Disclosure Letter and
any other names and trademarks to which Casden or any Casden Subsidiary has
a legal right or claim (collectively, the "Trademarks") without
restriction, including the ability to compete with AIMCO in any and all
markets. From and after the Effective Time, AIMCO admits the validity of,
and agrees not to challenge any, Trademark. AIMCO also agrees that any and
all rights that may be acquired by the use of the Trademarks by AIMCO
during the Transition Period (as defined in Section 7.16(c) below) shall
inure to the sole benefit of Development LLC. From and after the Effective
Time, AIMCO shall not use the Trademarks as part of its corporate name nor

or confusingly similar to the Trademarks. From and after the Effective
Time, AIMCO further agrees not to register any domain name or trademark
resembling or confusingly similar to the Trademarks with Network Systems,
Inc. or any other registration agency. If any application for registration
is, or has been, filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office
by AIMCO which is deemed by the United States Patent and Trademark Office
to be confusingly similar, deceptive or misleading with respect to any
Trademark, AIMCO shall abandon any such application or registration or,
from and after the Effective Time, assign it to Development LLC. AIMCO
shall reimburse Development LLC, for all the costs and expenses of any
oppositions, cancellation or related legal proceedings, including
attorney's fees, instigated by Development LLC, from and after the
Effective Time, in connection with any such registration or application.

                  (c) AIMCO and Casden acknowledge and agree that
pursuant to a separate agreement, Development LLC will agree that for a
period of 90 days from the Effective Time (the "Transition Period"),
Development LLC will not sue AIMCO for trademark infringement for use of
the Trademarks, and further provided that the Trademarks shall only be used
by AIMCO in the same manner in which they are currently used by Casden or
any Casden Subsidiary. AIMCO and Casden (or Development LLC, from and after
the Effective Time) may, by mutual written consent, agree to extend the
Transition Period for an additional period of time. However, any use of the
Trademarks beyond the Transition Period, shall constitute a material breach
of this Agreement and be actionable by Development LLC.

in connection with the Merger will be validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable and not subject to preemptive rights, and as to such other
matters as are customary in a transaction such as the Merger. Casden agrees
that the form of opinion attached hereto as Exhibit 8.3(c) shall be
acceptable to Casden and that the failure of AIMCO to deliver such opinion
shall constitute a breach of Section 7.9 by AIMCO unless such failure shall
be due solely to a change in law (statutory or case law) or regulation
occurring after the date hereof.

                  (d) MERGER OPINION. Unless a Taxable Election is
made pursuant to Section 2.2(f), Casden shall have received an opinion of
Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP (or another nationally recognized law firm
acceptable to Casden) that, based upon certificates and letters acceptable
to Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP (or another nationally recognized law firm
acceptable to Casden) dated as of the Closing Date, the Merger will qualify
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code (with
customary exceptions, assumptions and qualifications and based on customary
representations). Such opinion shall also be addressed to BA Casden
Investors, LLC, AIC, TCC and CIC. Casden agrees that an opinion
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 8.3(d)(i) hereto shall be
acceptable to Casden and that the failure of Casden to obtain delivery of
such opinion shall constitute a breach of Section 7.9 by Casden unless such
failure shall be due solely to (i) a change in the law (statutory or case
law) or regulation occurring after the date hereof or (ii) the failure of
AIMCO to deliver to such counsel an officers' certificate in substantially
the form attached hereto as Exhibit 8.3(d)(ii), in which case such failure
of AIMCO shall constitute a breach by AIMCO of Section 7.9 and shall not be
considered a breach by Casden of Section 7.9.

                  (e) OPINION OF AIMCO'S COUNSEL. AIMCO shall have
caused to be delivered to Casden and XYZ the opinion of Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (or another nationally known law firm acceptable
to Casden) to the effect that each of the Transaction Documents to which
AIMCO is a party constitutes the valid and binding obligation of AIMCO and
AIMCO OP, and that such agreements are enforceable against AIMCO and AIMCO
OP, in accordance with their terms (with customary exceptions, assumptions
and qualifications and based on customary representations). Casden agrees
that an opinion substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 8.3(e) hereto
shall be acceptable to Casden and that the failure of AIMCO to deliver such
opinion shall constitute a breach of Section 7.9 by AIMCO unless such
failure shall be due solely to a change in law (statutory or case law) or
regulation occurring after the date hereof.

                  (f) TRADING OF AIMCO COMMON STOCK. AIMCO Common
Stock shall be listed and admitted for trading on the NYSE and there shall
have occurred trading of AIMCO Common Stock on each of the five (5) trading
days immediately prior to the Closing Date.

                  (g) LISTING OF SHARES. The shares of AIMCO Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger shall have been approved for
listing on the NYSE upon official notice of issuance. The parties
acknowledge and agree that if Casden elects to waive this condition in the
event it is not satisfied, such waiver will not constitute a waiver of (or
absolve AIMCO from liability for) the breach of the covenant in Section
7.31.

                  (h) AIMCO REQUIRED STATUTORY APPROVALS.  Each of the AIMCO
Required Statutory Approvals shall have been obtained.

                                 ARTICLE IX

                     TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

         Section 9.1       TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing Date, whether before or after obtaining the
Casden Stockholders' Approval, only:

                  (a) by mutual written consent of the respective Boards of
Directors of Casden and AIMCO;

                  (b) (i) by either AIMCO or Casden if there has been
any breach by the other party of any representation or warranty set forth
in this Agreement, or failure by the other party to comply with any of its
covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement and which breach or
failure individually or together with the other breaches or failures by
such other party that have not been cured would result in losses, costs,
damages or expenses to the terminating party, if the Transactions were
consummated that would reasonably be expected to exceed $100 million, and
which breach or failure has not been cured within 30 days following receipt
by the breaching or failing party of notice of such breach or failure or
adequate assurance of such cure shall not have been given by or on behalf
of the breaching or failing party within such 30 day period or (ii) by
AIMCO or Casden, if any state or federal law, order, rule or regulation is
adopted or issued after the date hereof, which has the effect, as supported
by the written opinion of outside counsel for such party, of prohibiting
any of the Transactions, or if any court of competent jurisdiction in the
United States or any state shall have issued an order, judgment or decree
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting any of the
Transactions, and such order, judgment or decree shall have become final
and non-appealable; provided, however, that the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement as a result of any such injunction or prohibition shall have
used all reasonable efforts to remove such injunction or overturn such
prohibition;

                  (c) by either AIMCO or Casden, by written notice to
the other party, if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before
the six month anniversary of the date hereof (the "Termination Date")
subject to AIMCO's and Casden's right to postpone the Closing pursuant to
the proviso in Section 3.1; provided, however, that in the event the
parties have not obtained approval of the Transactions by HUD by the
Termination Date, such date may be extended at the election of AIMCO or
Casden for one-month periods (up to an additional six months) pending such
approval; provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 9.1(c) shall not be available to any party whose failure
to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before the
Termination Date; or

                  (d) by Casden if (i) all of AIMCO's conditions to
closing set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 have been satisfied, (ii)
within 10 days of receiving notice of Casden's intent to terminate pursuant
to this Section 9.1(d), AIMCO has failed to close and (iii) at such time
AIMCO is not entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article IX.

         Section 9.2       EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 by either Casden or
AIMCO, except as expressly provided in Section 9.3(a) below, no party
hereto shall have any liability to any other party with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and this Agreement shall
be of no further force or effect; provided, however that notwithstanding
the foregoing, Sections 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.6, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4,
10.5, 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8 shall survive the termination indefinitely
(unless otherwise specifically provided therein).

         Section 9.3       TERMINATION FEES.

                  (a) CASDEN LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. If the Merger is not
consummated and Casden terminates this Agreement pursuant to Sections
9.1(b) or 9.1(d) above, (i) Casden shall be entitled to receive the Escrow
Amount from the Escrow Agent and (ii) AIMCO shall pay to Casden in cash
liquidated damages in the amount of $50 million (the amounts received by
Casden pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the
"Liquidated Damages"); provided, however, that Casden shall not be entitled
to receive the Liquidated Damages if AIMCO is entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 above. The payment of the Liquidated
Damages shall be compensation and liquidated damages for the loss suffered
by Casden as the result of the failure to consummate the Merger and the
Related Transactions and to avoid the difficulty of determining damages
under the circumstances, and AIMCO and AIMCO OP shall not have any
liability to Casden, other than the payment of the Liquidated Damages if
the Merger is not consummated.

                  (b) NO PENALTY. The parties agree that the
agreements contained in this Section 9.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and constitute liquidated
damages and not a penalty.

         Section 9.4       AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto (or by Casden pursuant to Section 2.2(g)) at any time before
or after the Casden Stockholders' Approval and prior to the Effective Time,
subject to the requirements of the MGCL. Other than pursuant to Section
2.2(g), this Agreement may not be amended except by a written instrument
signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

         Section 9.5       WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
a party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party
contained herein, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Any agreement
on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party.

         Section 9.6       DAMAGES. Notwithstanding any other provision
herein, the parties agree that if the Merger is consummated, the sole
remedy of any such party for any other party's breach of representations or
warranties or failure to comply with covenants, and any failure to satisfy
any condition, shall be the right to collect damages for any breach of
representations or warranties or failure to comply with covenants or to
satisfy any condition, to the extent provided in the Master Indemnification
Agreement (or, with respect to Tax matters, the Tax Indemnity Agreement).
The representations and warranties of the parties contained herein shall
survive the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the Master
Indemnification Agreement. The waiver of any condition based on the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to
indemnification or other remedy based on such representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements; provided, however, that if either party has
knowledge prior to the Closing Date of any breach of any covenant or any
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
prior to the Closing Date and such party did not comply with its
Pre-Closing Notice (as defined in the Master Indemnification Agreement)
obligation pursuant to the Master Indemnification Agreement, such party
shall not be entitled to indemnification under the Master Indemnification
Agreement for such breach or inaccuracy, except as pursuant to the Tax
Indemnity Agreement.

         Section 10.3      MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement, the Related
Transaction Documents, the Confidentiality Agreement and the documents and
instruments referred to herein and therein constitute the entire agreement
and supersede all other prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements
and understandings among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned by
any party and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York, including Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the
New York General Obligations Law and New York Civil Practice Laws and Rules
327(b), except to the extent the provisions of this Agreement (including
the documents or instruments referred to herein) are expressly governed by
or derive their authority from the MGCL.

         Section 10.4      INTERPRETATION. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to Sections or Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section or
Exhibit of this Agreement, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation."

         Section 10.5      COUNTERPARTS; EFFECT. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be
an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.

         Section 10.6      PARTIES' INTEREST. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon
any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement, except that the directors, officers and
general partners covered by the insurance referred to in Section 7.13 shall
have the right to enforce such provisions.

         Section 10.7      ENFORCEMENT.

                           (a) The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached until the consummation of the Merger. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States located
in the State of New York or in New York state court, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled pursuant to this Agreement,
the Master Indemnification Agreement or the Tax Indemnity Agreement;
provided, however, that following the consummation of the Merger, specific
performance of the terms of this Agreement (other than under Section 7.30)
shall no longer be available.

                           (b) In addition, each of the parties hereto (i)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any federal court
located in the State of New York or any New York state court in the event
any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the Transactions, (ii)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court and (iii) agrees that
it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement, the Related
Transaction Documents or any of the Transactions in any court other than a
federal or state court sitting in the State of New York.

         Section 10.8      SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this Agreement
shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other
provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application
thereof to any Person or entity or any circumstance, is invalid or
unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted
therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the
intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
Persons, entities or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity
or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect
the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof, in any other jurisdiction.
