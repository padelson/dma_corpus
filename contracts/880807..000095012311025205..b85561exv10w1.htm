Sellers are the sole shareholders of the Company and each of Sellers holds the
Shares set forth in Appendix A in the Company at the time of Signing and the
Closing, provided that (i) any Sellers who are employees of the Group
Companies (other than the Directors) at the time of Signing but will not be
employed by the Group Companies at the time of the Closing, or have been
notified of termination of employment or have submitted a notice of
termination prior to the Closing, shall sell and deliver their Shares to the
Company prior to Closing, and Sellers shall cause the Company to redeem such
Shares, in accordance with the Shareholders Agreement and be excluded from
the definition of "Sellers" and (ii) any Persons who will become employees of
the Group Companies after the time of Signing and before the time of Closing
and who will receive Shares in connection with their employment in accordance

the form of Appendix 2.1 and be included in the definition of "Sellers". For
the purpose of a valid private placement under the applicable US regulations,
the Company and Sellers undertake not to transfer Shares to such new
employees after the time of Signing and before the time of Closing that
the number of the Non-Accredited Investors and the Non-Sophisticated
Investors in the United States holding any Shares would be more than thirty-
five (35). Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Purchaser, the maximum
amount permitted to be used by the Company to redeem Shares pursuant to item

prior to Closing update Appendix 4.2 as a result of possible changes in the
ownership of the Company based on this Section 2.1. 

   

There have been no repayments of any kind of the share capital to the
shareholders of the Company, except in relation to redemption of shares by

3 Object of the Agreement 

    

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, Sellers hereby
sell and Purchaser hereby purchases the Shares held by Sellers, constituting
one hundred per cent (100%) of the issued and outstanding shares in the
Company, effective at Closing. 

  

4 Purchase Price 

   

4.1 Purchase Price  

   

The Purchase Price for the Shares owned and held by Sellers shall be the
aggregate of EUR one hundred and ninety million (190,000,000) (the "Purchase
Price"). 

   

It is specifically agreed and acknowledged by the Parties that the Shares are
acquired by Purchaser on an interest-bearing debt-free basis, save for the
government loans, as specified in Appendix 7.15, not exceeding EUR two
million one hundred and thirty-eight thousand (2,138,000) at Closing
(principal amount). Notwithstanding the aforesaid, the Company is entitled to
use the credit limits in force at the Signing Date hereof with Nordea Bank
Finland Plc and Svenska Handelsbanken AB (publ), Branch Operation in Finland,
for short-term working capital purposes in the ordinary course of business
of the Company for the purpose of manufacturing products required to be
delivered, provided that the Company informs Purchaser in advance of its
intent to use any such credit lines. For the sake of clarity, if the Company
utilizes any such short-term credit facilities prior to Closing in accordance
with this Section 4.1, such borrowing shall under no circumstances result in
any adjustment of the Purchase Price to the extent the outstanding borrowings
for working capital purposes under such facilities, together with any
outstanding borrowings from Semikron International GmbH, at Closing will not
exceed EUR two million one hundred thousand (2,100,000). 

  

4.2 Payment of Purchase Price 

    

At Closing, Purchaser shall pay 

   

(i) EUR one hundred and seventy-one million (171,000,000), _i.e._ ninety per
cent (90%) of the Purchase Price in cash to Sellers joint bank account and
in unregistered shares of Purchaser Common Stock delivered in accordance with
this Section 4.2 (jointly, the "Payment"); and  ##### 

 

 

9   

(ii) EUR nineteen million (19,000,000), _i.e._ ten per cent (10%) of the
Purchase Price, in cash and in unregistered shares of Purchaser Common Stock
to escrow (the "Escrow Payment") delivered in accordance with this Section
4.2 and Section 4.4 below. 

   

The Purchase Price shall be paid and divided among Sellers as follows: 

   

(a) Sellers other than the Directors and the Minor Sellers will receive at
Closing approximately 73% of their portion of the Purchase Price in cash and
approximately 27% in unregistered shares of Purchaser Common Stock (subject
to certain restrictions pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement) as set forth
in Appendix 4.2. The number shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued and
delivered as part of the Payment to such Sellers at Closing will be
calculated on the basis of (i) the average closing price of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock in the Nasdaq Global Market during the twenty
(20) trading-day period ending on the second Business Day in the United
States preceding the Closing Date and (ii) the USD/EUR exchange rate
published in Financial Times (European print edition) on the second Business
Day preceding the Closing Date. The Parties shall jointly prepare a
calculation of the cash and the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock to
be paid to each such Seller on the last Business Day preceding the
Closing Date. 

   

(b) The Directors will receive at Closing approximately 40% of their portion
of the Purchase Price in cash and approximately 60% in unregistered shares of
Purchaser Common Stock (subject to certain lock-up restrictions pursuant to
the Stockholders Agreement). The cash to be paid and the number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock to be issued and delivered as part of the Payment to
Directors at Closing are set forth opposite to the name of each Director in
Appendix 4.2. The number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock has been
calculated on the basis of (i) the average closing price of USD 26.002
for shares of Purchaser Common Stock in the Nasdaq Global Market during the
ten (10) trading-day period ending on the last Business Day in the United
States preceding the Signing Date and (ii) the USD/EUR exchange rate of
1.3799 published in Financial Times (European print edition) on the last
Business Day preceding the Signing Date. 

   

(c) The Minor Sellers will receive at Closing 100% of their portion of the
Purchase Price in cash as set forth opposite to the name of each Minor Seller
in Appendix 4.2. 

   

In no circumstances may the total number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock
issuable pursuant to this Section 4.2 exceed 19.9% of the total number of
shares of Purchaser Common Stock outstanding prior to such issuance. 

  

4.3 Allocation of Purchase Price 

    

The total Purchase Price shall be allocated between Sellers according to
Appendix 4.2. The Parties acknowledge that, according to the Shareholders
Agreement, each Seller shall be entitled to sell and transfer its shares in
the Company on equal terms and conditions in connection with the exit, _i.e._
the sale of the Shares in the Company. Due to the fact that a precondition
set by Purchaser for the purchase of the Shares by Purchaser is that the
Directors receive a large portion of the Purchase Price in Purchaser Common
Stock (with lock-up restrictions), the Directors have requested a higher
purchase price for their Shares as a precondition for accepting the joint exit
by Sellers. Sellers have therefore with the consent of Purchaser agreed that
the Directors will receive a higher purchase price per Share than the other
Sellers due to the said obligation to accept as consideration a large portion
of the Purchase  ##### 

 

 

10   

Price in Purchaser Common Stock (with lock-up restrictions). By receiving a
higher purchase price per Share Sellers consider that the Directors will be
put in an equal position compared to the other Sellers. Purchaser shall not
have any responsibility as to the division of the Purchase Price between
Sellers. Directors shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and the
Company from and against any tax and other liabilities resulting to Purchaser
or the Company as a result of such allocation of Purchase Price. At Closing,
the Shareholders Agreement will cease to be in force without any outstanding
claims and/or obligations among and between Sellers or involving
the Company. 

  

4.4 Escrow Arrangement 

    

At Closing, Purchaser shall make the Escrow Payment to the Escrow Agent in
accordance with Section 4.2 (ii) above. The number of Purchaser Common Stock
to be placed in escrow pursuant to Section 4.2 and this Section 4.4 shall be
calculated on the basis of the closing price of Purchaser Common Stock in the
Nasdaq Global Market on the second Business Day preceding the Closing Date.
The Escrow Payment shall be released to Sellers twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date in accordance with the Escrow Agreement ("Release Date") subject
to the following paragraphs of this Section 4.4. The Escrow Agreement
specifies the detailed terms of the escrow arrangement. 

   

If Purchaser has asserted a Claim by delivering a written notice to Sellers on
or before the expiry of the time period set out in Section 9.2.2, _i.e._
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, and Sellers do not dispute such
claim by delivering a written notice to Purchaser within thirty (30) days
following receipt by Sellers or such notice, the Parties shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to release and pay the amount of such claim to Purchaser from
the Escrow Payment. The balance between the amount, to which Purchaser may be
entitled to and the Escrow Payment, shall be released and paid to Sellers. 

   

If any dispute regarding a breach of this Agreement or the amount by which the
Purchase Price shall be reduced arises, such dispute shall be resolved and
finally determined by arbitration pursuant to Section 12.9 below. Upon the
final resolution and determination of such dispute by the arbitral tribunal,
the Escrow Agent shall arrange for the disbursement of the Escrow Payment to
which Purchaser or Sellers are entitled according to such arbitral award. 

   

Purchaser and Sellers shall, thirty (30) days from the Release Date, jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent to immediately release to Sellers the Escrow
Payment, less any amount at dispute. If no claim under this Agreement has
been made by Purchaser on the Release Date, at the latest, and Purchaser has
confirmed this in writing to the Escrow Agent, Purchaser and Sellers shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to immediately release to Sellers the
Escrow Payment. 

  

5 Transfer of Title and Assignment 

    

Subject to the fulfilment or waiver of the conditions precedent for Closing
set forth in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 below, each Seller hereby agrees to
transfer all of the Shares held by him/her/it by executing the respective
share transfer form attached hereto in Appendix 5 as of the Closing Date. The
full and unrestricted ownership of and title and risk to the Shares shall
pass from Sellers to Purchaser at the Closing Date upon the occurrence of the
Closing. 

   

Each of Sellers waives in favour of Purchaser any pre-emptive, redemption or
other rights which such Seller has in respect of any of the Shares held by
any other Seller. Sellers undertake to cause the Company not to exercise any
pre-emptive, redemption or other right the Company may be entitled to in
respect of any of the Shares prior to and up to Closing.  #####

register of the Company and register Purchaser as the owner of the Shares
provided that Purchaser presents evidence that the transfer tax levied on the
sale of the Shares has been paid in full;  
      
    | 6.4.8  |   | Sellers shall ensure that each Board member of the
Group Companies delivers to Purchaser written resignations from the Board of
the Group Company in question effective on the Closing Date; and  
      
    | 6.4.9  |   | Sellers shall provide evidence that dividends
amounting to totally EUR five million (5,000,000) has prior to Closing been
decided upon and paid to Sellers.  
   

   

All measures taken in connection with the Closing shall be considered to have
occurred simultaneously as a part of a single transaction and no delivery
shall be considered to have been made until each such measure has been
completed. 

  

6.5 Extraordinary General Meetings 

    

Purchaser shall on the Closing Date cause extraordinary general meetings of
the shareholders of the Group Companies to be held in order to elect new
Boards of Directors. 

  

6.6 Reasonable Efforts to Close 

    

Each Party shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
conditions precedent as provided in Section 6.2 and 6.3 to be fulfilled as
soon as possible and to have all deliveries as provided in Section 6.4 made
timely and properly. Each Party shall execute all documents and take all
actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein and to obtain in a timely
manner all necessary waivers, consents and approvals and to effect all
necessary registrations and filings. 

   

If the Closing has not taken place by 30 May 2011 (the "Long-Stop Date") due
to the fact that all of the conditions precedent set forth in Sections 6.2
and 6.3 above have not been fulfilled or waived, both Sellers and Purchaser
may, subject to the following paragraph, terminate this Agreement without
incurring any liabilities towards the other Party, provided, however, that in
the event the Closing has not taken place on or before the Long-Stop Date as
a result of pending satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in
Section 6.2.1 and 6.3.1, the Long-Stop Date shall be extended automatically
by ninety (90) days except in the event the relevant governmental authorities
have informed Purchaser in writing that they will not grant an approval
or consent necessary to permit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereunder. 

   

The right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 6.6 shall not be
available to any Party whose failure to fulfil any obligation under this
Agreement shall be the cause of the failure of Closing to occur on or before
such date and such Party shall, in addition to any remedies available under
this Agreement, be liable to the other Party (on a several and not jointly
basis) for all reasonable expenses of the other Party incurred in connection
with, or in preparation for, the transaction contemplated by this  ##### 

 

 

14   

Agreement. For the sake of clarity, a condition precedent for Closing not
being fulfilled is not considered to have been caused by a Party if such
Party has made all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the
condition precedent will be achieved and fulfilled. 

  

7 Representations and Warranties of Sellers 

    

Sellers hereby give the following representations and warranties
("Warranties") as of the date hereof and as of Closing (unless another date

7.10 Intellectual Property Rights 

    

To Sellers Knowledge, a Group Company owns, or has valid licenses or other
agreements to use, the Intellectual Property Rights used or held for use by
the Group Companies, free and clear of all security interests other than as
described in Appendix 7.10 (a). The products manufactured and sold and
services provided by the Group Companies do not, to Sellers Knowledge,
infringe or otherwise misuse the Intellectual Property Rights of any third
parties. 

   

Appendix 1.46 contains a complete and accurate list of all Registered IP.
All registration, renewal and maintenance and other official fees due in
respect of all Registered IP have been paid in full. All Registered IP is, to
the extent registered and granted, owned solely by, and is registered or
applied for in the sole name of, a Group Company. To Sellers Knowledge all
Registered IP that is granted, is valid and enforceable and there has been no
act or omission by such Group Company that would jeopardize its validity,
subsistence or enforceability. All Intellectual Property Rights are legally
and beneficially owned or used by a Group Company and are free from any
encumbrances, except as described in Appendix 7.10 (a). 

   

The use of the Business IP and Business Information does not, to Sellers
Knowledge, infringe or otherwise misuse the Intellectual Property Rights of
any third party. Neither a Group Company nor Sellers have received any notice
of any claim or a threat of any claim, from any third party, and no third
party claims are pending, challenging the right to use the Business IP or
Business Information or alleging any violation, infringement, misuse or
misappropriation by a Group Company, of Intellectual Property Rights or
indicating that the failure to take a licence under any Intellectual
Property Rights would result in any such claim. 

   

Appendix 7.10 (b) contains a complete list of all licences granted under the
Business IP by the Group Companies to third parties ("Licences Out") and all
licences under Intellectual Property Rights granted to any Group Company by
third parties ("Licences In"). The Group Companies have fully and duly made
all royalty and other payments under any of the Licences In (except where
failure to make such payments would not constitute a breach of contract) and
have to all material extent received all of the licence fees, royalties and
other payments due and payable under any of the Licences Out, if any.
To Sellers Knowledge, there has been no uncured material breaches by any
party of any of the terms of any of the Licences In or the Licences Out. To
Sellers Knowledge, none of the Licences In or Licences Out is terminable by
reason of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (other than due to a
possible change of control provision in such Licenses In or Licenses Out).
Where any Licence In or Licence Out depends for its validity and
enforceability upon its registration with relevant authorities in
any relevant jurisdiction, such registration has, to Sellers Knowledge, been
carried out. 

   

Except as set forth in Appendix 7.10 (a), none of the Business IP was
generated by employees or former employees of any Group Company, consultants,
university professors or other university employees or research students or
other third parties under circumstances in which the generator is entitled to
payment in respect of the use or exploitation of the Business IP by any Group
Company or has a pre-emption right over any of the Registered IP. 

   

A Group Company owns the Intellectual Property Rights in all of the Software
(except any that is commercially available off the shelf) used by the Group
Companies or has access to the source code of such Software and has a free
right to modify the Software. None of the Software developed by or for a
Group Company is based on open source software under terms which require the
Group Company or the developer to disclose the source code of such developed
Software to the general public. 

   

The Hardware is either owned or leased by, and is under the control of, a
Group Company and is not subject to any encumbrance except as set forth in
Appendix 7.10 (a). All material Hardware is  ##### 

 

 

19

applicable specifications, has not materially failed to function in the last
12 months, to Sellers Knowledge is not infected with any materially damaging
viruses and has not within the last 12 months been so infected, has been
satisfactorily and regularly maintained and has the benefit of appropriate
maintenance and support agreements, complete and accurate copies of which
have been disclosed to Purchaser. The Hardware has sufficient capacity and
performance to meet current business requirements of the Group Companies. 

  

7.11 Employment and Pensions 

    

There are no Employee Benefit Plans (together with all material documents
related thereto) except as listed in Appendix 7.11 (a). Each Employee Benefit
Plan is in compliance with all applicable laws in all material respect and
has been administered and operated in all material respects in accordance
with its terms. Full payment has been made of all amounts which any of the
Group Companies is required, under applicable law or under any Employee
Benefit Plan or any agreement relating to any Employee Benefit Plan to which
any of the Group Companies is a party, to have paid as contributions or
premiums thereto. 

   

To the extent required by applicable law and the Accounting Principles,
provision(s) have been made in the Audited Annual Accounts, for the full
amount of all present and future liabilities in respect of pension
undertakings to be paid to current or former Directors, or to officers or
other employees of the Group Companies. All statutory contributions in
respect of pension undertakings to current or former Directors, or
to officers or other employees of a Group Company have been made when due. 

   

The Group Companies are in compliance in all material respect with all
applicable laws, rules and regulations in respect of employment and
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, working hours and
their monitoring and wages (including but not limited to applicable
collective bargaining agreements) and have not and are not engaged in any
unfair labour practice. There is no labour strike, dispute, slowdown
or stoppage actually pending or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened against or
involving any of the Group Companies. There are no pending employment-related
disputes with employees, former employees, officers or directors of any of
the Group Companies and the Group Companies have not received notice of any
outstanding claim relating to their non-compliance with any employment,
labour or related laws except as disclosed in Appendix 7.11 (b). 

   

All the employment agreements of the Group Companies are, to Sellers
Knowledge, within the normal scopes of employment agreements and do not
provide for benefits to the employees or liabilities to a Group Company,
which are exceptional in the field of business conducted by such Group
Company. 

   

Neither a Group Company nor, to Sellers Knowledge, any employee, officer or
director of a Group Company is in violation to any material extent of any
term of any employment agreement or any other similar contract or agreement
in respect of services to such Group Company. No employee, officer or
director of a Group Company has given notice of termination or, to Sellers
Knowledge, threatened to terminate, his or her employment agreement with a
Group Company. 

  

7.12 Environmental Matters 

    

The Group Companies currently hold all material environmental permits,
licenses and approvals of governmental authorities and agencies required for
the current operations of the Group Companies. 

   

No Group Company has received notice of any violation of any applicable
environmental statute, regulation, ordinance or decree binding upon it which
has not been substantially corrected, except for violations that could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  ##### 

 

 

20   

The Group Companies are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws
and regulations, except for such non-compliance that could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and no notices of claims have
been made or proceedings have been instituted or are pending or, to Sellers
Knowledge, threatened against Sellers or a Group Company in respect of any
non-compliance with such environmental laws or regulations. 

   

There are no facts, circumstances or conditions relating to the past or
present business or operations of the Group Companies or any of their
respective predecessors (including the disposal of any wastes, hazardous
substances or other materials at any location), or to any real property or
facility at any time owned, leased, or operated by the Group Companies or any
of their respective predecessors, that would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any claim, proceeding or action, or to any liability, under any
environmental law or regulation or permit which has had or could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Finland Plc and Svenska Handelsbanken AB (publ), Branch Operation in
Finland. 

  

7.16 Insurance 

    

The insurance policies currently in effect in respect of the Group Companies
are set out in Appendix 7.16 and will remain in full force and effect through
the Closing and no action has been taken which could make any of them void or
unenforceable as of the Closing. The insurance policies provide, to Sellers
Knowledge, the types and amounts of insurance coverage normal and customary
for similar companies. All premiums have been duly paid and nothing has been
done whereby any of such insurances may be avoided or vitiated and there are
no insurance claims pending or outstanding nor, to Sellers Knowledge, any
incidents which could give rise to an insurance claim. The
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not cause the termination or
expiry of the insurance coverage pursuant to this Section 7.16. 

  

7.17 Product Liability and Warranty Claims 

    

No claim, which could result in a Material Adverse Effect in respect of any
product, manufactured or sold or any service delivered by a Group Company is
unsettled or is subject to any dispute between a Group Company and any third
party. To Sellers Knowledge, there are no threatened warranty or product
liability claims or any series defect with respect to any such product or
service, which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. 

  

7.18 Dividends 

    

The Company will prior to Closing decide and pay dividend to Sellers in the
amount of EUR five million (5,000,000). Otherwise, the Company has not since
its foundation declared or paid any dividend to Sellers nor is the Company
under any obligation to make any such payments to Sellers. 

  

7.19 Subsidiaries 

    

Appendix 7.1 as well as Section 2.2 set forth the name of each Subsidiary and,
with respect to each such Subsidiary, the jurisdiction in which it is
incorporated or organized, the number of shares of its authorized capital
stock, the number and class of shares thereof duly issued and outstanding and
the number of shares of or the amount of equity owned by the Company. Each
Subsidiary is either a corporation or limited liability company duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
country of incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
conducted. Each Subsidiary is duly qualified or authorized to do business and
is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which it owns or
leases real property and each other jurisdiction in which the conduct of its
business or the ownership of its properties requires such qualification or
authorization. 

   

The outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary (if applicable) are
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and all such shares or other
equity interests represented as being owned by the Company are owned by it
free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances. There is no existing
option, warrant, call, right or contract to which any Subsidiary is a party
requiring, and there are no convertible securities of any such subsidiary
outstanding which upon conversion would require, the issuance of any shares
or other equity interests of any such Subsidiary or other
securities convertible into shares or other equity interests of any such
Subsidiary.  ##### 

 

 

23   

There are no contracts to which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is a
party or by which any of them is bound to (i) repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any shares, or other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary or
(ii) vote or dispose of any shares, or other equity or voting interest in,
any Subsidiary. There are no irrevocable proxies and no voting agreements
with respect to any shares of, or other equity or voting interest in, any
Subsidiary. 

  

7.20 Compliance with Laws; Anti-Bribery Laws 

   

       | (a)  |   | Each of the Group Companies has complied and is
in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and orders in all
material respects. None of the Group Companies has received any notice that
any violation of the foregoing is being alleged.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | The Group Companies have not, and, to Sellers
Knowledge, no director, officer, agent, employee or other person associated
with or acting on behalf of the Group Companies, has, (i) made, paid or
received any unlawful bribes, kickbacks or other similar payments to or from
any Person (including any customer or supplier) or Governmental Entity, (ii)
made or paid any contributions, directly or indirectly, to a domestic or
foreign political party or candidate, (iii) made or paid any improper payment
in violation of Anti-Bribery Laws, (iv) established or maintained any
unrecorded fund of corporate monies or other assets, or (v) made any false or
fictitious entry on the books or records of the Group Companies. The internal
accounting controls of the Group Companies are reasonably adequate to detect
any of the foregoing involving funds of a Group Company. "Anti-Bribery Laws"
shall mean any anti-bribery, anti-corruption or similar law of any
jurisdiction where one or more properties owned or leased by the
Group Companies are located or where the Group Companies transact business or
any other jurisdiction, if applicable, including but not limited to such laws
in China and the United States.  
   

  

7.21 Affiliate Transactions 

    

Except as set forth in Appendix 7.21, there are no contracts between the
Group Companies, on the one hand, and Sellers or any of their Affiliates
(other than the Group Companies) and their respective directors or officers,
on the other hand. 

   

Except as set forth in Appendix 7.21, Sellers, their Affiliates (other than
the Group Companies) or any of their respective directors or officers and the
directors and officers of the Group Companies do not possess, directly or
indirectly, any financial interest in, or hold a position as a director,
officer or employee of, any person which is a competitor or potential
competitor of the Group Companies. 

  

7.22 No Other Warranties 

    

It is specifically stated and agreed that Sellers have not made, and Purchaser
has not relied on, any other expressed or implied warranties regarding the
Shares, or the Group Companies or their businesses other than as contained in
this Section 7\. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing,
Sellers make no warranty to Purchaser with respect to and shall have no
liability to Purchaser based on any financial projection or forecast relating
to the Group Companies or the future businesses of the Group Companies. With
respect to any such projection or forecast that may have been delivered by or
on behalf of Sellers to Purchaser, Purchaser acknowledges that (a) there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections and
forecasts, (b) it is familiar with such uncertainties, (c) it is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all such projections and forecasts so furnished to it and (d) it shall have
no claim against Sellers with respect thereto. For the sake of clarity,
except as set forth in Section 7.14 (Suppliers and  ##### 

 

 

24   

Customers), it is acknowledged by Purchaser that Sellers do not give any
warranty regarding the reaction by customers or otherwise by the market to
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

7.23 Disclosure 

    

None of this Agreement, any of its Appendices or certificate delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, the Disclosure Material, the Disclosure Letter or
the Updated Disclosure Letter contains any untrue statement of a material
fact, or omits any statement of a material fact necessary to make the
statements contained herein or therein not misleading. To Sellers Knowledge,
no information which would, from a general objective perspective, be material
to a reasonable purchaser of the Shares has been left undisclosed to
Purchaser. 

  

8 Representations and Warranties of Purchaser 

    

Purchaser hereby gives the following representations and warranties as at the
date hereof, which representations and warranties shall be renewed and given
also on Closing: 

  

8.1 Existence 

    

Purchaser is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and has full corporate power and all
necessary licenses, permits and authorisations to carry on its businesses as
conducted at the Closing. 

  

8.2 Power and Authority of Purchaser 

    

Purchaser has the full legal and corporate power to enter into this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and the
fulfilment of the terms hereof will not result in a breach of any judgment,
decree or order of any national or supranational court, governmental or other
body, any applicable law or regulation or the certification of incorporation
or by-laws of Purchaser. 

  

8.3 Financing 

    

Purchaser has sufficient funds available to purchase the Shares and pay the
Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement and to satisfy its other
obligations pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

8.4 Issuance of Shares 

    

Purchaser has the full legal and corporate power to issue and transfer as part
payment of the Purchase Price the Purchaser Common Stock as set forth in this
Agreement and in the Stockholders Agreement. 

  

8.5 No Basis for Claims 

    

As at Signing, Purchaser is not, based on its due diligence review or
otherwise, aware of any matter or circumstance that would constitute a breach
by Sellers of any terms of this Agreement, which breach would entitle
Purchaser to make a Claim pursuant to Section 9\. Purchaser shall, as
stipulated in Section 11.6 below, between Signing and Closing inform Sellers
of all events and facts, which it becomes aware of and which Purchaser
believes would result in a breach of this Agreement by Sellers.  ##### 

 

 

25  

9 Indemnity 

   

9.1 Indemnity of Purchaser  

   

Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.2 below, Sellers hereby
agree to indemnify Purchaser against any direct damage, loss or cost ("Loss")
actually incurred by Purchaser or the Group Companies as a direct result of
any breach by Sellers of any of the Warranties (for the purposes of this
Section 9 without giving effect to any "materiality," "material adverse
effect" or similar materiality qualification) or any other terms of this
Agreement giving rise to a Claim, provided that Sellers have failed to
rectify the breach (to the extent such breach can be rectified) within ten
(10) Business Days of having received a notice pursuant to Section 9.2.2. It
is expressly stated herein that all consequential and indirect losses and
costs, including, without limitation, loss of revenues, profits, cost
savings, synergies or other similar advantages, are excluded from Sellers
liability under this Agreement, except if the Claim is due to fraud or wilful
misconduct by Sellers or if the Claim relates to a breach by Sellers of the
Warranties set forth in Section 7.9 (Taxes), 7.12 (Environmental Matters) and
7.20 (b) (Anti-Bribery Laws). 

   

For the sake of clarity it is stated here and agreed hereby that any amount
payable by Sellers to Purchaser under this Section 9 shall be paid primarily
and first from the Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. It is expressly agreed that as of the first day after twelve (12)
months after the Closing Date the Warrantors shall solely assume liability
for the Warranties granted and for possible Claims presented by Purchaser
after such date under this Agreement and the other Sellers shall thus be
released from liability under this Agreement as per such date other than
in respect of Claims made prior to such date. 

   

Any amount payable by Sellers to Purchaser under this Section 9 shall be
treated for all purposes as a reduction of the Purchase Price. This remedy
shall be exclusive and it is specifically agreed that no other remedy,
including (but not limited to) the right to damages or to terminate or
rescind this Agreement, shall be available to Purchaser. 

  

9.2 Limitation of Sellers Liability 

   

9.2.1 Monetary Limitations  

   

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Purchasers right to indemnification for all Claims under this Agreement
shall be limited to the Escrow Payment, _i.e._ EUR nineteen million
(19,000,000), which constitutes Sellers maximum aggregate liability under
this Agreement on any ground, except for any Claims due to breach by Sellers
of the Warranties set forth in Section 7.1 (Ownership of Shares and Authority
of Sellers), Section 7.2 (Existence), Section 7.9 (Taxes), Section
7.10 (Intellectual Property Rights), Section 7.12 (Environmental Matters) and
7.20 (b) (Anti-Bribery Laws) or for any Claims due to fraud or wilful
misconduct by Sellers. Sellers and, after twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date, the Warrantors maximum liability for Warranties set forth in
Section 7.9 (Taxes), Section 7.10 (Intellectual Property Rights), Section
7.12 (Environmental Matters) and 7.20 (b) (Anti-Bribery Laws) pursuant to
Section 9.3 shall be limited to fifty percent of the Purchase
Price (including the Escrow Payment). For the sake of clarity, it is
expressly understood and agreed that the Directors shall not have any
obligation to supplement the Escrow Payment, if e.g. the market price of the
Purchaser Common Stock being held on Escrow Account decreases, but such risk
shall be assumed by Purchaser. Further, should the entire Escrow Payment made
by the Directors not be sufficient, as a result of decreased value of the
Purchaser Common Stock, to cover the Directors full pro rata portion of any
Claims under this Agreement, Purchaser shall not be entitled to claim any
such shortfall from the other Sellers who have made their Escrow Payment in
cash.  ##### 

 

 

26   

No reduction of the Purchase Price shall be made due to a breach of this
Agreement, unless the total amount of the Claims, which Purchaser may make in
this respect under this Agreement, amounts to or exceeds EUR five hundred
thousand (500,000). If such Claims amount to EUR five hundred thousand
(500,000) in the aggregate, the reduction shall be made for the amount
exceeding such threshold. No individual Claim, or series of Claims arising
from substantially identical facts or circumstances, which is less than EUR
fifty thousand (50,000) shall be taken into account when calculating
the aggregate amount of Claims. The aforesaid monetary limitations shall not
apply to any Claims due to breach by Sellers of the Warranties set forth in
Section 7.1 (Ownership of Shares and Authority of Sellers) and Section 7.2
(Existence) or for Claims due to fraud or wilful misconduct by Sellers. 

  

9.2.2 Time Limitations 

    

No Claim shall be brought against Sellers and Sellers shall not be liable in
respect of any Claim unless notice in writing of any such Claim (accompanied
by all relevant particulars thereof specifying the nature of the breach, the
estimated amount claimed in respect thereof and all such other information as
is available to Purchaser as is reasonably necessary to enable Sellers to
assess the merits of the Claim, to act to preserve evidence and to make such
provision as Sellers may consider necessary) has been given to Sellers within
sixty (60) days from the date Purchaser became aware of the circumstances
giving rise to such Claim and in any event not later than twelve (12) months
after the Closing Date, provided that Purchaser shall not be precluded
from making a Claim after such 60-days period prior to the expiration of such
twelve (12) months period in the event and to the extent that Purchasers
failure to notify in such time has not aggravated to any extent the Loss that
is subject to the Claim or made it from an objective perspective commercially
or technically unreasonable to rectify the breach of the Claim. 

   

However, (i) Claims under Section 7.10 (Intellectual Property Rights), Section
7.12 (Environmental matters) and 7.20 (b) (Anti-Bribery Laws) shall be
presented no later than five (5) years following the Closing Date, (ii)
Claims under Section 7.9 (Taxes) shall be presented no later than six (6)
months from the date upon which the applicable statutory limitation periods
expire, and (iii) Claims under Section 7.1 (Ownership of Shares and Authority
of Sellers) and Section 7.2 (Existence) and due to fraud or wilful misconduct
by Sellers may be presented without any time limitations. 

  

9.2.3 Mitigation and Compensation from Third Parties 

    

Purchaser shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate the Losses and Sellers
shall not be liable for any Loss to the extent Purchaser failed to take such
action and such failure has aggravated the Loss. 

   

If Purchaser or any of the Group Companies has a right to indemnification
or compensation relating to a Loss from any third party, the Claim that
Purchaser may make shall be reduced by the amount of such indemnification or
compensation actually received by Purchaser or the Group Companies. Purchaser
shall use all its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue any such
indemnification or compensation opportunity. If such indemnification or
compensation has been received after Sellers have compensated Purchaser,
Purchaser undertakes to refund the amount of such indemnification
or compensation to Sellers. 

   

No liability shall arise in respect of any breach of this Agreement in respect
of any Loss, which is actually recovered under a policy of insurance in force
at Closing. Purchaser shall use all its commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue any such insurance recovery opportunity.  ##### 

 

 

27  

9.2.4 Other limitations 

    

A liability, which is contingent, shall not constitute a Loss recoverable
under this Agreement, unless and until such contingent liability becomes an
actual liability and is due and payable. 

   

If any Loss is a tax deductible item, the Claim that Purchaser may make shall
be reduced by an amount of any actual tax saving resulting from such Loss to
Purchaser or the Group Companies. 

   

Purchaser shall not be entitled to make any Claim to the extent that: 

  

       | (a)  |   | at Closing, Purchaser was aware of the fact,
occurrence or event which constituted a breach of this Agreement resulting
the Loss that is subject to the Claim based on matters fairly disclosed with
reasonable clarity and specificity and in a reasonably discernible way in the
Disclosure Material, the Disclosure Letter and/or the Updated Disclosure
Letter;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | the Claim would not have occurred but for any act,
omission or transaction carried out by Purchaser or its Affiliate;  
      
    | (c)  |   | a provision or allowance for the matter giving rise to
the Loss (whether as a specific reserve or as a general reserve) has been
made in the Audited Annual Accounts or the same is otherwise accounted for or
reflected in the Audited Annual Accounts;  
      
    | (d)  |   | the Claim occurs as a result of the passing of, or
change in, any legislation, regulation or administrative practice of any
governmental or other regulatory body not in force at the date hereof, or
which takes effect retrospectively, including, without prejudice to the
generality of the foregoing, any increase in the rate of tax in force at the
date hereof or any change in the practice of the relevant tax authorities, or
any change after the date hereof of any generally accepted interpretation or
application of any such legislation, regulation or administrative practice;
or  
      
    | (e)  |   | the Claim occurs as a result of any change in
accounting or tax policy or practice of Purchaser or any of the Group
Companies introduced or having effect after Closing.  
   

  

9.3 Joint and Several Liability 

    

Subject to this Section 9.3, Sellers shall be jointly and severally liable for
any breaches of the Warranties up to the Escrow Payment, except for liability
for possible breaches of the Warranty under the first paragraph of Section
7.1 (Ownership of Shares and Authority of Sellers) which shall be several and
not joint. 

   

To the extent Sellers may be held liable for any Claims presented after twelve
(12) months after the Closing Date and/or to the extent Sellers may be held
liable for Claims exceeding the Escrow Payment, the Warrantors shall as of
the date twelve (12) months after the Closing Date onwards be liable for such
possible Claims. The Warrantors liability as of such date for any breaches
of Warranties shall be several and not joint and calculated in proportion to
their holding of Shares. 

   

Sellers liability for breaches of Section 11.2 (Non-Competition) and Section
11.3 (Non-Solicitation) shall be several and not joint. 

  

          ##### 

 

 

28  

     

  

9.4 Third Party Claim 

    

In case Purchaser becomes aware of a third party claim, Purchaser shall: 

  

       | (a)  |   | as soon as reasonably practicable and in any
event within sixty (60) days after the date Purchaser became aware of any
circumstance giving rise to a third party claim, give notice thereof to
Sellers;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | subject to Sellers acknowledging in writing their
indemnification obligation and agreeing to hold Purchaser harmless from and
against the entirety of the Loss relating to such third party claim, not make
any admission of liability, agreement or compromise with any person, body or
authority in relation thereto, without obtaining the prior consent of Sellers
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld);  
      
    | (c)  |   | subject to Sellers acknowledging in writing their
indemnification obligation and agreeing to hold Purchaser harmless from and
against the entirety of the Loss relating to such third party claim, in any
action resist, defend and appeal such claim in the reasonable interest of
Sellers;  
      
    | (d)  |   | give Sellers, or Sellers duly authorised
representatives, reasonable access to the personnel of Purchaser and to any
relevant premises, accounts, documents and records within their respective
power, to enable Sellers, or Sellers duly authorised representatives, to
examine such claim, premises, accounts, documents and records and to take
copies or photocopies thereof;  
      
    | (e)  |   | allow, if requested by Sellers, any negotiation,
dispute or litigation relating to such third party claim to be handled by
Sellers at Sellers costs, provided, however, that should Sellers according
to Purchasers reasonable and well-founded opinion fail or be likely to fail
to properly handle such negotiation, dispute or litigation in the reasonable
interest of Purchaser, Purchaser shall have the right, at its discretion, to
assume control of such action; and  
      
    | (f)  |   | if any of Sellers have made any payment to Purchaser as
a settlement of any claim and Purchaser has the right to recover from any
third party any amount payable as a result of facts or circumstances forming
the basis of such claim, then Purchaser shall on its sole discretion either
assign that right to Sellers or pursue the said recovery at the direction and
reasonable cost of the respective Sellers and pass any monies or property
recovered over to Sellers.  
   

   

Notwithstanding Section 9.4 (a)-(f), with respect to any third party claim for
Taxes: (i) Sellers only have the right to control such claim if it solely
relates to Taxes with respect to any taxable year that has ended or taxable
period related to the time period prior to the Closing Date; (ii) Sellers
shall not consent to any settlement or compromise of such claim without the
written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed; (iii) Sellers or Sellers Representatives, as the case may be,
shall keep Purchaser fully and timely informed with respect to the
commencement, status and nature of any such claim; and (iv) Sellers shall, in
good faith, allow Purchaser to make comments to Sellers or the Sellers
Representative, regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any
such proceeding. 

  

9.5 Indemnity of Sellers 

    

Purchaser hereby agreed to indemnify Sellers against any Loss actually
incurred by Sellers as a direct result of any breach by Purchaser of this
Agreement. The limitations of liability in Section 9.2 above  ##### 

 

 

29   

shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to the obligations of Purchaser under this
Section 9.5 (excluding in respect of any losses resulting from breach of any
payment obligations under this Agreement). 

  

10 Confidentiality 

    

The Parties agree that all confidential information (including trade
secrets, technical, commercial, financial and legal information of the Group
Companies) or other information of a proprietary nature contained in this
Agreement or relating to the Group Companies, including the existence and the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, or obtained by a Party from the other
Parties in connection with the negotiations relating to the transactions
contemplated herein shall be strictly confidential and not be disclosed to
any third party or used to cause damage to another Party. The obligation to
keep information confidential does not apply, if (i) a Party is required to
provide information by law, regulation or governmental decision, or (ii) a
Party is required to provide information by any applicable stock
exchange regulations, or (ii) such disclosure has been consented to by the
other Party, or (iv) the information is commonly known in the public domain
and this is not a result of a breach by the Party. The secrecy obligation set
forth in this Section 10 shall remain in effect for five (5) years from the
Closing Date. 

   

All press releases and other public relations activities of the Parties
with regard to this Agreement shall be mutually approved by Sellers and
Purchaser in advance. 

  

11 Covenants 

   

11.1 Release from Liability of the Directors of the Group Companies 

    

Purchaser undertakes at the next Meeting of Shareholders of each Group Company
to grant discharge to and release of liability to the members of the Board of
each Group Company for their administration until the Closing Date provided
that the auditors of the Group Company do not recommend against such
discharge and release in their report. For the avoidance of doubt it is
understood between the Parties that any such release shall in no way
constitute a release, waiver or otherwise affect the Warranties as given
by Sellers. 

  

11.2 Non-Competition 

    

Each Director, Vacon Plc, Start Fund I Ky, Power Fund I Ky, Power Fund II Ky
and Semikron International GmbH undertake for a period of two (2) years from
the Closing Date not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser,
directly or indirectly engage in any business that would compete with the
business of the Company or a Subsidiary, as conducted in scope and place on
the Closing Date, advising or acting as consultant to any business engaging
in any competing business or otherwise interfere with the business of the
Company or a Subsidiary. Should any of aforementioned Sellers be in breach of
the aforesaid non-competition undertaking, said Seller in breach will pay
a lump-sum as liquidated damages of EUR one hundred thousand (100,000) to
Purchaser, if said Seller is a private individual and EUR one million
(1,000,000), if said Seller is a corporation or a limited partnership. The
right to claim damages, to file a petition for a preliminary injunction and
to take resort to any other remedy or relief shall remain unaffected except
that any such liquidated damages paid shall be set off against any claim for
damages. 

   

The business of Vacon Plc or Semikron International GmbH as conducted as of
the date hereof and described in Appendix 11.2 or investments made by Start
Fund I Ky (and/or any other fund managed by Suomen Teollisuussijoitus Oy) and
Power Fund I Ky/Power Fund II Ky (and/or any other fund managed by VNT
Management Oy) are not considered a breach of the above non-competition
undertaking. The non-competition undertaking shall thus not prevent Start
Fund I Ky (and/or any other  ##### 

 

 

30   

fund managed by Suomen Teollisuussijoitus Oy) and Power Fund I Ky/Power Fund
II Ky (and/or any other fund managed by VNT Management Oy) from making
investments in a company active in the same field of business as the Company.
However, if an investment is made in a company competing directly with the
Company and/or a Group Company, Start Fund I Ky (and/or any other fund
managed by Suomen Teollisuussijoitus Oy), Power Fund I Ky and Power Fund II
Ky (and/or any other fund managed by VNT Management Oy) shall not appoint or
nominate persons having being members of the Board of the Company and/or
a Subsidiary as Board members to such company, in which an investment is
made. 

  

11.3 Non-Solicitation 

    

A Director as well as Vacon Plc, Start Fund I Ky, Power Fund I Ky, Power Fund
II Ky and Semikron International GmbH shall not for the period of eighteen
(18) months following the Closing Date, whether directly or indirectly
through third parties including but not limited to recruitment or search
firms, actively employ, solicit or endeavour to entice away from the Company
or a Subsidiary any person who is or was during a period of six (6) months
immediately preceding the date of this Agreement employed by the Company or a
Subsidiary. The aforesaid shall not prevent a Director or Vacon Plc, Start
Fund I Ky, Power Fund I Ky, Power Fund II Ky or Semikron International GmbH
from employing, directly or indirectly, any person other than a Director
based on the said persons own initiative or application provided that said
Seller has not prior to that actively solicited the said person for
employment. 

  

11.4 Ordinary Course of Business 

    

During the period commencing on the Signing Date and ending on the Closing
Date, Sellers shall cause each Group Company to conduct its activities
diligently in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the
relevant laws and permits, and to use its best efforts to keep intact the
business (including its assets and property) and to preserve its relationship
with personnel, customers, suppliers, distributors, lessors, licensors,
licensees, authorities, creditors, insurance companies and other persons
having a business relationship with such Group Company. 

   

During the period commencing on the Signing Date and ending on the Closing
Date, Sellers shall not take any action, and shall cause the Group Companies
not to take any action, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, that
is outside the ordinary course of business or that may reasonably be deemed
to result in any condition precedent set out in Section 6.3 above not being
satisfied or any Warranty being breached. Without limiting the generality of
the aforesaid, until the Closing, there shall, unless otherwise specifically
contemplated by this Agreement, be no resolutions, actions or events set out
below with respect to the business or any Group Company: 

  

       | (a)  |   | no issue, acquisition, conveyance, redemption,
split, combination or conversion of any shares (including the Shares), option
rights or other specific rights or securities entitling to or convertible
into shares of any Group Company, or increasing or decreasing of the share
capital of any Group Company;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | no distribution of any profits (including but not
limited to dividends except as permitted under this Agreement) or other
assets by any Group Company;  
      
    | (c)  |   | no entering into any agreements or arrangements
regarding borrowing of money or otherwise incurring financial indebtedness
except for the government debt specified in Appendix 7.15, provided, that,
subject to Section 4.1, the Company is entitled to use the credit limits in
force at the Signing Date hereof with Nordea Bank Finland Plc and Svenska
Handelsbanken AB (publ), Branch Operation in Finland;  
       ##### 

 

 

31  

       | (d)  |   | no lending of money to or investing or making
capital contributions in any third party, except in the ordinary course of

ESCROW AGREEMENT 

   

THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Escrow Agreement") is entered into on this []th
day of [], 2011, by and between 

   

     1.  |   | Private persons, corporations and private equity funds
listed in Appendix 1 ("Sellers");  
---|---|--- 
      
  2.  |   | American Superconductor Corporation, a corporation
incorporated and existing under the laws of Delaware, United States, having
its principal place of business at 64 Jackson Road Devens, MA 01434, United
States ("Purchaser"); and  
      
  3.  |   | Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ) Helsinki Branch, a
branch office established and existing under the laws of Finland, having its

Agent").  
   

  

The parties listed under 1-3 above are hereinafter jointly referred to as the
"Parties" and individually as a "Party". 

   

WHEREAS: 

   

     A.  |   | Sellers and Purchaser have entered into a share
purchase agreement (the "Agreement") on 12 March 2011 concerning the sale
and purchase of all of the issued and outstanding shares in The
Switch Engineering Corporation (business identity code 2046716-9), a limited
liability company incorporated under the laws of Finland ("The Switch").  
---|---|--- 
      
  B.  |   | Section 4.2 of the Agreement provides that Purchaser shall at
Closing (i) deposit EUR [] in cash (the "Escrow Payment"); and (ii) deliver
stock certificates representing [] Purchaser Common Stock (the "Escrow
Shares"), i.e. altogether representing EUR nineteen million
(19,000,000) equalling to ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price as defined
in the Agreement, into escrow with the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Payment and
the Escrow Shares are hereinafter jointly referred to as the "Escrow
Property". The allocation of the Escrow Payment and Escrow Shares among
Sellers is set forth in Appendix 2 hereto.  
      
  C.  |   | Sellers, Purchaser and the Escrow Agent shall agree on
specific terms and conditions as regards the administration of the Escrow
Property, including the Escrow Account (as defined below), and the
disbursement thereof.  
   

  

NOW THEREFORE, the Parties enter into this Escrow Agreement and agree as
follows: 

   

1 ** **Definitions 

   

Unless otherwise stated herein the definitions used in the Agreement shall
apply. 

    ##### 

  

     

2 ** **Establishment of the Escrow Account and payment 

   

     (i)  |   | An interest-bearing bank account has been opened and
established with the Escrow Agent in the City of Helsinki under the bank
account number [] in the joint name of Sellers (the "Bank Account") and a
custody account has been opened and established for the Escrow Shares with
the Escrow Agent in the City of Helsinki under the custody account number []
in the joint name of the Directors (the "Custody Account") (the Bank Account
and the Custody Account being hereinafter jointly referred to as the "Escrow
Account"). The terms of the Escrow Account are attached hereto as Appendix
3\. For the avoidance of doubt, Appendix 3 shall be applicable to the Escrow
Account  _provided_ , _however_ , that in case of any conflict between the
terms and conditions of this Escrow Agreement and Appendix 3, the terms and
conditions of this Escrow Agreement shall govern.  
---|---|--- 
      
  (ii)  |   | Neither Sellers nor Purchaser is entitled to use the Escrow
Account for any purposes other than specified in this Escrow Agreement.  
      
  (iii)  |   | The Escrow Property amounts to 10% of the Purchase Price
and equally to 10% of the portions of the Purchase Price payable to each
Seller accordance with Section 4.2 of the Agreement. At Closing, Purchaser
shall pay and transfer the Escrow Payment to the Escrow Account and deliver
the stock certificates representing the Escrow Shares to the Escrow Agent.
The portion of the Escrow Payment and the scrow Shares included in the scrow
Property is divided between Directors and the other Sellers as follows:
Directors 100% of the Escrow Shares and other Sellers 100% of the Escrow
Payment as set forth in Appendix 2 hereto.  
      
  (iv)  |   | Purchaser and Sellers agree that all disbursements made from
the Escrow Account to the Purchaser shall, to the extent available, include
the Escrow Payment and the Escrow Shares. The allocation ratio between the
Escrow Payment and the Escrow Shares shall be []% of the Escrow Payment and
[]% of the Escrow Shares.  
      
  (v)  |   | Sellers and Purchaser agree that, for the purposes of this
Escrow Agreement and for calculating amounts to be released from the Escrow
Property, the minimum value (floor price) of the Escrow Shares is the value
per share calculated and fixed in accordance with Section 4.2 of the
Agreement, which value shall be used when calculating the disbursement of the
Escrow Property to Purchaser. Accordingly and for the avoidance of any doubt,
in case the closing price per share of the Escrow Shares in the Nasdaq Global
Market is on the preceding trading day of the release lower than the value
per share calculated and fixed in accordance with Section 4.2 of the
Agreement, the amount of the Escrow Shares released shall be calculated for
the benefit of the Sellers using the fixed value set out in Section 4.2 of
the Agreement. Purchaser and Sellers further agree that any increase in the
value of the Escrow Shares shall benefit the Directors. Accordingly, in case
the closing price per share of the Escrow Shares in the Nasdaq Global Market
is on the preceding trading day of the release higher than the value per
share calculated and fixed in accordance with Section 4.2 of the Agreement,
Sellers Representative and Purchaser shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay
the surplus directly to the Directors simultaneously when effecting payment
and transfer to the Purchaser.  
   

  

3 ** ** Escrow Agent 

   

The Escrow Account and the Escrow Shares shall be administered on behalf of
Sellers and Purchaser by the Escrow Agent. Purchaser and Sellers hereby
designate and appoint Escrow Agent to serve in accordance with the terms,
conditions and provisions of this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent hereby
agrees to administrate the Escrow Property and arrange for the disbursement of
any portion of the Escrow Property, i.e. funds from the Escrow Account and
the Escrow Shares, pursuant to the joint instructions of Sellers
Representative and Purchaser and in compliance with the terms, conditions and
provisions of this Escrow Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

4 Interest, dividends, increase of value of the Escrow Shares and taxes 

   

     (i)  |   | Sellers and Purchaser agree that all interest,
dividends and other income, if any, attributable to the Escrow Property shall

---|---|--- 
      
  (ii)  |   | Sellers and Purchaser agree that for tax purposes, all
taxable interest, dividends and other income, if any, attributable to the

  (iii)  |   | The Escrow Agent shall report to Sellers Representative,
as of each calendar year-end, all income, if any, attributable to the Escrow
Property or any other amount held in escrow by the Escrow Agent pursuant to

as the owners of the Escrow Shares for all tax purposes (except to the extent
that any such Escrow Shares are disbursed to Purchaser pursuant to Section
5), and none of the parties shall take any actions or positions that
are inconsistent with such treatment.  
   

  

5 Disbursement of the Escrow Property 

   

     (i)  |   | The Escrow Property or any portion thereof shall and
may be released by the Escrow Agent only as follows:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | If Sellers Representative and Purchaser deliver
to the Escrow Agent a joint written direction signed by both Sellers
Representative and Purchaser directing the Escrow Agent to arrange for
the disbursement of any portion of the Escrow Property specified in such
direction to Sellers and/or Purchaser, as the case may be, in accordance with
designated delivery instructions; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | If Purchaser or Sellers Representative delivers to the
Escrow Agent a written direction together with a true copy of an arbitral
award or judgment in respect of a claim or dispute under the Agreement,
whereupon the Escrow Agent shall arrange for the disbursement to which
Purchaser or Sellers are entitled according to such arbitral award or
judgment in accordance with designated delivery instructions received from
Purchaser or the Sellers Representative, as the case may be.  
   

  

     (ii)  |   | Purchaser and Sellers Representative shall, thirty
(30) days from the Release Date, jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
immediately release to Sellers in accordance with designated
delivery instructions the Escrow Property, less any amount at dispute. If no
claim under the Agreement has been made by Purchaser on the Release Date, at
the latest, and Purchaser has confirmed this in writing to the Escrow Agent,
Purchaser and Sellers Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent
to immediately release to Sellers in accordance with designated delivery
instructions the Escrow Property.  
---|---|--- 
      
  (iii)  |   | A partial disbursement of the Escrow Property shall be
allocated among Sellers pro rata to their shareholding in The Switch as set
out in the Agreement and Appendix 1 and equally taking into account the
division between the Escrow Payment and the Escrow Shares. Whenever a partial
release of the Escrow Shares is anticipated, Purchaser shall, upon request by
the Escrow Agent and after the Escrow Agent has been directed in writing with
the amounts, to promptly reissue the stock certificates of the Escrow Shares
in the number of certificates necessary so as to enable such partial
release.  
      
  (iv)  |   | After the release of any part of the Escrow Shares to
Purchaser pursuant to Sections 5(i)(a) or 5(i)(b) above, it is at Purchasers
sole discretion whether such Escrow Shares will be held as Purchasers
treasury shares or sold to a third party.  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     (v)  |   | Any Escrow Shares released by the Escrow Agent to the
Directors pursuant to this Escrow Agreement shall reduce the restricted
Purchaser Common Stock in pro rata over the three years lock-up period agreed
in the Stockholders Agreement  
---|---|--- 
   

  

6 Fees and Expenses

7 Responsibility of the Escrow Agent 

   

The acceptance by the Escrow Agent of its duties under this Escrow Agreement
is subject to the following terms and conditions, and the Parties to this
Escrow Agreement hereby agree that such terms and conditions shall govern and
control such Escrow Agents rights, duties, liabilities and immunities: 

   

     (i)  |   | The Escrow Agent shall act hereunder as depository
only, and it shall not be responsible or liable in any manner whatsoever for
the sufficiency of any amount deposited with it. The duties
and responsibilities of the Escrow Agent hereunder shall be determined solely
by the express provisions of this Escrow Agreement and the laws and
regulations related to the conduct of banking business generally applicable
to it, and no further duties or responsibilities shall be implied. The
Escrow Agent shall not have any liability under, nor duty to inquire into,
the terms and provisions of any agreements or instructions, other than
outlined in this Escrow Agreement, for the avoidance of doubt excluding the
Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
      
  (ii)  |   | The Escrow Agent shall be protected in acting upon any
written notice, request, waiver, consent, receipt or other paper or document
furnished to it in accordance with this Escrow Agreement by Sellers
Representative and/or Purchaser, as the case shall be, not only as to its
due execution and the validity and effectiveness of its provisions but also
as to the truth and acceptability of any information therein contained, which
it, in good faith, believes to be genuine and what it purports to be. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for any direct
or indirect damage, cost, expense or loss arising out from its actions based
on the receipt of the document as set forth above.  
      
  (iii)  |   | The Escrow Agent shall not be bound by any waiver,
modification, amendment, termination or rescission of this Escrow Agreement,
unless received by it in writing and signed by both Sellers Representative
and Purchaser.  
      
  (iv)  |   | The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for any direct or
indirect damage, cost, expense or loss arising out from the fact that the
Escrow Agent has been prevented from releasing the Escrow Property due to a
force majeure event (including but not limited to strike, industrial
action, order of a competent authority or other corresponding event).  
      
  (v)  |   | The Escrow Agent shall not have the right to use the Escrow
Property (or part thereof), including the account in which the Escrow Payment
is deposited, to set-off any receivable it has or may have in the future from
Sellers or Purchaser, excluding the fees pursuant to Section 6 above.  
      
  (vi)  |   | The Escrow Agent undertakes to distinguish the Escrow
Account from the other accounts and the Escrow Shares from the other shares
administered by the Escrow Agent and to keep the funds on the Escrow Account
and the Escrow Shares segregated from the Escrow Agents own property and
funds, as well as the property and funds of any other customers or third
parties. The Escrow Agent shall deal with neither the funds deposited on the
Escrow Account nor  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   | the Escrow Shares in a way other than expressly permitted
by this Escrow Agreement and shall carry out only those payment instructions
that are described in this Escrow Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

8 Amendment and Termination 

   

This Escrow Agreement may be amended or terminated by and upon written notice
to the Escrow Agent at any time given jointly by Purchaser and Sellers
Representative provided that the rights, duties or responsibilities of the
Escrow Agent may not be amended or modified without its consent. This Escrow
Agreement shall terminate without further notice when the entire Escrow
Property has been properly disbursed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with
the terms of this Escrow Agreement. 

   

9 Pledge 

   

     (i)  |   | Sellers shall, as continuing security for the proper
fulfillment by Sellers of all of their obligations under and for any
potential claims Purchaser may have against Sellers based on the Agreement or
the Stockholders Agreement, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably pledge
to Purchaser, as first priority security, all its rights in the Escrow
Payment, including the account in which it is deposited, and the Escrow
Shares.  
---|---|--- 
      
  (ii)  |   | The pledge created hereunder and all obligations of Sellers
in relation thereto shall continue in full force from the date hereof until
all of the Escrow Property shall have been disbursed to Purchaser or released
to Sellers. In case of partial release of the Escrow Property to Sellers,
the pledge shall automatically cease to exist in relation to such Escrow
Property released to Sellers.  
      
  (iii)  |   | The Escrow Agent hereby confirms that (i) it is aware of
the pledge created hereunder, (ii) it will comply with the generally
applicable rules on the pledge of receivables under Finnish law, and (iii)
prior to the execution hereof, it has not been notified of any pledge or other
security interest over the Escrow Payment, the Escrow Account or the Escrow
Shares.  
   

  

10 Indemnification of the Escrow Agent 

   

Purchaser and Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Escrow Agent and its officers, directors, employees,
representatives and agents, from and against and reimburse the Escrow Agent
for any and all claims, expenses, obligations, liabilities, losses, damages,
injuries (to person, property, or natural resources), penalties, stamp or
other similar taxes, actions, suits, judgments, reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) of whatever kind or
nature regardless of their merit, demanded, asserted or claimed against the
Escrow Agent directly or indirectly relating to, or arising from,
claims against the Escrow Agent by reason of its participation in the
transactions contemplated hereby, including without limitation all reasonable
costs required to be associated with claims for damages to persons or
property, and reasonable attorneys and consultants fees and expenses and

survive the termination of this Agreement or the earlier resignation or
removal of the Escrow Agent.

Stockholders, such Common Stock pro rata into the market upon receiving

Common Stock on any trading day, (ii) all sales on a single trading day are

 (a) _SEC Reports; Disclosure Materials; Rule 144(i)_.

contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein (in the case of any prospectus, prospectus supplement or
Free Writing Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made) not misleading. Each of the consolidated financial statements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries contained in the SEC Reports, together with
related schedules and notes, presents fairly in all material respects the

At the time of the filing of the Shelf Form S-3, the Company qualified as a WKSI. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts so that, as of the Closing Date, (i) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Shelf Form S-3 has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose has been initiated; (ii) the Shelf Form S-3 complies in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading and (iii) at the time of the most recent amendment to the Shelf Form S-3 for the purpose of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act, if any, the Company qualified as a WKSI.

 _REGISTRATION OF THE REGISTRABLE SECURITIES; OTHER MATTERS_  

  

 Section 5.1 _Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus Supplement._  

  

 (a) Not later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, each of the Other Stockholders shall furnish to the Company a completed Selling Securityholder Questionnaire, the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Selling Securityholder Questionnaire"), containing the information required for use in the preparation of the Prospectus Supplement (as defined below), provided that, for the purpose of this Section 5.1(a), an Other 

   ##### 

  

   

Stockholder shall be deemed to have provided the number of Registrable
Securities owned by such Other Stockholder on a timely basis if the Sellers
Representatives, on behalf of such Other Stockholder, provide
such information to the Company not later than one (1) Business Day prior to
the Closing Date. The Company shall prepare a Prospectus Supplement, pursuant
to Rule 424 under the Securities Act to the Shelf Form S-3 (together with the
accompanying base prospectus, the "Prospectus Supplement") reflecting, among
other things, the information contained in the Selling
Securityholder Questionnaires provided to the Company by the Other
Stockholders at least ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date. If during
the Shelf Registration Period any event with respect to either an Other
Stockholder or any Affiliate of an Other Stockholder shall occur which is
required at that time to be described in the Prospectus Supplement and is not
already so described therein, such Other Stockholder shall promptly notify
the Company. Not later than two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date, (i)
the Company shall file with the SEC the Prospectus Supplement to cover
the registration of the Registrable Securities for resale by the Other
Stockholders that have furnished to the Company the Selling Securityholder
Questionnaire not later than ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date; and
(ii) the Company shall cause its counsel to issue a blanket opinion
(the "Blanket Opinion") to the Companys transfer agent stating that the
Registrable Securities covered by the Prospectus Supplement are subject to an
effective registration statement and, when transferred in a transaction
covered by the Prospectus Supplement, can be issued free of any restrictive
legend(s), subject to customary qualifications. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement
continuously effective under the Securities Act until the earlier of (i) when
each Other Stockholder is able to sell all of their Registrable Securities
without volume and manner of sale restrictions under Rule 144, and (ii)
when each Other Stockholder has sold all of its Registrable Securities
pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement (the "Shelf Registration
Period"); provided, however, that the Company shall have the right to suspend
the use of the Shelf Registration Statement for not more than forty-five (45)
Business Days in the aggregate during any 12-month period (a "Suspension
Period") if (x) the Company is engaged in an material activity or transaction
or preparations for a material activity or transaction that the Company
desires to keep confidential for business reasons and the Company determines
in good faith that the disclosure of such activity, transaction or
preparations would otherwise be required by disclosure requirements under the
Securities Act, and (y) the Company provides the Other Stockholders with
written notice of such suspension (a "Suspension Notice"). The Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to lift any such suspension as
promptly as practicable after the condition specified in clause (x) above is
no longer applicable. The Stockholders agree to treat and keep the existence
of any such suspension confidential. If the Company suspends the use of the
Shelf Registration Statement, the Other Stockholders shall immediately cease
Transfers of shares pursuant thereto upon the receipt of the Suspension
Notice. The Company shall promptly notify the Other Stockholders when the
Shelf Registration Statement may once again be used. Prior to the expiration
of the Shelf Registration Period, each Other Stockholder shall notify the
Company of each Transfer of Registrable Securities within ten Business Days
of such Transfer. 

   

 (b) The Company shall, other than during a Suspension Period, (i) as promptly as practicable, prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-effective amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement, or such replacement registration statements in 

   ##### 

  

   

compliance with Rule 415(a)(6), as may be necessary to keep the Shelf
Registration Statement continuously effective and available for the resale of
the Registrable Securities by the Other Stockholders during the
Shelf Registration Period; (ii) cause the related prospectus to be
supplemented by any required prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to
be filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act; and
(iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act applicable to the disposition of Registrable
Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement during the Shelf
Registration Period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by
the Other Stockholders set forth in such Shelf Registration Statement as
so amended or such prospectus as so supplemented. 

   

 (c) If in connection with the filing of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K prior to and during the Shelf Registration Period, the Company does not qualify as a WKSI, then the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make such filings as are necessary to maintain an effective Shelf Registration Statement related to the resale of the Registrable Securities. If a new non-automatic shelf registration statement is filed, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the new Shelf Registration Statement to become effective as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the new Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective during the Shelf Registration Period. 

   

 (d) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal, at the earliest possible time, of an order suspending the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, if applicable. 

   

 (e) The Other Stockholders acknowledge that the Company is required to maintain the accuracy of the information included in the Shelf Registration Statement, including information contained in the Prospectus Supplement. To the extent required to comply with the Securities Act, the Other Stockholders shall promptly furnish to the Company any additional information required to correct and update any previously furnished information or required so that the Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus Supplement shall not contain, with respect to such Other Stockholder, an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a fact necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any prospectus, prospectus supplement or Free Writing Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading. 

   

 Section 5.2 _Registration Procedures._  

  

 (a) In connection with the Companys obligations with respect to the registration of the Registrable Securities, the Company shall during the Shelf Registration Period: 

   

 (i) promptly notify the Other Stockholders and confirm such advice in writing, (A) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceedings for that purpose, or (B) that the Shelf Registration Statement or prospectus or prospectus supplement or any document incorporated by reference therein contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements 

   ##### 

  

 

therein (in the case of the Prospectus Supplement, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading; and 

   

 (ii) unless available on EDGAR, deliver to the Other Stockholders as many copies of the prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities and any amendment or supplement thereto in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act, as such Other Stockholders may reasonably request, to permit such Other Stockholders to satisfy the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act. 

  

 (b) In the event that the Company would be required, pursuant to Section 5.2(a)(i)(B), to notify the Other Stockholders, the Company shall prepare and furnish to the Other Stockholders a reasonable number of copies of a prospectus supplemented or amended so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the Registrable Securities, such prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any prospectus, prospectus supplement or Free Writing Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading. The Other Stockholders agree that upon receipt of any notice from the Company pursuant to Section 5.2(a)(i)(B), they shall forthwith discontinue the disposition of the Registrable Securities until they shall have received copies of such amended or supplemented prospectus, and if so directed by the Company, the Other Stockholders shall deliver to the Company all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in their possession of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such notice. 

   

 (c) The Company may require the Other Stockholders to furnish to the Company such information regarding the Other Stockholders and their intended method of distribution of the Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing, but only to the extent that such information is required in order to comply with the Securities Act;  _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to amend or supplement the Shelf Registration Statement to permit the resale by the Other Stockholders of Registrable Securities in an underwritten offering. Each Other Stockholder agrees to notify the Company as promptly as practicable of any inaccuracy or change in information previously furnished by such Other Stockholder to the Company or of the occurrence of any event, in either case as a result of which any prospectus relating to such registration contains or would contain an untrue statement of a material fact regarding such Other Stockholder or such Other Stockholders intended method of distribution of such Registrable Securities or omits or would omit to state any material fact regarding such Other Stockholder or such Other Stockholders intended method of distribution of such Registrable Securities required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any prospectus, prospectus supplement or Free Writing Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and promptly to furnish to the Company any additional information required to correct and update any previously furnished information or required so that such prospectus shall not contain, with respect to such Other Stockholder or the distribution of such Registrable Securities, an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any prospectus, prospectus supplement or Free Writing Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading.

 (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Other Stockholder holding Registrable Securities, the Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, members, managers and agents of each such Other Stockholder and each Person who controls any such Other Stockholder within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (or actions in respect thereof), including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses, reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim, to which they or any of them may become subject insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any violation of the Securities Act, Exchange Act or state securities Laws, or upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a registration statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or the Disclosure Package, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the Disclosure Package, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense arises (i) out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any such Other Stockholder specifically for inclusion therein including, without limitation, any notice and questionnaire, (ii) out of sales of Common Stock made during a Suspension Period or (iii) to the extent that a prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities was required to be delivered by the Other Stockholder under the Securities Act, out of or is caused by such Other Stockholders failure to deliver a copy of any preliminary, final or summary prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus, or any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of Registrable Securities and if the prospectus or the Free Writing Prospectus, or any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, and after the Company has furnished such Indemnified Party with a sufficient number of copies of the same. 

   

 (b) Each Other Stockholder severally (and not jointly) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each of its Affiliates, directors, employees, members, managers and agents and each Person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they or any of them may become subject insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of or are based upon any violation of the Securities Act, Exchange Act or state securities Laws, upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a registration statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Disclosure Package, or any Other Stockholder Free Writing Prospectus, preliminary, final or summary prospectus included in any such registration statement, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or 

   ##### 

  

   

alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the
Disclosure Package, or any preliminary, final or summary prospectus or Free
Writing Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made) not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
was made in reliance on and in conformity with any written information
relating to such Other Stockholder furnished to the Company by or on behalf
of such Other Stockholder specifically for inclusion therein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the total amount to be indemnified by such Other Stockholder
pursuant to this Section 5.3(b) shall be limited to the net proceeds (after
deducting underwriters discounts and commissions, if any) received by such
Other Stockholder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities to which
such registration statement or prospectus relates. 

   

 (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 5.3 of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including governmental investigation), such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 5.3, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from liability under Section 5.3(a) or Section 5.3(b) unless and to the extent such action and such failure results in material prejudice to the indemnifying party. If any such claim, action or proceeding shall be brought against the indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, except as provided in the next sentence, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election to so assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. Notwithstanding the indemnifying partys rights in the prior sentence, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ its own counsel (and one local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel satisfactory to the indemnifying party if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would, in the reasonable judgment of the indemnified party, present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, based on advice of counsel to the indemnified party, shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after written notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall, in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general circumstances or allegations, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties. An indemnifying party shall not be liable under this Section 5.3 to any indemnified party regarding 

   ##### 

  

   

any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in
respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder
(whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties
to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent is
consented to by such indemnifying party in writing. No indemnifying party, in
the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the written
consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement or compromise unless such settlement or compromise
(x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all
liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y)
does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability
or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. 

   

 (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in Section 5.3(a) or Section 5.3(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party agrees to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which such indemnifying party may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Other Stockholders on the other hand from the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and this Agreement. If, however, this allocation is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Other Stockholders on the other hand from the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party on the one hand or the indemnified party on the other and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5.3(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Other Stockholders or any agents or underwriters or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 5.3(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 5.3(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5.3(d), no Other Stockholder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the net proceeds (after deducting underwriters discounts and commissions, if any) received by such Other Stockholder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5.3(d), no Person guilty of fraudulent 

   ##### 

  

   

misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. 

   

 (e) The agreements contained in this Section 5.3 shall survive the sale of the Registrable Securities by the Other Stockholders and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement after the Closing. 

   

 Section 5.4 _Other Matters._  

  

 (a) The Company covenants that for so long as the Company is otherwise required to maintain the registration of the Common Stock under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to timely file (or obtain extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed by the Company after the Closing pursuant to the Exchange Act and to submit electronically and post on its corporate Web site every Interactive Data File required to be submitted and posted pursuant to Rule 405 of Regulation S-T. If the Company is not then required to file reports pursuant to the Exchange Act, it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and furnish to the Stockholders and make publicly available in accordance with Rule 144(c) such information as is required for the Stockholders to sell the Common Stock under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act. The Company further covenants that it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such further action as any Stockholder may reasonably request, to the extent required from time to time to enable the Stockholders to sell such Common Stock without registration under the Securities Act within the requirements of the exemption provided by Rule 144. 

   

 (b) Upon the calculation of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to the Other Stockholders in accordance with Section 4.2(a) of the Purchase Agreement, the Company and the Sellers Representatives shall complete Schedule I attached hereto by listing the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to each Other Stockholder at the Closing opposite such Other Stockholders name on Schedule I attached hereto.
