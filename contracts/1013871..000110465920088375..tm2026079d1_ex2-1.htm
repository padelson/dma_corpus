(as revised in accordance with this sentence) shall become final and binding upon the parties hereto on the earlier of (a) the
date Parent and Purchaser resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement
and (b)&nbsp;the date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 3.04
and Section 3.06(c). Any item in the Closing Adjustment Statement that is not disputed in a Notice of Disagreement shall be final
and binding on the parties hereto. During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Parent and Purchaser
shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 30-day period, Parent and Purchaser shall submit to the Accounting Firm for expert determination
any and all matters that remain in dispute and were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement. The Accounting Firm shall
act as an expert, and not as an arbitrator. The &ldquo;<U>Accounting Firm</U>&rdquo; shall be an internationally recognized independent
public accounting firm as shall be reasonably agreed upon by the parties hereto in writing. Parent and Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a decision in writing resolving the matters submitted to the Accounting
Firm within 30 days of receipt of the submission. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be made in accordance with this
Section 3.04 and Section 3.06(c) and shall be final and binding on the parties hereto, absent fraud or manifest error, and judgment
may be entered upon such determination in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
enforced. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 3.04 shall be borne by Purchaser and Parent in
inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocations shall also be
calculated by the Accounting Firm at the time the determination of the Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of the matters
submitted. Other than the fees and expenses referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, the fees and expenses of Parent
incurred in connection with this Section 3.04 (including with respect to accountants and attorneys) shall be borne by Parent and
the fees and expenses of Purchaser incurred in connection with this Section 3.04 (including with respect to accountants and attorneys)
shall be borne by Purchaser.</P>

to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend to Purchaser the amounts set forth therein for purposes of funding the Transactions
and satisfying ongoing Credit Support Obligations of the Transferred Group Members (the &ldquo;<U>Debt Financing</U>&rdquo;). Purchaser
has also delivered to Parent true and complete copies of any fee letters related to the Debt Commitment Letter (which such fee
letters may be redacted in a customary manner solely to remove fee amounts, pricing caps, market flex provisions and other economic
terms set forth therein, none of which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability
or aggregate amount of the Debt Financing). Each of the Debt Commitment Letter and any such fee letter, in the form so delivered,
is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, each
of the other parties thereto, enforceable against such parties in accordance with its terms (except insofar as such enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors&rsquo; rights
generally, or by principles governing the availability of equitable remedies). As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment
Letter and the related fee letters have not been amended, supplemented or otherwise modified in any respect (provided that the
existence or exercise of &ldquo;market flex&rdquo; provisions contained in any fee letter shall not constitute an amendment, supplement
or modification of the Debt Commitment Letter), no amendment, supplement or modification is contemplated (except for any amendment,
supplement or modification solely to join additional lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
as parties thereto, in each case where such amendment, supplement or modification would not reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability or aggregate amount of the Debt Financing), and the financing commitments
thereunder have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Purchaser or, to the Knowledge
of Purchaser, any other parties thereto under any term or condition of the Debt Commitment Letter or the related fee letters, and,
assuming the satisfaction (or waiver) of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article IX and the performance in all material
respects by Parent of its obligations under Section 8.10, Purchaser has no reason to believe that any condition precedent to the
funding of any of the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter will not be satisfied on a timely basis, or that any
portion of the Debt Financing to be made thereunder will otherwise not be available to Purchaser on a timely basis to consummate
the Transactions at the time required pursuant to this Agreement.</P>

available to Purchaser pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and the related fee letters are not subject to any conditions

(a) <U>Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Third Party Claims</U>. If any party hereto (the &ldquo;<U>Indemnified Party</U>&rdquo;)
receives written notice of the commencement of any Action or the assertion of any claim by a third party or the imposition of any
penalty or assessment for which indemnity may be sought under Section&nbsp;11.03 or 11.04 (a &ldquo;<U>Third Party Claim</U>&rdquo;),
and such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article&nbsp;XI, the Indemnified Party shall promptly provide
the other party (the&nbsp;&ldquo;<U>Indemnifying Party</U>&rdquo;) with written notice of such Third Party Claim, stating the nature,
basis and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the relevant documents evidencing such Third Party Claim
and the basis for indemnification sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying
Party from liability on account of this indemnification, except if and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the
defense of the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party. So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance herewith,
(i)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party shall actively pursue such defense in good faith, (ii) the Indemnified Party may retain separate
co-counsel at its sole cost and expense (except as contemplated by the following sentence) and participate in the defense of the
Third Party Claim, (iii)&nbsp;the Indemnified Party shall not file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party and (iv)&nbsp;the
Indemnifying Party shall not (A)&nbsp;admit to any wrongdoing or (B)&nbsp;consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim to the extent such judgment or settlement (x) provides for (1)&nbsp;relief other
than money damages, (2)&nbsp;money damages if the Indemnifying Party has not acknowledged in writing that it shall be responsible
for such money damages or (3) any admission of wrongdoing or (y) fails to provide for the unconditional release of the Indemnified
Party, in the case each of clauses (A) and (B), without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event that the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party reasonably
agree that a conflict of interest exists in respect of a Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
retain separate counsel selected by the Indemnified Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party to represent the
Indemnified Party in the defense of the Third Party Claim, and the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party
shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume
the defense of any Third Party Claim if the Third Party Claim (w) seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief
other than monetary damages against the Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after conferring with
its outside counsel, cannot be separated from any related claim for monetary damages, (x) involves criminal allegations, (y) involves
a claim which, if adversely determined, would be reasonably expected, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, to establish
a precedent, custom or practice materially adverse to the continuing business interests or prospects of the Indemnified Party or
(z) involves a claim that, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to
vigorously defend after reasonable notice and opportunity to cure. Each party hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize Losses from Third Party Claims and shall act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise
dealing with such claims. The parties hereto shall also cooperate in any such defense and give each other reasonable access to
all information relevant thereto. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense, such Indemnifying Party shall
not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment that was consented
to by the Indemnified Party without the Indemnifying Party&rsquo;s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).</P>

a Third Party Claim giving rise to the claim of indemnity pursuant hereto. The failure so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall

Party is materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from receipt of any such notice to give notice
of dispute of the claim to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying
Party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters.
Such assistance and cooperation shall include providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and documents relating
to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal
and business assistance with respect to such matters.</P>
