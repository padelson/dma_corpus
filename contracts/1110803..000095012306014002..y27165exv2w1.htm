All Company Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Company Shares (" _Company Certificate_ ") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be issued in consideration therefor, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with this Article III, and any dividends or other distributions to which holders of Company Shares become entitled in accordance with this Article III upon the surrender of such Company Certificate. 

  

 (d) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there is a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, extraordinary cash dividend, combination or exchange of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect of, Company Shares or Parent Shares, the Exchange Ratio and Merger Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly, without duplication, to provide to the holders of Company Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 (a) Prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the record holders of Company Shares, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for payment of the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent (i) certificates representing the total number of Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger and (ii) any cash payable in lieu of fractional Parent Shares pursuant to Section 3.2(e).

   ##### 

  

    

thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor certificates representing that number of whole
Parent Shares, if any, into which the number of Company Shares previously
represented by such Company Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to
Section 3.1 and any cash, distributions or dividends required to be paid
pursuant to Sections 3.2(d) and (e) below, and Company Certificates so
surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The Exchange Agent shall promptly
accept such Company Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices. No interest shall
accrue on the Merger Consideration (or the cash payable as described in
Sections 3.2(d) and (e) below) payable upon the surrender of
Company Certificates for the benefit of, or be paid to, the holders of
Company Certificates. 

  

 (d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Certificate with respect to the Parent Shares represented thereby by reason of the conversion of Company Shares pursuant to Section 3.1, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional Parent Shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 3.2(e) until such Company Certificate is surrendered in accordance with this Article III. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Company Certificate, there shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the Parent Shares representing such securities are registered (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional Parent Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(e) and the proportionate amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to Parent Shares issued upon conversion of Company Shares, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the proportionate amount of dividends or other distributions, with (x) a record date with respect thereto after the Effective Time, but prior to such surrender, and (y) a payment date subsequent to such surrender, payable with respect to such Parent Shares. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no fraction of a Parent Share will be issued and no dividend or other distribution, stock split or interest with respect to Parent Shares shall relate to any fractional Parent Share, and such fractional interest shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a security holder of the Parent Shares. In lieu of any such fractional security, each holder of shares of Company Shares otherwise entitled to a fraction of a Parent Share in accordance with the provisions of this Article III will be entitled to receive from the Exchange Agent a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a Parent Share multiplied by (ii) the 20-Day Parent VWAP Price. 

  

 (f) All Merger Consideration delivered upon the surrender of Company Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to Company Shares theretofore represented by such Company Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Company Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration into

If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article III. 

  

 (h) If any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond or other surety in such amount as the Exchange Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made with respect to such Company Certificate and subject to such other reasonable conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such Company Certificate the Merger Consideration into which Company Shares theretofore represented by such Company Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this Article III. 

  

 (i) If any payment under this Article III is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any Company Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Company Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of Company Certificate surrendered or such Person shall establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

  

 (j) The Exchange Agent shall invest any funds held by it for purposes of this Section 3.2 as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. 

  

 (k) Parent and/or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration or other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (in whatever form) to the holders of Company Shares an amount equal to the amounts, if any, required to be deducted or withheld under any provision of U.S. federal Tax Law, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. Amounts so withheld shall promptly be paid to the appropriate Tax authority and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of Company Shares in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. 

  

 (l) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Parent Shares (or dividends or distributions 

   ##### 

  

    

with respect thereto) or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any Parent Shares or
portion of the cash that has been made available to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to this Section 3.2 that remains unclaimed by the holder of any
Company Certificate six (6) months after the Effective Time, shall be returned
to Parent and any such holder who has not exchanged such holders Company
Certificate prior to such time shall thereafter look only to Parent for any
claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Shares to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(e) and
any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares to which
they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(d) hereunder. 

  

 Section 3.3 _Company Stock Options/Warrants_. 

  

 (a) _Company Stock Options_. Each Company Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, cease to represent a right to acquire Company Shares and shall automatically be converted into an option (a " _Company Converted Option_ ") to purchase Parent Shares. The number of Parent Shares subject to each Company Converted Option shall be equal to the product of the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that any fractional Parent Shares resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. The exercise price per share of each Company Converted Option shall equal the quotient of the exercise price per share under the corresponding Company Option divided by the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each such Company Converted Option will otherwise have substantially the same terms and conditions as the corresponding Company Option, including vesting and term of exercise. The Company agrees to take all actions necessary, if any, to effectuate the provisions of this Section 3.3. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the conversion of options under this Section 3.3 shall be made in a manner so as to preserve as nearly as possible any exemption from Section 409A a Company Option may have and/or any status as an "incentive stock option" a Company Option may have immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) _Company Warrants_. Each warrant to purchase Company Shares (a " _Company Warrant_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, cease to represent a right to acquire Company Shares and shall automatically be converted into a warrant (a " _Company Converted Warrant_ ") to purchase Parent Shares. The number of Parent Shares subject to each Company Converted Warrant shall be equal to the product of the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Warrant multiplied by the Exchange Ratio;  _provided_ that any fractional Parent Shares resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. The purchase price per share of each Company Converted Warrant shall equal the quotient of the purchase price per share under the corresponding Company Warrant divided by the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that such purchase price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each such Company Converted Warrant will otherwise have substantially the same terms and conditions as the corresponding Company Warrant, including the term of exercise.

 (a) For a period of at least one (1) year following the Effective Time (such period of time, the " _Protected Period_ "), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates to provide to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries with benefits which are comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. Notwithstanding anything set forth above, the participation of the employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries in any Parents option or similar equity grant or purchase programs or plans shall be subject to the eligibility requirements of such programs or plans. 

  

 (b) Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing shall be provided credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such employees, under: (i) all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and fringe benefits to be provided to such employees for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual); (ii) severance plans, programs and policies to be provided to such employees for purposes of calculating the amount of each such employees severance benefits; and (iii) vacation and sick leave plans, programs and policies for purposes of calculating the amount of each such employees vacation and sick leave.

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.13 shall impede or limit Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their Affiliates from terminating any of their employees at any time for any reason or no reason, subject to the provisions of applicable Law and applicable Contracts. 

  

 (d) As promptly as practicable but no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 covering the sale of Parent Stock issuable pursuant to outstanding Company Options assumed by Parent pursuant to the terms hereof, and Parent shall use reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement so long as any assumed Company Options remain outstanding. The Company will cooperate and reasonably assist Parent in the preparation of such registration statement. 

  

 (e) No provision of this Section 6.13 shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Company Employee, any beneficiary or dependent thereof with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any Company Employee by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries under any benefit plan which they may maintain.

 (b) Except as otherwise directed by Parent in writing at least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, all contracts, agreements, arrangements, or intercompany account systems under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may at any time have an obligation to indemnify for or share the payment of or liability for any portion of a Tax or any amount calculated with reference to any portion of a Tax (other than customary agreements to indemnify lessors, licensors, lenders and debt securityholders in respect of Taxes none of which involves any material financial exposure) shall be terminated with respect to the Company and each such Subsidiary on or prior to the 

   ##### 

  

    

Closing Date, and the Company and each such Subsidiary shall thereafter be
released from any liability thereunder. 

  

 (c) Without the written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, do any of the following: (i) make, change or revoke any election in respect of Taxes, (ii) file any amended Tax Return, (iii) adopt or change any accounting method or period in respect of Taxes, (iv) enter into any closing agreement, (v) settle any claim or assessment in respect of Taxes, (vi) change any practice with respect to Taxes, (vii) consent to any extension or waiver of any statute of limitations applicable to any claim or assessment in respect of Taxes or (viii) offer or agree to do any of the foregoing or surrender its rights to do any of the foregoing or to claim any refund in respect of Taxes. 

  

 (d) Parent and Company intend that the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that it will not take (and will cause its Subsidiaries not to take) any action, or fail to take (or allow any Subsidiary to fail to take) any action, which action or failure to take action would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger not to so qualify. Each of Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain the Tax opinions referred to in Section 7.2(i) and Section 7.3(e), respectively. 

  

 Section 6.15 _Parent Board of Directors_. Effective as of the Effective Time, the size of the Board of Directors of Parent shall be increased from eight (8) to ten (10) members and two (2) individuals selected by the Board of Directors of Parent and agreed to by the Company, consistent with the policies of Parents corporate governance committee, shall be appointed as independent directors of Parent.
