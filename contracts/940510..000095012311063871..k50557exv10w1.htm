PURCHASE PRICE AND PAYMENT

The aggregate consideration to be paid by the Buyer or by the Agent pursuant to the applicable Agency Agreement for the sale of the Assets and for the right of the Agent to conduct the GOB Sales pursuant to the terms of the Agency Agreement shall consist of (a) $215,100,000 (the " _Initial Purchase Price_ "), subject to adjustment in accordance with Sections 2.2 and 2.3, and (b) the assumption by the Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities. At the Closing, $17,000,000 of the Initial Purchase Price (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") shall be delivered by the Buyer to the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with instructions given by the Escrow Agent. The balance of the Initial Purchase Price, as adjusted in accordance with Section 2.2, shall be paid to the Sellers at the Closing by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with instructions given by the Sellers to the Buyer. 

  

 2.2 _Adjustments to the Initial Purchase Price_. 

  

 (a) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the Sellers calculation of the Net Working Capital as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Net Working Capital_ "). The Sellers calculation of the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital shall be made on an estimated basis using the same accounting methodologies and procedures used to calculate the Reference Closing Net Working Capital as set forth on _Schedule 2.2(a)_. An appropriate dollar-for-dollar adjustment shall be made in the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital to take into account any Pre-Closing GOB Sales. 

  

 (b) If the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Reference Closing Net Working Capital, the Initial Purchase Price shall be decreased dollar-for-dollar by the absolute value of the deficiency. If the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the Reference Closing Net Working Capital, the Initial Purchase Price shall be increased dollar-for-dollar by the absolute value of the excess. 

  

 (c) Within fifteen (15) days after the first full monthly accounting period (or four or five weeks, as the case may be) following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers written notice (the " _Adjustment Notice_ ") containing (i) the Buyers calculation in reasonable detail of the Net Working Capital as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the " _Final Closing Net Working Capital_ ") and (ii) the Buyers calculation of the amount of any payments required pursuant to Section 2.2(h) (the " _Adjustment Calculation_ "). The Buyers calculation of the Final Closing Net Working Capital shall be made based on the financial books and records of the Business as of the close of business on the Closing Date using the same accounting methodologies and procedures used to calculate the Reference Closing Net Working Capital as set forth in _Schedule 2.2(a)_. An appropriate dollar-for-dollar adjustment shall be made in the Final Closing Net Working Capital to take into account any Pre-Closing GOB Sales. With respect to any Store Closing Locations at which a physical inventory has been 

   ##### 

  

    

conducted in accordance with the applicable Agency Agreement prior to the
delivery of the Adjustment Notice, the Final Closing Net Working Capital
shall take into account the results of such physical inventory applying the
valuation methodologies, as applicable, set forth in the applicable Agency
Agreement. The Buyer shall include with the Adjustment Notice delivered to the
Sellers copies of all inventory and valuation reports prepared in connection
with such physical inventories. 

  

 (d) Within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Adjustment Notice, the Sellers shall deliver to the Buyer a written response in which the Sellers shall either (i) agree in writing with the Adjustment Calculation, in which case such calculation shall be final and binding on the parties for purposes of Section 2.2(h), or (ii) dispute the Adjustment Calculation by delivering to the Buyer a written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for each such disputed item. 

  

 (e) If the Sellers fail to take either of the foregoing actions within 30 days after delivery of the Adjustment Notice, then the Sellers shall be deemed to have irrevocably accepted the Adjustment Calculation, in which case, the Adjustment Calculation shall be final and binding on the Parties for purposes of Section 2.2(h). 

  

 (f) If the Sellers timely deliver a Dispute Notice to the Buyer, then the Buyer and the Sellers shall attempt in good faith, for a period of thirty (30) days, to agree on the Adjustment Calculation for purposes of Section 2.2(h). Any resolution by the Buyer and the Sellers during such thirty (30) day period as to any disputed items shall be final and binding on the Parties for purposes of Section 2.2(h). If the Buyer and the Sellers do not resolve all disputed items within thirty (30) days after the date of delivery of the Dispute Notice, then the Buyer and the Sellers shall submit the remaining items in dispute to PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") for resolution. The Buyer and the Sellers shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to render its determination with respect to the items in dispute in a written report that specifies the conclusions of the Independent Accounting Firm as to each item in dispute and the resulting Adjustment Calculation. The Buyer and the Sellers shall each use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to render its determination within thirty (30) days after referral of the items to such firm or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable. The Independent Accounting Firms determination of the Adjustment Calculation as set forth in its report shall be final and binding on the Parties for purposes of Section 2.2(h). The Buyer shall revise the calculation of the Final Closing Net Working Capital as appropriate to reflect the resolution of the issues in dispute pursuant to this Section 2.2(f). The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be shared by the Buyer and the Sellers in inverse proportion to the relative amounts of the disputed amount determined to be for the account of the Buyer and the Sellers, respectively. 

  

 (g) For purposes of complying with this Section 2.2, the Buyer and the Sellers shall furnish to each other and to the Independent Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed items as the Independent Accounting Firm may request and are available to that party (or its independent public accountants) and shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the Independent Accounting Firm any material related to the disputed items and to discuss the items with the Independent Accounting Firm. If the Buyer elects to conduct a physical inventory in connection with its calculation of the Final Closing Net Working Capital, the Buyer shall notify the Sellers in advance of such inventory, shall permit representatives of the Sellers to be present during such inventory and shall provide to the Sellers copies of all reports and other records and information produced in connection with such inventory. 

  

 (h) If the Final Closing Net Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.2, is greater than the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, then the Sellers shall be entitled to receive a distribution of the Escrow Amount and the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers an amount equal to 

   ##### 

  

    

such excess. If the Final Closing Net Working Capital, as finally determined
pursuant to this Section 2.2, is less than the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital, then the Buyer shall be entitled to receive a distribution of a
portion of the Escrow Amount equal to the amount of such shortfall, and the
Sellers shall be entitled to receive a distribution of the balance, if any,
of the Escrow Amount. If the Escrow Amount is not sufficient to cover the
amount the Sellers are required to pay to the Buyer pursuant to the preceding
sentence, the Sellers shall pay the shortfall to the Buyer. 

  

 (i) All distributions and payments pursuant to Section 2.2(h) shall be made within five Business Days following the final determination of the Final Closing Net Working Capital in accordance with this Section 2.2; _provided_ that if the Sellers deliver a Dispute Notice to the Buyer in accordance with Section 2.2(f) and the aggregate value of all disputed items is less than the Escrow Amount, the Sellers and the Buyer shall promptly instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to distribute to the Sellers the portion of the Escrow Amount that is not in dispute and to retain the balance of the Escrow Amount pending final resolution of such disputes in accordance with Section 2.2(f). 

  

 (j) The Initial Purchase Price as adjusted in accordance with this Section 2.2 is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Purchase Price_." 

  

 2.3 _Assumed Liabilities and Excluded Liabilities_  

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Buyer hereby agrees that at the Closing, or such other date or dates provided in Section 1.4, it shall assume and become responsible for the following liabilities and obligations of the Seller Group existing as of such time and arising from the operation of the Business prior to the Closing or the other date or dates provided in Section 1.4, as applicable (collectively, the " _Assumed Liabilities_ "):

Within ten (10) days following the date of the execution of this Agreement, the Sellers shall file a motion with the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to Section 363 and Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code (the " _Sale Motion_ ") seeking (a) approval of the provisions of this Agreement and the Agency Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, (b) assumption and assignment of the Assumed Real Property Leases and Assumed Contracts from the Sellers to the Buyers under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, and (c) entry of the Sale Order. The Sale Motion shall seek the designation of the Buyer as the "Initial Bidder" for the Assets under the terms of this Agreement and shall seek Bankruptcy Court approval of the provisions set forth in this Agreement, including the payment of the Break Up Fee described in Section 11.4. Simultaneously with the filing of the Sale Motion, the Sellers shall file a motion with the Bankruptcy Court (the " _Bid Procedures Motion_ ") seeking entry of the Bid Procedures Order. The Bid Procedures Order shall not be modified without the consent of the Buyer. 

  

 11.2 _Motions and Notices Regarding Sale of Assets and Assumption and Assignment of Assumed Real Estate Leases and Assumed Contracts_. 

  

 (a) Sellers shall seek prompt entry of the Sale Order pursuant to the Sale Motion after sufficient notice has been given, which Sale Order shall include, among other things, findings of fact and conclusions of law that the Buyer is not a successor in interest to the Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers and that the Buyer is a good faith purchaser pursuant to Bankruptcy Code Section 363(m). 

  

 (b) The Sellers covenant that, to the extent that they have not done so prior to the date of this Agreement, they shall promptly serve the third parties who are parties to Assumed Real Estate Leases and Assumed Contracts (such third parties being " _Cure Obligees_ ") with written notice of proposed cures on the Assumed Real Estate Leases and Assumed Contracts (such notice being the " _Proposed Cure Notice_ "), which Proposed Cure Notice shall be provided to the Buyer within the time periods provided by the Bid Procedures Order. The Proposed Cure Notice shall, as set forth in the Bid Procedures Order, establish a deadline reasonably in advance of the Closing Date by which Cure Obligees must object to respective proposed cures or be deemed to have waived any such objection. 

  

 11.3 _Requests for Information_. From the date of the approval of the Bid Procedures Order (a) if the Sellers supply any information regarding the Business to a potential bidder not heretofore given to the Buyer, the Sellers shall further provide the Buyer with a copy of such information within 24 hours of providing that information to any other potential bidder; and (b) with respect to any bid, term sheet, or written expression of interest by any other party for any asset or assets of any Seller, or any other reorganization proposal, submitted prior to the bid deadline established in the Bid Procedures Order, the Sellers shall provide the Buyer with prompt notice of such proposal and a copy of such proposal within 48 hours of either Sellers receipt thereof. 

  

 11.4 _Break Up Fee_. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason except pursuant to Section 10.1(a) or (g), then in consideration of the real and substantial benefits conferred by the Buyer upon the Sellers bankruptcy estates by providing a minimum floor bid upon which the Sellers, their creditors and the other bidders were able to rely and in consideration of the time, expense and risks associated with serving as the "Initial Bidder," including legal fees and expenses, overhead costs, due diligence expenses and other similar expenses related to the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and of all related transactional documentation, due diligence and representation, the Sellers shall pay to the Buyer at the time of the closing of the sale of the Assets to the successful bidder for the Assets, provided that the 

   ##### 

  

 

Buyer is not then in material default of its obligations under this Agreement,
an amount equal to $6,450,000, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court (the " _Break Up Fee_ "). The Sellers and Buyer agree and stipulate
that the Buyers have provided a mutual benefit to the Sellers estates by
increasing the likelihood that the best possible price for the Assets shall
be received and that the Break Up Fee is reasonable and appropriate in light
of the size and nature of the proposed sale transactions and comparable
transactions, the commitments that have been made and the efforts that have
and shall be expended by the Buyer and were necessary to induce the Buyer
to pursue the transactions contemplated hereby under the terms of this
Agreement. The Break Up Fee also shall serve as liquidated damages with
respect to any claims the Buyer may have against the Sellers in connection
with the Sellers failure to close the sale of the Assets to the Buyer
as contemplated by this Agreement and Buyers shall provide a release to the
Sellers of any and all such claims upon payment of the Break Up Fee. 

   

 11.5 _Defense of Orders_. The Sellers, at their sole cost and expense, shall diligently defend the Bid Procedures Order and the Sale Order in the event that any motion for reconsideration or appeal of such Orders is filed.
