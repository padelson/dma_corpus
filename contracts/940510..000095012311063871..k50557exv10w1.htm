occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by such Party in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by such Party. Each Party
accordingly agrees that, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article&nbsp;10, in
addition to any other remedy to which the other Parties are entitled at law or in equity, the other
Parties are entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement by such Party and
otherwise to enforce specifically the provisions of this Agreement against such Party. Each Party
expressly waives any requirement that any other Party obtain any bond or provide any indemnity in
connection with any action seeking injunctive relief or specific enforcement of the provisions of
this Agreement. If the Sellers assert a claim for actual damages against the Buyer based on an
alleged breach, the Sellers must bring an action against the Buyer in Bankruptcy Court seeking
recovery of actual damages, and the Deposit will be held by the Escrow Agent pending a final
resolution of such claims. Actual damages shall include the reasonable legal fees and expenses
incurred by the Sellers in connection with the action in Bankruptcy Court described in the
preceding sentence. To the extent required to compensate the Sellers for any actual damages
awarded by final order of the Bankruptcy Court, the Deposit will be used for such purpose. To the
extent not required for the payment of such award, the Deposit or any balance thereof will be
returned to the Buyer.
