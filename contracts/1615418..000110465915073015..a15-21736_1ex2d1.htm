 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 **PURCHASE AND SALE**

 



 

Section 2.01. _Purchase and Sale_. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, and in reliance upon the representations, warranties and
covenants contained herein, at the Closing, Buyer shall purchase the Bank
Common Stock from Parent, and Parent shall sell and transfer all of the Bank
Common Stock to Buyer, free and clear of any Lien.

 



 

Section 2.02. _Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) _Determination of Purchase Price_. Subject to the provisions of this
_Section 2.02_, the purchase price for all of the Bank Common Stock (the "
_Purchase Price_ ") shall consist of a cash payment equal to 160% of the
stated book value of the Bank Common Stock as of the Purchase Price
Determination Date, excluding the effect of (i) any capital contributed to the
Bank by Parent after the date hereof, (ii) third party expenses incurred by
Parent or the Bank in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (iii) the taking by the Bank of any of the actions required under
Sections 5.17(b), 5.17(c) and 5.17(e) hereunder; and (iv) all change of
control and severance payments paid or owed to the employees of the Bank in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, less goodwill
and core deposit intangibles (the " _Bank Tangible Book Value_ "); provided,
however, that the Purchase Price shall not exceed $105,000,000. To the extent
that the Bank Tangible Book

 



      
 

 



 

Value exceeds $65,625,000 as of the Purchase Price Determination Date, the
Bank shall declare and pay a dividend to Parent (the " _Bank Dividend_ ") on
the Closing Date for the amount of the Bank Tangible Book Value in excess of
$65,625,000 and, in such event, the Bank Tangible Book Value shall be
$65,625,000. For purposes of this _Section 2.02_, the " _Purchase Price
Determination Date_ " shall be the last day of the month immediately preceding
the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) _Delivery of Final Closing Statement_. Not less than five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare in good faith and deliver
to Buyer a statement (the " _Final Closing Statement_ ") reflecting the Bank
Tangible Book Value as of the Purchase Price Determination Date (the " _Final
Bank Tangible Book Value_ "). Subject to applicable law, Buyer shall have the
right to review, and shall have reasonable access to, all relevant work
papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared by Parent, the Bank,
their Subsidiaries or their respective accountants in connection with ParentÂ’s
preparation of the Final Closing Statement, as well as to executive, finance
and accounting personnel of Parent, the Bank or their Subsidiaries and any
other information which Buyer may reasonably request in connection with its
review of the Final Closing Statement; provided that Parent, the Bank and
their Subsidiaries shall not be required to provide Buyer access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would reasonably be
expected to waive the protection of any privilege or the work product
doctrine. The parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 



 

(c) _Dispute of Final Closing Statement_. In the event Buyer disputes ParentÂ’s
calculation of the Final Bank Tangible Book Value as reflected on the Final
Closing Statement, Buyer shall, within three (3) Business Days following the
delivery of the Final Closing Statement, deliver to Parent written notice of
its objections thereto (the " _Objections Notice_ "), describing the nature of
the dispute in reasonable detail and specifying those items and amounts as to
which Buyer disagrees and, based on the information at its disposal,
specifying BuyerÂ’s good faith proposed calculation of Final Bank Tangible Book
Value. If Buyer does not timely deliver an Objection Notice within such three
(3) Business Day period, the Final Bank Tangible Book Value set forth in the
Final Closing Statement delivered by Parent shall be utilized for the
calculation of the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.02(a)_ of this
Agreement. If Buyer timely delivers an Objection Notice, Buyer and Parent
shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute; provided, however, that
if Buyer and Parent cannot resolve the dispute within two (2) Business Days
after the date of the Objection Notice (the " _Initial Resolution Period_ "),
Buyer and Parent shall appoint a mutually acceptable independent accounting
firm of national or regional reputation (the " _Neutral Auditor_ ") to
arbitrate the dispute under the rules the Neutral Auditor imposes. The
Neutral Auditor shall be limited to addressing only the particular disputes
referred to in the Objection Notice, and the Neutral AuditorÂ’s resolution of
any disputed item shall be no greater than the higher amount, and no less than
the lower amount, calculated or proposed by Buyer and Parent with respect to
such disputed item, as the case may be. Upon reaching its determination of
the Final Bank Tangible Book Value, the Neutral Auditor shall deliver a copy
of its calculation of the Final Bank Tangible Book Value to Buyer and Parent.
The determination of the Neutral Auditor shall be made within twenty (20) days
after its engagement (which engagement shall be made no later than five (5)
days after the end of the Initial Resolution Period) and, absent

 



      
 

 



 

fraud, shall be final and binding on all the parties. No party or its
Affiliates shall seek further recourse to courts, other tribunals or
otherwise, other than to enforce the final decision of the Neutral Auditor as
to the determination of the Final Bank Tangible Book Value. Fifty percent
(50%) of the aggregate fees, expenses and costs of the Neutral Auditor shall
be borne by Buyer, and the other fifty percent (50%) of such fees, expenses
and costs shall be borne by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, the dispute
resolution process contemplated by this _Section 2.02_ shall be only to
determine the disputed items reflected on the Final Closing Statement and
necessary to the calculation of the Final Bank Tangible Book Value as of the
applicable month-end, regardless of the date on which the Neutral Auditor
delivers its calculation. In the event any dispute in calculating or agreeing
to the Final Bank Tangible Book Value results in the Closing Date occurring
more than ten (10) Business Days from the Purchase Price Determination Date,
the Purchase Price Determination Date shall change to be the tenth (10th)
Business Day prior to the Closing Date and the calculation of the Final Bank
Tangible Book Value shall be determined as of such new Purchase Price
Determination Date using methodology consistent with the resolution of any
dispute by the Neutral Auditor as to the calculation of such amount as of the
original Purchase Price Determination Date.

 



 

Section 2.03. _Closing; Deliverables_.

 



 

(a) _Closing and Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the Stock Sale (the " _Closing_ ") will take place
on the tenth (10th) Business Day of the month following the month in which
either party receives the last of the Regulatory Approvals and all waiting
periods required by law have expired (the date upon which the last of the
Regulatory Approvals has been received and all waiting periods required by law
have expired, the " _Last Regulatory Approval Date_ "), provided however, that
Buyer may defer the Closing until the tenth (10th) Business Day of either the
following month or the next succeeding month upon written notice to Parent

Approval Date, in each case at the offices of Kilpatrick Townsend and Stockton
LLP, 607 14th Street, NW, Suite 900, Washington, DC 20005 at 10:00 a.m. local
time, or at such other place and time as the parties hereto may mutually
agree, provided that on or prior to that date all conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ have been satisfied or waived (the date on which the Closing
occurs, the " _Closing Date_ "). The effective time of the Stock Sale (the "
_Effective Time_ ") shall be 11:58 p.m. on the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) _Deliverables at Closing_. At the Closing:

 



 

(1) Parent shall deliver to Buyer a certificate or certificates evidencing all
the Bank Common Stock, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock powers
duly executed in blank, in proper form for transfer;

 



 

(2) Buyer shall, or shall cause Buyer Bank to, pay to Parent the Purchase
Price by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts
to be designated in writing by Parent to Buyer no later than two (2) Business

(3) Parent shall deliver to Buyer the resignations referred to in _Section
5.16_;

 



       
 

 



 

(4) Parent shall deliver to Buyer the Organizational Documents of and

(6) The Bank shall pay the Bank Dividend to Parent as contemplated by _Section
2.02(a)_, if applicable.

 



 

Section 2.04. _Bank Merger_. Immediately following the Effective Time, the
Bank shall merge with and into Buyer Bank, with Buyer Bank as the surviving
entity (the " _Bank Merger_ "), pursuant to the Bank Merger Agreement
substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the " _Bank Merger Agreement_
"). The trustees and officers of Buyer Bank immediately prior to the effective
time of the Bank Merger shall be the initial trustees and officers of the
surviving entity, in each case until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND THE BANK**

 



 

Section 3.01. _Making of Representations and Warranties_.

 



 

(a) On or prior to the date hereof, Parent and the Bank have delivered to
Buyer a schedule (the " _Disclosure Schedule_ ") setting forth, among other
things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in
response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof
or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in
_Article III_ or to one or more of its covenants contained in _Article V_;
provided, however, that the mere inclusion of an exception, fact, circumstance
or event in the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission by Parent
or the Bank that such item represents a material exception, fact, event or
circumstance or that any such item is or would be reasonably likely to result
in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent or the Bank. Any matter
disclosed pursuant to one section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect to any other section or
subsection if the applicability of such item to such other section or
subsection is reasonably apparent on its face.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, Parent and the Bank hereby
jointly and severally represent and warrant to Buyer that the statements
contained in this _Article III_ are correct as of the date of this Agreement,
except as to any representation which specifically speaks as of an earlier
date (including without limitation representations made as of "the date
hereof"), which only need be correct as of such earlier date.

 



 

Section 3.02. _Organization, Standing and Authority_.

 



 

(a) Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Parent has all
necessary corporate

the conduct of its business requires such qualification.

 



 

(b) The Bank is a commercial bank duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Bank has all
necessary corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now
conducted. The Bank has all necessary power and authority (including all

which are legally required) to own, lease and operate its properties and to
engage in the business and activities now conducted by it. The BankÂ’s deposits
are insured by the FDIC in the manner and to the full extent provided by
applicable Law, and all premiums and assessments required to be paid in
connection therewith have been paid by the Bank when due.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of 1,500,000 shares of

shares of Bank Common Stock issued and outstanding, all of which are owned by
Parent and have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and

issue or sell any shares of Bank Common Stock or other equity interests, and

Section 3.16. _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or arrangements
maintained, contributed to, or required to be contributed to by the Bank, any
of its Subsidiaries or related organizations described in Code Sections
414(b),(c) or (m) (" _Controlled Group Members_ ") (i) covering current or
former employees of the Bank, any of its Subsidiaries or Controlled Group
Members (collectively, the " _Bank Employees_ "), (ii) covering current or
former directors of the Bank, any of its Subsidiaries, or Controlled Group
Members, or (iii) with respect to which the Bank, any of its Subsidiaries, or
any Controlled Group Members has or may have any liability or contingent
liability (including liability arising from affiliation under Section 414 of
the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA) including, but not limited to, "employee
benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, health/welfare,
change in control, fringe benefit, deferred compensation, stock option, stock
purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock based, incentive, bonus plans and
other policies, plans or arrangements whether or not subject to ERISA (the "
_Benefit Plans_ "), are identified and described in _Disclosure Schedule
Section 3.16(a)_. None of the Bank, any of its Subsidiaries or any Controlled
Group Member has any stated plan, intention or commitment to establish any new
benefit plan or to modify any Benefit Plan (except to the extent required by
law).

 



 

(b) With respect to each Benefit Plan, as applicable, Parent has provided
Buyer with true and complete copies of (i) all Benefit Plan documents and
amendments thereto, (ii) any trust instruments and insurance contracts forming

three most recently completed plan years, (v) the most recent IRS
determination, opinion and advisory letters, (vi) any material correspondence
from any regulatory agency, (vii) any service contracts, and (viii) any

(c) All Benefit Plans are in material compliance in form and operation with
all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Each Benefit Plan which is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code ("401(a) Plan") has
received a favorable determination, opinion, or advisory letter from the IRS,
and Parent and the Bank are not aware of any circumstance that could
reasonably be expected to result in revocation of any such favorable
determination, opinion, or advisory letter or the loss of the qualification of
such 401(a) Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, and, to the Knowledge of
Parent and the Bank, nothing has occurred that would be reasonably expected to
result in the 401(a) Plan ceasing to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code. All Benefit Plans have been administered in material compliance with
their terms. There is no pending or, to ParentÂ’s and the BankÂ’s Knowledge,
threatened litigation or regulatory action relating to the Benefit Plans.
Neither the Bank nor any of its Subsidiaries or any Controlled Group Members
has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Benefit Plan, including a
401(a) Plan, that could reasonably be expected to subject the Bank or any of
its Subsidiaries or any Controlled Group

 



      
 

 



 

Members to a material tax or penalty under any Law including, but not limited
to, Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. No 401(a) Plan has
been submitted under or been the subject of an IRS voluntary compliance
program or Department of Labor voluntary fiduciary correction program
submission within the past three years. There are no audits, investigations,
inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent or the Bank,
threatened by the IRS, the Department of Labor, any other regulatory agency,
any state, political subdivision, municipality or instrumentality with respect
to any Benefit Plan.

 



 

(d) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is
reasonably expected to be incurred by the Bank, any of its Subsidiaries or
Controlled Group Members with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated
"single employer plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA,
currently or formerly maintained by the Bank, any of its Subsidiaries,
Controlled Group Members or any entity which is considered one employer with
the Bank, any of its Subsidiaries or Controlled Group Members under Section
4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"). Neither the
Bank nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained a plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Neither the Bank nor any ERISA Affiliate has
contributed to (or been obligated to contribute to) a "multiemployer plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA at any time and none of the Bank,
any of its Subsidiaries or Controlled Group Members has incurred, and does not
reasonably expect to incur, any withdrawal liability with respect to a
multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of
whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a
"reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA has been
required to be filed for any Benefit Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate or will be
required to be filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(e) All contributions required to be made with respect to all Benefit Plans
have been timely made or have been reflected in the Financial Statements. No
Benefit Plan or single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has failed to
satisfy the minimum funding standards of Section 412 of the Code or Section
302 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver.

 



 

(f) No Benefit Plan provides or has any liability to provide life insurance,
medical or other employee welfare benefits to any Bank Employee upon his or
her retirement or termination of employment for any reason, except as may be
required by Law (other than death benefits when termination occurs upon
death).

 



 

(g) All Benefit Plans that are group health plans have been operated in
material compliance with the group health plan continuation requirements of
Section 4980B of the Code, as well as, all other applicable sections of ERISA,
the Code, and the Public Health Service Act including, but not limited to,
HIPAA, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended and
including its implementing regulations and other guidance).

 



 

(h) Except as provided for in this Agreement, the execution of this Agreement,
shareholder approval of this Agreement or consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (i) entitle any Bank
Employee to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any
termination of employment after the date hereof,

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting (except as required by law) or
trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any
other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans, (iii) result
in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any of the Benefit Plans,
(iv) result in any payment that would be a "parachute payment" to a
"disqualified individual" as those terms are defined in Section 280G of the
Code, (v) limit or restrict the right of the Bank or, after the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, to
merge, amend or terminate any of the Benefit Plans, or (vi) result in payments
under any of the Benefit Plans which would not be deductible under Section
280G of the Code.

 



 

(i) Each Benefit Plan that is a deferred compensation plan or arrangement is
in material compliance with Section 409A of the Code, to the extent
applicable. All elections made with respect to compensation deferred under an
arrangement subject to Section 409A of the Code have been made in material
compliance with the requirements of Section 409A(a)(4) of the Code, to the
extent applicable. None of the Bank, any of its Subsidiaries or Controlled
Group Members (i) has taken any action, or has failed to take any action, that
has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in any material
interest or tax penalties under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code or (ii) has
agreed to reimburse or indemnify any participant in a Benefit Plan for any
interest or penalties under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code that may be
currently due or triggered in the future.

 



 

(j) The Bank and its Subsidiaries have correctly classified all individuals
who directly or indirectly perform services for the Bank, any of its
Subsidiaries or Controlled Group Members for purposes of each Benefit Plan,
ERISA, the Code, unemployment compensation laws, workersÂ’ compensation laws
and all other applicable Laws.

 



 

Section 3.17. _Labor Matters_. Neither the Bank nor any of its Subsidiaries is
a party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is
there any proceeding pending or, to ParentÂ’s and the BankÂ’s Knowledge
threatened, asserting that the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries has committed
an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations
Act) or seeking to compel the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries to bargain with
any labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is there
any strike or other labor dispute involving it pending or, to ParentÂ’s and the
BankÂ’s Knowledge, threatened, nor is Parent or the Bank aware of any activity
involving Bank Employees seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or
engaging in other organizational activity.

 



 

Section 3.18. _Environmental Matters_.

 



 

(a) To the ParentÂ’s and BankÂ’s Knowledge as of the date hereof, there has not
been a Release of any Hazardous Substance at, on or under (i) any real
property currently owned, operated or leased by the Bank or any of its
Subsidiaries or any predecessor, or (ii) during the ownership, operation or

correct and complete in all material respects and have been prepared in
substantial compliance with all applicable Laws. All Taxes due and owing by

Return) have been paid other than Taxes that have been reserved or accrued on
the balance sheet of the Bank and which the Bank is contesting in good faith.
Neither Parent nor the Bank is currently the beneficiary of any extension of

been made by any Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where Parent or the
Bank does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by
that jurisdiction. There are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due

Subsidiaries.

their Subsidiaries. Other than with respect to audits that have already been
completed and resolved, neither Parent, the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries
has received from any foreign, federal, state, or local taxing authority
(including jurisdictions where Parent, the Bank and or any of their
Subsidiaries have not filed Tax Returns) any (i) notice indicating an intent
to open an audit or other review, (ii) request for information related to Tax
matters, or (iii) notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount
of Tax proposed, asserted, or assessed by any taxing authority against Parent,
the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Parent has made available to Buyer true and complete copies of the United

understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of Code Section 6662\.
Neither Parent nor the Bank is a party to or bound by any Tax allocation or
sharing agreement. The Bank (i) has not been a member of an affiliated group
filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than the affiliated

liability for the Taxes of any individual, bank, corporation, partnership,
association, joint stock company, business trust, limited liability company,
or unincorporated organization under Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local, or foreign Law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract, or otherwise.

 



 

(g) The unpaid Taxes of Parent and the Bank (i) did not, as of the Balance
Sheet Date, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (which reserve is distinct
and different from any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the
Financial Statements delivered to Buyer (rather than in any notes thereto),
and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time in
accordance with the past custom and practice of Parent and the Bank in filing
their consolidated Tax Returns. Since December 31, 2014, neither Parent nor

or losses, as that term is used in GAAP, outside the Ordinary Course of
Business.

shall, and shall cause each of the Parent Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions,
negotiations, and communications with any Persons with respect to any existing
or potential Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any
inquiry, offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from
Buyer), whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that could

Subsidiaries; (C) any issuance, sale or other disposition of (including by way

purpose to any of the foregoing transactions, or any combination of the

Parent or the Bank all of substantially all of the assets of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including the Bank), taken as a whole, for consideration
consisting of cash and/or securities and (ii) that Parent Board reasonably
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, (A) is reasonably capable of being
completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal, including all conditions contained therein and the
person making such Acquisition Proposal, (B) taking into account any changes
to this Agreement proposed by Buyer in response to such Acquisition Proposal,
as contemplated by paragraph (c) of this _Section 5.07_, and all financial,
legal, regulatory and other aspects of such takeover proposal, including all

favorable to the shareholders of Parent from a financial point of view than
the Stock Sale and (C) for which financing, to the extent required, is then
committed pursuant to a written commitment letter.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.07(a)_, only during the period ending thirty
(30) days after the date of this Agreement, Parent may take any of the actions

bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
breach of this _Section 5.07_; (ii) the Parent Board reasonably determines in
good faith, after consultation with and having considered the advice of its
outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that (A) such Acquisition

Parent shall provide to Buyer any non-public information regarding Parent, the
Bank or their Subsidiaries provided to any other Person which was not
previously provided to Buyer, such additional information to be provided no
later than the time of provision of such information to such other party.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) Parent shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Buyer in
writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any information is
requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated
or continued with, Parent or the Parent Representatives, in each case in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall indicate the
name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or making such

(d) Neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or
(ii) enter into (or cause Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into) any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other

_Section 5.07(b)_) or (B) requiring Parent to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Stock Sale or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 5.07(d)_, only during the period ending thirty
(30) days after the date of this Agreement, the Parent Board may approve or
recommend a Superior Proposal, or enter in an agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Transaction, if after the third (3rd) Business Day following
BuyerÂ’s receipt of a notice (the " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") from
Parent advising Buyer that the Parent Board has decided that a bona fide
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not result
from a breach of this _Section 5.07_) constitutes a Superior Proposal if, but
only if, (i) the Parent Board has determined in good faith, after consultation
with and having considered the advice of outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor, that it is reasonably necessary to take such actions to
comply with its fiduciary duties to ParentÂ’s shareholders under applicable
Law, (ii) during the three (3) Business Day period after receipt of the Notice
of Superior Proposal by Buyer (the " _Notice Period_ "), Parent and the Parent
Board shall have cooperated and negotiated in good faith with Buyer to make
such adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement as would enable Parent to proceed with the Stock Sale;
provided, however, that Buyer shall not have any obligation to propose any
adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and (iii) at the end of the Notice Period, after taking into
account any such adjusted, modified or amended terms as may have been proposed
by Buyer since its receipt of such Notice of Superior Proposal, the Parent
Board has again in good faith made the determination (A) in clause (i) of this
_Section 5.07(e)_ and (B) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to the Superior
Proposal, Parent shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Superior
Proposal to Buyer and again comply with the requirements of this _Section
5.07(e)_, except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to two (2) Business
Days.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.08. _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) All persons who are employees of the Bank who are employed immediately
prior to the Closing shall become employees of Buyer or Buyer Bank (the "
_Bank Continuing Employees_ "). Except as otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement or in any agreement with a particular Bank Continuing Employee, all
of the Bank Continuing Employees shall be employed at the will of Buyer and no
contractual right to employment or to employment in any position or to any
level of compensation shall inure to such employees because of this Agreement.
Following the Closing, Buyer shall maintain or cause to be maintained employee
benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the benefit of Bank
Continuing Employees that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to
the employee benefit and compensation opportunities that are generally made
available to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates.

 



 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates (collectively, " _Buyer Benefit Plans_ ") in which any Bank
Continuing Employees will participate effective as of the Closing, Buyer
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to recognize all service of the Bank Continuing Employees with the Bank as if
such service were with Buyer, for vesting and eligibility purposes in any
Buyer Benefit Plan in which such Bank Continuing Employees may be eligible to
participate after the Closing Date; provided, however, such service shall not
be recognized to the extent that (x) such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits or (y) such service was not recognized under the
corresponding Benefit Plan of the Bank.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall take such action, and shall cause
the Bank to take such action, as required to remove the Bank as a
participating employer of ParentÂ’s 401(k) savings plan.

 



 

(d) Not later than December 31, 2015, Parent and the Bank shall take all
actions necessary to amend the BankÂ’s Change in Control Severance Benefits
Plan (the " _Bank Severance Plan_ ") prior to a Change in Control (as defined
in the Bank Severance Plan) to: (i) enumerate the members of the "Special
Class" of Bank employees provided for under the Bank Severance Plan and
prevent any additional Bank employees from being added to the Special Class,
and (ii) clarify that a participant in the plan who rejects a comparable
employment position with a successor to the Bank following a Change in Control
(as defined in the Bank Severance Plan) will not be entitled to any severance
benefit under the Bank Severance Plan.

 



 

(e) This _Section 5.08_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 5.08_,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 5.08_. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend
or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this _Section 5.08_
shall not create any right in any employee or any other Person to any
continued employment with Buyer or any of its Affiliates or compensation or
benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer, on the
one hand, and Parent and the Bank, on the other hand, acknowledge and agree
that any and all amounts due to employees of the Bank, including accrued
bonuses, under existing employment contracts, bonus plans, change of control
agreements or similar agreements, will be honored by Buyer and the Bank and
paid out in full accordance with the terms and conditions of such agreements.

 



 

Section 5.09. _Notification of Certain Changes_. Parent shall promptly advise
Buyer of any change or event having, or which could reasonably be expected to
have, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Bank or any of its
Subsidiaries, and Buyer and Parent shall promptly advise the other party of
any change or event which it believes would, or which could reasonably be
expected to, cause or constitute, a material breach of any of its or, in the
case of Parent, BankÂ’s, representations, warranties or covenants contained
herein.From time to time prior to the Effective Time (and on the date prior to
the Closing Date), Parent will supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule
delivered in connection with the execution of this Agreement to reflect any
matter which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement,
would have been required to be set forth or described in such Disclosure
Schedule or which is necessary to correct any information in such Disclosure
Schedule which has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement
or amendment to any Disclosure Schedule or provision of information relating
to the subject matter of any Disclosure Schedule after the date of this
Agreement shall have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in _Section 7.02(a)_ or _Section 7.03(a)_ hereof,
as the case may be, or compliance by Buyer or Parent or the Bank with the
respective covenants and agreements of such parties set forth herein;
_provided, however,_ that if Buyer has the right to, but does not elect to
terminate this Agreement within thirty (30) Business Days of its receipt of
such Schedule Supplement, then Buyer shall be deemed to have irrevocably
waived any right to terminate this Agreement with respect to such matter under
_Section 9.01(d)_.

 



 

Section 5.10. _Current Information_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, each of Parent and Buyer will cause one or
more of its designated representatives to confer on a regular and frequent

their Subsidiaries and Buyer and its Subsidiaries, respectively. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees to provide to Buyer (i) a copy of each
report filed by Parent, the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries with a

profit and loss statement within three (3) Business Days of the end of the

condition and daily profit and loss statement, which shall be provided within
three (3) Business Days of such request.

 



 

Section 5.11. _Board Packages_. The Bank shall distribute a copy of any Bank
board package, including the agenda and any draft minutes, any monthly
financial package and any corporate credit and asset review committee report,
to Buyer via secure email or similar electronic means at the same time in
which it distributes a copy of such package to the board of directors of the
Bank; provided, however, that the Bank shall not be required to copy Buyer

 



      
 

 



 

on any documents that disclose confidential discussions of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or any other matter that BankÂ’s board of
directors has been advised by counsel that such distribution to Buyer may
violate a confidentiality obligation or fiduciary duty or any Law or
regulation, or may result in a waiver of the BankÂ’s attorney-client privilege.

 



 

Section 5.12. _Transition; Informational Systems Conversion_. From and after
the date hereof, Buyer and Parent shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to facilitate the integration of the Bank with the business of Buyer
following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall meet
on a regular basis to discuss and plan for the conversion of the data
processing and related electronic informational systems of the Bank and each
of its Subsidiaries (the " _Informational Systems Conversion_ ") to those used
by Buyer and Buyer Bank, which planning shall include, but not be limited to,
(a) discussion of third-party service provider arrangements of the Bank and
each of its Subsidiaries; (b) non-renewal or changeover, after the Effective

proprietary or self-provided system services; and (e) any other actions
necessary and appropriate to facilitate the conversion, as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time. Buyer shall promptly reimburse Parent on request
for any reasonable out-of-pocket fees, expenses or charges that Parent may
incur as a result of taking, at the request of Buyer, any action prior to the
Effective Time to facilitate the Informational Systems Conversion.

 



 

Section 5.13. _Access to Customers and Suppliers_. From and after the date
hereof, Parent shall, upon BuyerÂ’s reasonable request, introduce Buyer and its
representatives to suppliers of the Bank and its Subsidiaries for the purpose
of facilitating the integration of the Bank and its business into that of
Buyer Bank. In addition, after satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.01(a)_, the Bank shall, upon BuyerÂ’s reasonable request, introduce
Buyer and its representatives to customers of the Bank and its Subsidiaries
for the purpose of facilitating the integration of the Bank and its business
into that of Buyer Bank. Any interaction between Buyer and ParentÂ’s, the
BankÂ’s and any of their SubsidiariesÂ’ customers and suppliers shall be
coordinated by the Bank. The Bank shall have the right to participate in any
discussions between Buyer and the BankÂ’s customers and suppliers.

 



 

Section 5.14. _Environmental Assessments_.

 



 

(a) Upon BuyerÂ’s request, and to the extent that Bank or any of its
Subsidiaries does not have current Phase I reports meeting the U.S. EPA "All
Appropriate Inquiry" standards in 40 C.F.R. Part 312 already in its
possession, during the thirty (30) day period following the date of this
Agreement Parent and Bank shall cooperate with and grant access to an
environmental consulting firm selected and paid for by Buyer (the
"Environmental Consultant"), during normal business hours (or at such other
times as may be agreed to by Bank), to any property set forth on Disclosure
Schedule Section 3.31(a) for the purpose of conducting an ASTM E1527-13 Phase
I, as it relates to providing an environmental site assessment to determine
whether any such property may be impacted by a "recognized environmental
condition," as that term is defined by ASTM. Each Phase I shall be delivered

 



      
 

 



 

in counterpart copies to Buyer and Bank, and will include customary language
allowing both Buyer and Bank to rely upon its findings and conclusions. .

 



 

(b) To the extent the final version of any Phase I identifies any "recognized
environmental condition," Buyer can request access be granted to BuyerÂ’s
Environmental Consultant, during normal business hours (or at such other times
as may be agreed by the parties), to the property covered by such Phase I for
the purpose of conducting a Phase II limited site assessment, including
subsurface investigation of soil, soil vapor, and groundwater, designed to
further investigate and evaluate any "recognized environmental condition"
identified in the Phase I or if the Phase I identifies the presence or
potential presence of any Hazardous Substance. Pursuant to a scope of work
prepared by BuyerÂ’s Environmental Consultant, Parent may grant such request,
subject to the execution of an access agreement between Buyer and the Bank.
The cost of any Phase II limited site assessment shall be borne by Buyer. If
Parent denies BuyerÂ’s request to conduct any Phase II site assessment that
Buyer is entitled to request pursuant to this _Section 5.14_, Buyer shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Parent
delivered within ten (10) Business Days of ParentÂ’s denial of such request and
the parties shall have no further obligations under this Agreement except as
contemplated by _Section 5.05_ and _Section 5.18_.

 



 

(c) Any work conducted by the Environmental Consultant pursuant to subsection
(b) ("Additional Environmental Assessment") will be pursuant to a scope of
work prepared by the Environmental Consultant and reasonably acceptable to
Bank and Buyer.

 



 

(d) The reports of any Additional Environmental Assessment will be given
directly to Buyer and to the Bank by the Environmental Consultant.

 



 

(e) If any Phase I or Phase II site assessment identifies any matter that
would give rise to a breach of any representation or warranty of Parent and
the Bank set forth in this Agreement that would give rise to BuyerÂ’s right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(c), Parent shall within ten
(10) days of receipt of such assessment advise Buyer whether it will cure such
breach by remediating the identified matter. If Parent elects to remediate the
identified matter, Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.01(c) with respect to the identified matter and Buyer
shall have no right to indemnification or contribution from Parent, the Bank
or their Affiliates pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise with respect to such
matter. If Parent does not elect to remediate the identified matter, Buyer
shall retain its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.01(c), provided that such right must be exercised within ten (10) Business
Days of receiving notice of ParentÂ’s election not to remediate the identified
matter. If Buyer does not elect to terminate this Agreement during such ten
(10) Business Day period, it will be deemed to have waived its right to
terminate this Agreement with respect to the identified matter and Buyer shall
have no right to indemnification or contribution from Parent, the Bank or
their Affiliates pursuant to _Article VIII_ or otherwise with respect to such
matter. If any Phase I or Phase II site assessment identifies any matter that
would give rise to a breach of any representation or warranty of Parent and
the Bank set forth in this Agreement, but such breach would not give rise to
BuyerÂ’s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(c)_,
Buyer shall have no right to indemnification or contribution from Parent, the
Bank or their Affiliates pursuant to _Article VIII_ or otherwise with respect
to such matter. For purposes of this _Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _5.14(e)_ , Parent shall be deemed to have "remediated" any matter for which
it has committed to bear the estimated cost of remediation or it has purchased
insurance that is expected to cover the estimated cost of remediation.

 



 

Section 5.15. _Certain Litigation_. In the event that any shareholder
litigation related to this Agreement or the Stock Sale and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is brought, or, to ParentÂ’s and
the BankÂ’s Knowledge, threatened, against the Bank and/or the members of the
board of directors of the Bank prior to the Effective Time, the Bank shall
consult with Buyer regarding the defense or settlement of such litigation, and
no such settlement shall be agreed to without BuyerÂ’s prior written consent
(not to be unreasonably withheld). The Bank shall promptly notify Buyer of any
such shareholder litigation brought, or threatened, against the Bank and/or
members of the board of directors of the Bank within one (1) Business Day
after the Bank receives notice of any such claim or threat, and shall keep
Buyer reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof.

 



 

Section 5.16. _Director Resignations_. Parent and the Bank shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Buyer resignations
of all the directors of the Bank and its Subsidiaries, such resignations to be
effective as of the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 5.17. _Coordination_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take any actions Buyer may reasonably
request from time to time to better prepare the parties for integration of the
operations of the Bank with Buyer Bank, including without limitation the
preparation and filing of all documentation that is necessary or desirable to
obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of third parties or
Governmental Authorities to close and/or consolidate any Buyer Bank or Bank
branches or facilities. Buyer shall reimburse the Bank for any out-of-pocket
costs or expenses associated with meeting any such requests. Without limiting
the foregoing, senior officers of Parent or the Bank and Buyer shall meet from
time to time as Buyer may reasonably request, and in any event not less
frequently than monthly, to review the financial and operational affairs of
the Bank and its Subsidiaries, and Parent shall give due consideration to
BuyerÂ’s input on such matters, with the understanding that, notwithstanding
any other provision contained in this Agreement, neither Buyer nor Buyer Bank
shall under any circumstance be permitted to exercise control of the Bank or
any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. The Bank shall permit
representatives of Buyer and Buyer Bank to be onsite at the Bank to facilitate
integration of operations and assist with any other coordination efforts as
necessary, provided such representatives shall be under the supervision of the
BankÂ’s personnel while onsite and such efforts shall be conducted in such a
manner as not to interfere with the normal operations of the Bank.

 



 

(b) Upon BuyerÂ’s reasonable request, prior to the Effective Time and
consistent with GAAP and applicable banking laws and regulations, Parent shall
cause each of the Bank and its Subsidiaries to modify or change its loan,
OREO, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies and
practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be
applied, on a basis that is consistent with that of Buyer Bank. In order to
promote a more efficient and orderly integration of operation of the Bank with
Buyer Bank,

 



      
 

 



 

from the date of execution of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time,
as more particularly set forth in and subject to the provisions of _Section
5.01(q)_, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Bank
to sell or otherwise divest itself of such investment securities and loans as
are reasonably identified by Buyer and agreed to in writing between Parent and
Buyer from time to time prior to the Closing Date, such identification to
include a statement as to BuyerÂ’s business reasons for such divestitures.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such modifications, changes or divestitures
of the type described in this _Section 5.17(b)_ need be made prior to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01(a)_.

 



 

(c) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Bank,
consistent with GAAP and regulatory accounting principles, to adjust, at
BuyerÂ’s reasonable request, internal control procedures which are consistent
with BuyerÂ’s and Buyer BankÂ’s current internal control procedures to allow
Buyer to fulfill its reporting requirement under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, provided, however, that no such adjustments need be made prior to
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01(a)_.

 



 

(d) No accrual or reserve or change in policy or procedure made by the Bank or
any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 5.17 shall constitute or be
deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of this Agreement
or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach, violation
or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of any such
adjustment shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of previously
furnished financial statements or information and shall not be construed as
concurrence of Parent or its management with any such adjustments.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall take any
actions Buyer may reasonably request in connection with negotiating any
amendments, modifications or terminations of any Leases or Material Contracts,
including but not limited to, actions necessary to cause any such amendments,
modifications or terminations to become effective prior to, or immediately
upon, the Closing, and shall cooperate with Buyer and use commercially
reasonable efforts to negotiate specific provisions that may be reasonably
requested by Buyer in connection with any such any amendment, modification or
termination.

 



 

(f) Subject to _Section 5.17(b)_, Buyer and Parent shall cooperate (i) to
minimize any potential adverse impact to Buyer under Financial Accounting
Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805 (Business
Combinations), and (ii) to allow Buyer to obtain all information necessary for
Buyer, in its reasonable discretion, to timely make all purchase accounting
adjustments in accordance with GAAP.

 



 

(g) Parent and the Bank shall take all actions necessary and within their
power to (i) cause all applicable Governmental Authorities to approve the Bank
Dividend and (ii) if necessary pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, to
authorize, declare and pay the Bank Dividend on the Closing Date.

 



 

(h) Buyer and the Bank agree to take all action necessary and appropriate to
cause the Bank to merge with Buyer Bank in accordance with applicable Laws and
the terms of the

 



      
 

 



 

Bank Merger Agreement immediately following the Effective Time, or such later
time, if any, as determined by Buyer.

 



 

Section 5.18. _Confidentiality_. In addition to the partiesÂ’ respective
obligations under the existing non-disclosure agreement previously entered
into between the parties or their duly authorized representatives, which
obligations are hereby reaffirmed and adopted, and incorporated by reference
herein, each party hereto shall, and shall cause its directors, Executive
Officers, advisers and agents to, maintain the confidentiality of all
confidential information, whether written or oral, furnished to it by the
other party concerning its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ businesses, operations, and
financial positions and shall not use such information for any purpose except
in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For
purposes of this _Section 5.18_, the term "confidential information" shall
not include any information that (i) at the time of disclosure or thereafter
is generally available to and known to the public, other than by a breach of
this Agreement by the disclosing party, (ii) was available to the disclosing
party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the non-disclosing
party or (iii) was independently acquired or developed without violating any
obligations of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.19. _Insurance_. Following the Closing Date, the Bank and its
Subsidiaries shall no longer be insured under any insurance policy of Parent.

 



 

Section 5.20. _Intercompany Matters_.

 



 

(a) At or prior to the Closing, Parent and the Bank shall take, or cause to be
taken, all such actions necessary so that Intercompany Receivables and
Intercompany Payables shall have been settled or paid; provided that, the
parties hereby agree to work in good faith to agree upon mutually acceptable
procedures for the settlement or payment of trailing activities.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Parent and the Bank shall
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to sever all contractual
relationships between Parent and the Bank, including entry into one or more
termination and release agreements, in forms satisfactory to Buyer, pursuant
to which all agreements, contracts, arrangements, covenants, guaranties,
indemnities or other obligations of or between the Bank and its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than the Bank and
its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, whether relating to products, services
or support provided to or by the Bank and its Subsidiaries or otherwise. Such
termination and release agreements shall be effective at the Effective Time
and shall be without expense, penalty, fee or cost to the Bank or its
Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 5.20(b)_ shall have
no effect on any indemnification or other post-Closing obligations of Parent
contemplated in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.21. _D andO Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, and in any
event subject to the provisions of _Section 5.21(b)(iv)_, Buyer shall cause

proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or

 



      
 

 



 

investigative (each a " _Claim_ "), arising out of actions or omissions of
such persons in the course of performing their duties for the Bank occurring
at or before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated
hereby), to the same extent as such persons have the right to be indemnified
pursuant to the Organizational Documents of the Bank, in effect on the date of
this Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Any DandO Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
_Section 5.21_ shall promptly notify Buyer Bank upon learning of any Claim,
provided that failure to so notify shall not affect the obligation of Buyer
Bank under this _Section 5.21_, unless, and only to the extent that, Buyer
Bank is actually prejudiced in the defense of such Claim as a consequence. In
the event of any such Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), Buyer Bank shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Buyer
shall not be liable to such DandO Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of
other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such DandO
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof. If Buyer Bank
elects to assume the defense, it shall keep the DandO Indemnified Parties
apprised of all developments, including settlement offers. If Buyer Bank
elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the DandO Indemnified Parties
advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Buyer
Bank and the DandO Indemnified Parties, the DandO Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to Buyer Bank, and Buyer Bank shall
pay, promptly as statements therefor are received, the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the DandO Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed
one firm in any jurisdiction). The DandO Indemnified Parties shall have the
right to employ separate counsel (either at their own expense or as provided
in the prior sentence) and to participate in the defense of any Claims. In the
event of any Claim, (i) the parties will cooperate in the defense of any such
matter, (ii) Buyer Bank shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent and (iii) Buyer Bank shall have no
obligation to indemnify any DandO Indemnified Party if such indemnification
would be in violation of any applicable federal or state banking Laws or
regulations, or in the event that a federal or state banking agency or a court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of a DandO
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Laws and regulations, whether or not related to banking Laws.

 



 

(c) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Buyer will, and
cause Buyer Bank to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide
directorÂ’s and officerÂ’s liability insurance (herein, " _D andO Insurance_")
that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and directors of the
Bank or its Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to
claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or events
occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated
hereby), which insurance will contain at least the same coverage and amounts,
and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the DandO Indemnified
Party, as that coverage currently provided by the Bank; provided that if Buyer
Bank is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this _Section
5.21_, Buyer Bank will provide as much comparable insurance as is reasonably
available (subject to the limitations described below in this _Section
5.21(c)_); and provided, further, that officers and directors of the Bank or
its Subsidiaries may be required to make application and provide customary
representations and warranties to the carrier of the DandO Insurance for the
purpose of obtaining such insurance. In no event shall Buyer Bank be required
to expend for such tail insurance a premium amount in excess of an

 



      
 

 



 

amount equal to 200% of the annual premiums paid by the Bank for DandO Insurance
in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum D andO Tail
Premium_"). If the cost of such tail insurance exceeds the Maximum DandO Tail
Premium, Buyer Bank shall obtain tail insurance coverage or a separate tail
insurance policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
the Maximum DandO Tail Premium.

 



 

(d) If Buyer Bank or any of its successors and assigns (i) shall consolidate
with or merge into any other corporation, association or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its property and
assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Buyer Bank and its Subsidiaries shall assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 5.21_.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.21_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by each DandO Indemnified Party, and each DandO
Indemnified PartyÂ’s heirs and personal and legal representatives.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

 **TAX MATTERS**

 



 

Section 6.01. _Indemnification for and Allocation of and Procedures Regarding
Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting ParentÂ’s indemnification obligations under _Article
VIII_ hereof, Parent shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold the
Bank and the Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from, and shall pay to the
Bank and the Buyer Indemnified Parties the amount of, or reimburse the Bank
and the Buyer Indemnified Parties for, any Taxes that are not reflected in the
Bank Tangible Book Value (i) imposed on the Bank (or any Buyer Indemnified
Party as successor or transferee of the Bank) with respect to the assets or
business of the Bank for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date and for the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date ("
_Pre-Closing Tax Periods_ ") and (ii) (A) of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Bank is or was a member
on or prior to the Closing Date or (B) of any Person imposed on the Bank as a
transferee or successor, by operation of law or pursuant to any tax sharing,
tax indemnity, tax allocation or other similar agreement, which Taxes relate
to either a liability existing or to an event or transaction occurring on or
before the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Without limiting any of the indemnification obligations of Buyer under
_Article VIII_ hereof, Buyer shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and
hold the Parent Indemnified Parties harmless from, and shall pay to the Parent
Indemnified Parties the amount of, or reimburse the Parent Indemnified Parties
for (i) Taxes imposed on Parent or any Parent Indemnified Parties with respect
to the BankÂ’s or the Buyer BankÂ’s activities for any taxable period beginning
after the Closing Date and for the portion of any Straddle Period beginning
after the Closing Date and (ii) the obligation of Buyer for Taxes pursuant to
_Section 6.03_.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to any taxable period
that begins before and ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "),
such Taxes shall be apportioned between the period deemed to end on the
Closing Date and the period deemed to begin on the day following the Closing
Date on the basis of an interim closing of the books, except that Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or personal property Taxes) shall be
allocated on a daily basis. For purposes of this _Article VI_, any amounts
apportioned to the period deemed to end on the Closing Date shall be treated
as incurred in a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

(d) If ParentÂ’s obligation under _Section 6.01(a)_ arises in respect of an
adjustment that causes a correlative adjustment for the Bank or the Buyer
Bank, and the adjustment makes allowable to Buyer, any of its Affiliates or,
after the Closing Date, the Bank or the Buyer Bank, any Tax Benefit that would
not, but for any such adjustment, be allowable, then Buyer shall thereafter
pay to Seller for any subsequent tax year an amount equal to (A) the federal
and state income Tax liability for such tax year but for the realization of
such Tax Benefit, _minus_ (B) the actual federal and state Tax liability for
such tax year taking into account the realization of such Tax Benefit. Any
such payment pursuant to this _Section 6.01(d)_ shall be due and payable with
five (5) business days after the due date (without extensions) for filing
BuyerÂ’s Tax returns for such subsequent Tax years.

 



 

(e) Any indemnity or other payment made pursuant to this _Article VI_ shall
be treated by Parent and Buyer as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 



 

Section 6.02. _Filing of Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall include the income of the Bank on the federal income Tax
Return of Parent for all periods ending on or before the Closing Date and
shall pay any federal income Tax imposed on the Bank or Parent attributable to
such income as shown on such Tax Return. For all taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date, to the extent not already filed, Parent shall include
the income, gains, deductions and losses of the Bank in, and cause the Bank to
join in, the consolidated federal income Tax Return of Parent and, in
jurisdictions requiring separate reporting from the Bank, to file state and
local income Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed by
Parent in a manner reasonably consistent with past practice. At least 30 days
prior to the filing of any such separate-company Tax Return, Parent shall
provide Buyer with a copy of such Tax Return for BuyerÂ’s review and comment.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file (or cause to be
filed) all Tax Returns of the Bank and Buyer Bank for all taxable periods
other than those for which Parent is responsible pursuant to _Section
6.02(a)_ of this Agreement and shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes due for
such periods, provided however, that with respect to any such Tax Returns for
a Straddle Period, Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) such Tax
Returns in a manner reasonably consistent with past practice of the Bank. At
least 30 days prior to the filing of any such Tax Return with respect to a
Straddle Period, Buyer shall provide Parent with a copy of the Tax Return for
ParentÂ’s review and comment, and Buyer shall make any changes with respect to
Pre-Closing Tax Periods reasonably requested by Parent. Along with the copy of
such Tax Return with respect to a Straddle Period, Buyer shall provide Parent
with a statement calculating in reasonable detail any obligations of Parent
with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, if any, pursuant to _Section 6.01(a)_.
Buyer, the Bank and Parent agree that for federal income tax purposes the
BankÂ’s taxable year will end on the Closing Date and will treat the taxable
year as ending on such date in those jurisdictions where allowable under
applicable Law.

 



 

(c) After the Closing, with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Bank
(or any Subsidiary thereof), Buyer agrees not to, and agrees to cause its
Affiliates (including the Bank and the Buyer Bank and their Affiliates) not
to, (i) file any amended Tax Return, (ii) make or change any Tax election,
(iii) adopt or change any Tax accounting method, (iv) change any annual Tax
accounting period, (v) agree to extend any statute of limitations for Taxes,
(vi) settle any right to a Pre-Closing Tax Refund or other Tax benefit, (vii)
initiate any voluntary disclosure with respect to Taxes, or (viii) take any
other similar action relating to Taxes or Tax Returns. Buyer agrees not to,
and agrees to cause its Affiliates (including the Bank and the Buyer Bank and
their Affiliates) not to (i) make any election under Section 338 of the Code
(or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law) with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) take any action or enter into
any transaction on the Closing Date, after the Closing occurs, other than in
the ordinary course of business or as explicitly contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 6.03. _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including, without limitation, any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and any other similar Tax that may be
imposed, shall be paid by Buyer, and Buyer will file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by
applicable Law, Parent will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and
other documentation.

 



 

Section 6.04. _Procedures Relating to Tax Claims_.

 



 

(a) If Buyer, the Bank, the Buyer Bank, any Buyer Indemnified Parties or any
of their respective Affiliates receives notice of a pending audit of the Bank,
or if an assessment or written claim for Taxes shall be made by any
Governmental Authority, which audit, assessment or claim, if successful, might
result in a payment to Buyer pursuant to _Section 6.01(a)_ or _Article VIII_
for breach of any representation or warranty under _Section 3.19_ (a " _Tax
Claim_ "), Buyer or the Bank shall forward a copy of such Tax Claim to Parent
within ten (10) days of receipt of such Tax Claim. If Buyer or the Bank fails
to forward a copy of such Tax Claim within such period, Parent shall not be
liable to the Bank or the Buyer Indemnified Parties to the extent ParentÂ’s
position with respect to such Tax Claim is prejudiced as a result of such
failure.

 



 

(b) Parent shall have the right to participate with Buyer in any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding related to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, and to
employ counsel of its choice at its expense. Buyer agrees that it will
cooperate, and cause the Bank to cooperate, fully with Parent and ParentÂ’s
counsel in the defense against, and/or settlement of, any Tax Claim. Buyer
shall have the sole right to represent the Bank in any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding related to taxable periods beginning after
the Closing Date,

 



      
 

 



 

and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense. Parent agrees to
cooperate, at its expense, fully with Buyer and its counsel in the defense
against any claim in any said proceeding. Further, notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not agree to any settlement concerning Taxes for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, which settlement may
result in an increase in Taxes of the Bank for any taxable period ending after
the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Buyer, nor shall Buyer,
the Bank or Buyer Bank agree to any settlement concerning Taxes for any
taxable period ending after the Closing Date which may result in an increase
in Taxes of the Bank or Parent for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or in the case
of Parent any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, without the prior
written consent of Parent. Any consent required to be given under this Section
may not be unreasonably withheld.

 



 

(c) After the Closing Date, Parent and Buyer shall consult in good faith
during the course of any audits or administrative or judicial proceedings
pertaining to Taxes of, or which may affect, the Bank for Pre-Closing Tax
Periods or in the case of Parent any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period. Such consultations shall include, but not be limited to, consultations
concerning any ongoing or future audits related to any period or portion
thereof ending prior to or including the Closing Date and court proceedings
with respect thereto. Buyer or Parent, as the case may be, shall be made aware
of any meetings and conferences related thereto and have the right (to the
extent permissible by law) to have a representative present at those
conferences.

 



 

Section 6.05. _Cooperation, Exchange of Information and Record Retention_.
Each of the parties recognizes that the other parties and their respective
Affiliates will need access, from time to time, after the Closing Date, to
certain accounting and Tax records and information regarding Tax matters of
the Bank to the extent such records and information pertain to events
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date; therefore, from and after the
Closing Date, Parent and Buyer shall, and shall cause their Affiliates
(including, in the case of Buyer, the Bank and the Buyer Bank) to (i) retain
and maintain all records, including all Tax Returns, schedules and work
papers, books, records and other documents in its or their possession relating
to Tax matters of the Bank for each Pre-Closing Tax Period and for any
Straddle Period until expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable
periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate (giving effect to
any valid extensions requested by the other party and made known to the party
requesting such documentation) plus six (6) months, (ii) allow any other party
or parties (as appropriate) and its or their agents and representatives (and
agents or representatives of any Affiliates), upon reasonable notice and at
mutually convenient times, to inspect, review and make copies of such records
(at the expense of the party or parties requesting the records) as such party
or parties may deem reasonably necessary or appropriate from time to time,
(iii) execute any document (including any power of attorney) that may be
necessary or reasonably helpful in connection with any Tax Claim or the filing
of a Tax Return or refund with respect to the Bank or Parent and (iv) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Tax Returns, schedules and work
papers, books, records and other documents and provide additional facts,
insights or views as reasonably requested by the other party or parties, in
each case, that may be necessary or helpful in connection with any Tax Returns
or Tax Claims of the Bank or Parent. Buyer shall cause the Bank to provide
Parent with written notice ninety (90) days prior to transferring, destroying
or discarding the last copy of any records, books, work papers, reports,
correspondence and

 



      
 

 



 

other similar materials, and Parent shall have the right, at their expense, to
copy or take any such materials. Any information obtained under this _Section
6.05_ shall be kept confidential except as may be otherwise necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in
conducting an audit or other proceeding.

 



 

Section 6.06. _Survival of Tax Provisions_. Any claim to be made pursuant to
this _Article VI_ must be made before the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (giving effect to any valid extensions) relating to the
Taxes at issue plus 60 days.

 



 

Section 6.07. _Other Tax Provisions_.

 



 

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms or the
Closing Date, neither the Bank nor Parent shall make any material election not
consistent with past practices or make a material change in any existing
election in respect of Taxes, adopt or change any accounting method in respect
of Taxes, except as required by law, enter into any closing agreement, settle
any claim or assessment in respect of Taxes (except settlements effected
solely through payment of immaterial sums of money), or consent to any
extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any claim or
assessment in respect of Taxes.

 



 

(b) Parent shall make available for BuyerÂ’s inspection, as reasonably
requested, copies of those federal, state, county, local and foreign Tax
Returns, reports and estimates for periods on or prior to the Closing Date for
the Bank to the extent not previously provided to Buyer.

 



 

(c) Parent shall cause any and all Tax allocation or sharing agreements
(including any indemnity arrangements) or similar agreements or arrangements
(collectively " _Tax Sharing Agreements_ ") to which the Bank is a party or is
otherwise subject to be terminated effective as of the Closing Date, and any
payment, liability or other obligation with respect to any such Tax Sharing
Agreements shall be paid or satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date, except
for those Tax Sharing Agreements for which payment is not yet due as of the
Closing Date, the payment of which Parent shall be responsible in accordance
with _Section 6.01_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Bank (and Buyer Bank, as successor) shall remain responsible
for paying any Tax amounts that are included as liabilities in the
determination of Bank Tangible Book Value as of the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 6.08. _Refund Claims_. Except as otherwise provided herein, Parent
shall be entitled to receive from Buyer all refunds (or credits for
overpayments actually realized by Buyer) of Taxes, including any interest
thereon received from any Governmental Authority, attributable to Pre-Closing
Tax Periods to the extent not included in the Bank Tangible Book Value (a "
_Pre-Closing Tax Refund_ "). Promptly upon receipt of any such Tax refund (or
credits for overpayment actually realized by Buyer, the Bank or Buyer Bank),
and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt by Buyer,
Buyer will, and will cause the Bank to, deliver and pay over, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, such Tax refunds (or credits for overpayments
actually realized by Buyer, the Bank or Buyer Bank), including any interest
thereon received from any Governmental Authority, less any reasonable fees and
expenses Buyer incurs for obtaining such refund, to Parent. Buyer shall, as
soon as is

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably practicable and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after
a reasonable request by Parent, cause the Bank or Buyer Bank to file, at
ParentÂ’s expense, amended Tax Returns or applications for Tax refunds in order
to obtain a Tax refund (or credit for overpayment actually realized by Buyer,
the Bank or Buyer Bank) that Parent is entitled to pursuant to this _Section
6.08_, and Buyer shall execute all other documents, take reasonable additional
actions and otherwise reasonably cooperate as may be necessary for Buyer to
perfect its rights in and obtain the Tax refunds contemplated by this _Section
6.08_. Parent shall not be obligated to file for any refunds of Taxes due to a
carry back of any loss or credits incurred by the Bank or Buyer Bank post
Closing.

 



 

Section 6.09. _Certain Tax Attributes_. Any tax loss or tax credit of the
Bank, the economic benefit of which is realized in a period ending after the
Closing Date, shall be for the account of Buyer, and Buyer shall not be
obligated to pay any additional consideration to Parent therefor. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, this Section applies to any tax loss
or credit generated in any period ending after the Closing Date.

" _Claim Information_ "), and shall provide any other information with respect
thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to
provide such notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this _Article VIII_ except to the extent that
the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s ability to remedy, contest, defend or settle a claim
is prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

(b) With respect to Third Party Claims, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense
thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party;
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party may only elect to assume and
control the defense thereof so long as (A) the Indemnifying Party is not a
party to the Third Party Claim or the Indemnified Party has determined in good
faith

 



      
 

 



 

that there would be no conflict of interest or other inappropriate matter
associated with joint representation, (B) the Third Party Claim involves only
money damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief and
(C) the Indemnifying Party keeps the Indemnified Party apprised of all
developments, including settlement offers, with respect to the Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel
and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party; provided, however,
that the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and
expenses of one counsel to such Indemnified Party in connection with such
defense to the extent (x) the employment of such counsel and payment of fees
and expenses thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying
Party in writing, (y) the fees and expenses relate to the period prior to the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s assumption of defense, or (z) the Indemnified Party
provides written notice that any condition to the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s control
of the Third Party Claims in _Sections 8.04(b)(A) Â— (C)_ above becomes
unsatisfied and the lack of satisfaction of such condition has not been cured
within thirty (30) days following delivery of such written notice, in which
case the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for such reasonable fees and
expenses accruing from the expiration of such thirty (30) day period. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, pertinent records,
materials and information in the Indemnified PartyÂ’s possession or under the
Indemnified PartyÂ’s control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement, compromise
or discharge of such Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party may
recommend and that by its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the
full amount of the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim, and
which releases the Indemnified Party completely in connection with such Third
Party Claim; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any
other settlement of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Regardless of which party assumes the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, or offer to settle, compromise
or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 



 

(c) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim being
asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim containing the Claim
Information promptly to the Indemnifying Party, and shall provide any other
information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request. The failure to provide such notice, however, shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this _Article VIII_
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such
failure. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist the
Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by
the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance
and cooperation shall include providing reasonable access to and copies of
information, records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing
employees to assist in the

 



      
 

 



 

investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and
business assistance with respect to such matters.

 



 

Section 8.05. _Limits on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

 



 

(i) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered
from Parent by Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 8.02(a)_, or
from the Buyer by the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section
8.03(a)_, shall be $5,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "); provided that the Cap and the
one-year limit on indemnification provided for in _Section 8.02(a)_ shall not
apply in respect of Losses resulting from fraud in this Agreement, in which
case the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be
recovered shall be the Purchase Price;

 



 

(ii) Parent shall not be liable to any Buyer Indemnified Party, and the Buyer
shall not be liable to any Parent Indemnified Party, for any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.02(a) or Section 8.03(a) unless and
until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from
Parent or the Buyer, as applicable, equals or exceeds $500,000 (the " _Basket
Amount_ "), in which case Parent or the Buyer, as applicable, shall be liable
only for the Losses in excess of the Basket Amount; provided that the Basket
Amount shall not apply in respect of Losses resulting from fraud in this
Agreement; and

 



 

(iii) no party hereto shall have any liability under any provision of this
Agreement for any punitive, special or exemplary damages, damages that do not
arise directly and naturally from the breach of this Agreement or damages that
are not a reasonably foreseeable result of a breach of this Agreement, except
to the extent such damages are awarded in connection with a Third Party Claim.

 



 

(b) The amount of any and all Losses under this _Article VIII_ shall be
determined net of any insurance proceeds actually recovered by the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates on account of such Loss (net of the costs of obtaining
such insurance proceeds, including any deductible or increase in premiums) and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any and all Losses
under this _Article VIII_ and any and all indemnifiable Taxes under Section
6.01 shall be determined net of any Tax savings realized or reasonably
expected to be realized as a result of such Loss or Tax by the Indemnified
Party. Each party hereby waives, to the extent permitted under its applicable
insurance policies, any subrogation rights that its insurer may have with
respect to any indemnifiable Losses.

 



 

(c) Buyer and Parent shall, or shall cause the applicable Indemnified Party
to, mitigate all Losses for which such Indemnified Party is or may be entitled
to indemnification hereunder to the extent required by applicable Law in
connection with a breach of contract. The Buyer and Parent shall, or shall
cause the applicable Indemnified Party to, use reasonable efforts to seek full
recovery under all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as
they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) For purposes of determining the amount of any Loss for all purposes under
this _Article VIII_, but not for purposes of determining whether a breach of
a representation and warranty has occurred, each representation and warranty
contained in this Agreement shall be read without regard to any "materiality"
or "Material Adverse Effect" qualifier contained therein.

 



 

Section 8.06. _Assignment of Claims_. If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Losses pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part
of such Losses from a third party (a " _Potential Contributor_ ") based on the
underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential
Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from
the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.

 



 

Section 8.07. _Exclusivity_. Except for (i) injunctive action or other
equitable remedies or (ii) as a result of fraud in this Agreement, the
remedies provided in this _Article VIII_ shall be the exclusive remedies of
the parties after the Closing in respect of any matter arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.08. _Knowledge_. The right to indemnification or other remedy under
this Agreement based on the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation
conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) at any time by any party, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy or
inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX**

 



 

 **TERMINATION**

 



 

Section 9.01. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned:

 



 

(a) _Mutual Consent_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by the mutual
consent, in writing, of Buyer and Parent, if a majority of the board of
directors of each of Buyer and Parent each so determines.

 



 

(b) _No Regulatory Approval_. By Buyer or Parent in the event any Regulatory
Approval required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall have been denied by final, non-appealable action by such
Governmental Authority or an application therefor shall have been permanently
withdrawn at the request of a Governmental Authority.

 



 

(c) _Breach of Representations and Warranties_. By either Buyer or Parent
(provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein in a
manner that would entitle the other party to not consummate this Agreement) if
there shall have been (i) with respect to representations

 



      
 

 



 

and warranties set forth in this Agreement that are not qualified by the term
"material" or do not contain terms such as "Material Adverse Effect", a
material breach of any of such representations or warranties by the other
party and (ii) with respect to representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement that are qualified by the term "material" or contain terms such
as "Material Adverse Effect", any breach of any of such representations or
warranties by the other party; which breach is not cured prior to the earlier
of (y) thirty (30) days following written notice to the party committing such
breach from the other party hereto or (z) two (2) Business Days prior to the
Expiration Date, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the
Closing.

 



 

(d) _Breach of Covenants_. By either Buyer or Parent (provided that the
terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein in a manner that would
entitle the other party not to consummate the agreement) if there shall have
been a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the other party, which breach shall not have been
cured prior to the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days following written notice to
the party committing such breach from the other party hereto or (ii) two (2)
Business Days prior to the Expiration Date, or which breach, by its nature,
cannot be cured prior to the Closing.

 



 

(e) _Delay_. It being understood that the parties shall use good faith efforts
to submit regulatory filings in a timely manner, by Buyer or Parent if the
Stock Sale shall not have been consummated on or before August 1, 2016,
provided that such date may be extended by 90 days by Buyer or Parent by
written notice to the other party if the only reason the Closing shall not
have occurred is because of failure to obtain a Regulatory Approval (the "
_Expiration Date_ "); provided further, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 9.01(e) shall not be available to any party whose
action or failure to act has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of
the Closing to occur on or before such date and such action or failure to act
constitutes a breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(f) _Superior Proposal_. By Parent, if at any time within 30 days following
the date of this Agreement, Parent or the Bank receives an Acquisition
Proposal; provided, however, that Parent shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the foregoing clause unless: (i) Parent shall have complied in all
material respects with _Section 5.07_ of this Agreement, including the
conclusion by the Parent Board in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal is
a Superior Proposal; (ii) Parent concurrently pays the Termination Fee to
Buyer payable pursuant to _Section 9.02_ of this Agreement; and (iii) the
Parent Board concurrently approves, and Parent, the Bank or either of them
concurrently enters into, a definitive agreement with respect such Superior
Proposal.

 



 

(g) _Breach of Section 5.07_. By Buyer, if at any time within 30 days
following the date of this Agreement, Parent shall have materially breached
its obligations under _Section 5.07_ of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.02. _Termination Fee_.

 



 

(a) In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities foregone
by Buyer while structuring and pursuing the Stock Sale, in the event that (i)
the Agreement is

 



      
 

 



 

terminated by Buyer pursuant to _Section 9.01(g)_ of the Agreement or (ii)
the Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.01(f)_ of the
Agreement, then Parent shall pay to Buyer a termination fee equal to
$4,200,000 (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of immediately available
funds within two (2) Business Days after receipt of BuyerÂ’s notification of
such termination.

 



 

(b) In the event that (i) an Acquisition Proposal, whether or not conditional,
shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to Parent after
the date hereof (or any Person shall have, after the date hereof, publicly
announced or otherwise communicated to Parent an intention, whether or not
conditional, to make an Acquisition Proposal), (ii) this Agreement is
thereafter terminated by Buyer pursuant to _Section 9.01(c)_ or _Section
9.01(d)_ as a result of ParentÂ’s willful breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants hereunder, or pursuant to _Section 9.01(e)_, and
(iii) within 12 months following the date of such termination, Parent enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Transaction, the
board of directors of Parent recommends any Acquisition Transaction or Parent
consummates any Acquisition Transaction (whether or not such Acquisition
Transaction resulted from or was related to the Acquisition Proposal referred
to in the foregoing clause (i), if applicable), then Parent shall pay Buyer
the Termination Fee, which amount shall be payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds on or prior to the earlier of Parent entering into
a definitive agreement for or consummating such Acquisition Transaction.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that if Parent pays or causes to be paid the Termination Fee in
accordance with _Section 9.02(a)_ and _Section 9.02(b)_, then Parent, the
Bank and their Affiliates will not have any further obligations or liabilities
to Buyer with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.03. _Effect of Termination_. Except as set forth in _Section
9.02(c)_, termination of this Agreement will not relieve a breaching party
from liability for any breach of any covenant, agreement, representation or
warranty of this Agreement giving rise to such termination.

 



 

 **ARTICLE X**

 



 

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

Section 10.01. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with or related to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
fees or expenses, whether or not such transactions are consummated. In the
event of termination of this Agreement, the obligation of each party to pay
its own expenses will be subject to any rights of such party arising from a
breach of this Agreement by the other. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties
acknowledge that any expenses to be borne by the Bank in this Agreement will

Section 10.03. _Waiver_. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any
right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of
conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or power. Any agreement on the part of any party to any such
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument executed and
delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf of such party.

hereunder to a party, shall be in writing and shall be deemed properly given
