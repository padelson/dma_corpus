 SECTION 8.2. Indemnification Coverage. 

   

 (a) From and after the Closing, each Selling Party (the "Indemnifying Parties") shall severally but not jointly indemnify and defend, save and hold Buyer harmless if Buyer shall actually incur any damage, judgment, fine, penalty, demand, settlement, liability, loss, cost, Tax, expense (including reasonable attorneys, consultants and experts fees), claim or cause of action (each, a "Loss," and collectively, "Losses") arising out of, relating to or resulting from (i) any breach or inaccuracy in any representation by the General Partner or the breach of any warranty by the General Partner contained in _Section 2.2_ of this Agreement; (ii) any breach or inaccuracy in any representation by such Selling Party contained in _Section 2.1_ of this Agreement; or (iii) any breach of the covenants and agreements by such Selling Party under this Agreement; _provided_ , that in determining whether any representation or warranty has been breached or is inaccurate, such representation or warranty shall be construed as if Material Adverse Effect or materiality is not a qualification thereto. 

  

 (b) The foregoing indemnification obligations shall be subject to the following limitations: 

  

 (i) each Indemnifying Partys aggregate liability (A) under  _Section 8.2(a)(i)_, except with respect to a breach of _Section 2.2(d)(iii)_, shall not exceed such Indemnifying Partys allocated portion of $12,338,597 set forth on _Schedule 1.3_ to such Indemnifying Partys sale of a GP Interest and (B) under _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (with respect to a breach of Section 2.2(d)(iii) only), _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_ or _8.2(a)(iii)_ shall not exceed the total Purchase Price allocated on _Schedule 1.3_ to be paid to such Indemnifying Party; 

  

 (ii) any claims made pursuant to (A) _Section 8.2(a)(i)_, except with respect to a breach of _Section 2.2(d)_, must be made by Buyer within six months from the date of this Agreement and (B) pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (with respect to a breach of _Section 2.2(d)_ only), _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_ or _8.2(a)(iii)_ must be made by Buyer within the survival period specified in 

   ##### 

  

 

 _Section 8.1_ for the representation or other provision which the Buyer is
alleging has been breached; 

   

 (iii) the amount of any Losses suffered by Buyer shall be reduced by any third-party insurance or other indemnification payments which such party receives in respect of or as a result of such Losses, less the reasonable costs incurred to recover those insurance or indemnification payments to the extent such costs are not otherwise recovered. If any Losses for which indemnification is provided hereunder is subsequently reduced by any third-party insurance or other indemnification payments received by the Buyer less the reasonable costs incurred to obtain payment, the amount of the reduction shall be remitted pro rata to the Selling Parties who have made payment hereunder; 

  

 (iv) no claim may be asserted nor may any action be commenced against any party for breach or inaccuracy of any representation or breach of a warranty, unless written notice of such claim or action is received by the other party describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or action on or prior to the date on which the representation or warranty on which such claim or action is based ceases to survive as set forth in  _Section 8.1_; 

  

 (v) Buyer shall not be entitled under this Agreement to multiple recovery for the same Losses. 

  

 SECTION 8.3. Procedures. 

   

 (a) Buyer shall notify the Indemnifying Party (with reasonable detail) promptly (but in each case within 10 business days) after it becomes aware of facts supporting a claim or action for indemnification under this _Article VIII_, and shall provide to the Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable thereafter all reasonable available information and documentation necessary to support and verify any Losses associated with such claim or action. Subject to _Section 8.2(c)(iv)_ , the failure to so notify or provide information to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to Buyer, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced by Buyers failure to give such notice, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved from its obligations hereunder to the extent of such material prejudice. The Indemnifying Party shall participate in and defend, contest or otherwise protect Buyer against any such claim or action by counsel of the Indemnifying Partys choice at its sole cost and expense; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not make any settlement or compromise without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, there is no admission or statement of fault or culpability on the part of Buyer and there is an unconditional release of Buyer from all liability on any claims that are the subject of such claim or action. Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate at its own expense in the defense thereof by counsel of Buyers choice and shall in any event use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying Party; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees and expenses of separate counsel for Buyer if (i) the Indemnifying Party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) counsel for the Indemnifying Party reasonably determines that representation of both the Indemnifying Party and Buyer by the 

   ##### 

  

    

same counsel would create a conflict of interest. If the Indemnifying Party
fails timely to defend, contest or otherwise protect against such suit,
action, investigation, claim or proceeding, Buyer shall have the right to do
so, including, without limitation, the right to make any compromise or
settlement thereof, and Buyer shall be entitled to recover the entire
cost thereof from the Indemnifying Party, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys fees, disbursements and amounts paid as the result of
such suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding. 

  

 SECTION 8.4. Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Each party, to the extent permitted by applicable law, agrees to treat any payments made pursuant to this _Article VIII_ as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all federal and state income and franchise Tax purposes. To the extent that any such payment is not permitted to be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, the amount of such payment shall be increased so that after reduction for the amount of any actual additional Tax cost incurred as a result of the receipt of such payment, the amount remaining will be equal to the amount of the payment that is owed under this _Article VIII_. 

   

 SECTION 8.5. Remedies. 

   

 (a) The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of _Article VIII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Buyer for any breach by any Selling Party or the General Partner of the representations and warranties in this Agreement, or any certificate delivered in connection herewith, and for any failure by the Selling Parties or the General Partner to perform and comply with any covenants and agreements in this Agreement, except that if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their terms or are otherwise breached, the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms thereof in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. Each party hereto shall take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses. 

  

 (b) No Selling Party nor the General Partner shall have any liability under any provision of this Agreement for any punitive or exemplary damages relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or any representations or warranties contained herein or in any certificate delivered in connection herewith. 

  

 (c) The provisions of this _Section 8.5_ do not apply to nor restrict the remedies of the Buyer with respect to any representations or warranties of ETE contained in the certificate to be delivered to the Buyer by ETE pursuant to _Section 5.7_. 

  

 (d) The Buyer and the Selling Parties agree that (i) the General Partner shall have no liability under this Agreement to the Buyer or any Selling Party, for the breach of any representations or warranty contained in _Section 2.2_, covenant or otherwise, except with respect to the covenants set forth in _Section 1.01(a)(ii)_, _Section 1.01(a)(iii)_ and  _Section 1.2(d)(i)_, and (ii) the Selling Parties shall be solely responsible to indemnify the Buyer for any breach of any representation or warranty of the General Partner under this Agreement, in accordance with this _Article VIII_.

 SECTION 9.7. Severability.
