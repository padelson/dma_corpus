Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holders of any of the following securities:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Common Stock; Merger Consideration_. Each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Common Stock_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
_Share_ ") (other than (i) Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub and Shares
owned by the Company, including Shares held in treasury by the Company, and in
each case not held on behalf of third parties (collectively, the " _Cancelled

Shares owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
or Parent (which shares shall be converted into shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, except that the number of
such Shares owned by such subsidiaries may be adjusted following the Merger to
maintain the value of such Shares held by such subsidiaries (the " _Subsidiary
Shares_ ")) shall be converted into the right to receive $33.15 per Share in
cash, without interest (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). From and
after the Effective Time, each of the Shares that has been converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration shall automatically cease
to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each (x)
certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, any of the Shares (other than Cancelled Shares, Subsidiary
Shares and Dissenting Shares) and (y) non-certificated Share held in book-
entry form representing any such Share (other than Cancelled Shares,
Subsidiary Shares and Dissenting Shares) (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Cancelled Shares_. Each Cancelled Share shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration in
exchange therefor and shall cease to exist.

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of

shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation, except for those shares which shall remain outstanding pursuant
to clause (iii) of _Section 2.1(a)_, if any.

 



     

 

 



 

SECTION 2.2 _Treatment of Options, PSUs, RSUs and Restricted Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Options_.

 



 

(i) At the Effective Time, each Option with a per share exercise price less
than the Per Share Merger Consideration that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested (each, a " _Cash-Out Option_
"), shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, become fully vested and shall be cancelled and thereafter
entitle the holder of such Cash-Out Option to receive an amount in cash equal
to the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the
Cash-Out Option __multiplied__ by (y) the excess of the Per Share Merger
Consideration over the per-share exercise price of such Cash-Out Option.

 



 

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Option with a per share exercise price equal
to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled without any consideration paid to the holder thereof.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of PSUs_. At the Effective Time, each PSU Award outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested and
shall be cancelled and thereafter entitle the holder of such PSU Award to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of
Common Stock equal to the greater of (i) the target number of shares of Common
Stock with respect to such PSU Award as defined and set forth in such PSU
Award and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock that would be considered
earned under the terms of such PSU Award based on the most recent fiscal year-
end results of the Company preceding the fiscal year during which the
Effective Time occurs __multiplied__ by (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(c) _Treatment of RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each RSU Award outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested and
shall be cancelled and thereafter entitle the holder of such RSU Award to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of
Common Stock subject to such RSU Award __multiplied__ by (y) the Per Share
Merger Consideration.

 



 

(d) _Treatment of Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, each Restricted
Share Award outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, become fully vested and shall be cancelled and thereafter entitle the

the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such
Restricted Share Award __multiplied__ by (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(e) _Payment; Taxes_. The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holders of Cash-Out Options, PSU
Awards, RSU Awards and Restricted Share Awards the cash payments described in
this _Section 2.2_ on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, but in any event within five Business Days following the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that no payment shall be accelerated to
the extent it would result in the incurrence of a penalty tax under Section
409A of the Code, and instead, any such payment shall be made on the earliest
date possible without incurring any such

 



     

 

 



 

penalty tax. All payments described in this _Section 2.2_ shall be made after
giving effect to applicable withholding requirements as provided in _Section
2.3(e)_.

 



 

(f) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt all resolutions and take any actions which are
necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 2.2_. As of the
Effective Time, each holder of an Option, PSU Award or RSU Award or Restricted
Share Award (collectively the " _Outstanding Equity Awards_ ") shall cease to
have any rights with respect to shares of Common Stock. The Company shall take
all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver
shares of Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any Person
pursuant to or in settlement of any Outstanding Equity Awards.

 



 

SECTION 2.3 _Surrender of Shares; Payment_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall
enter into an agreement with a paying agent selected by Parent, and approved
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) in
advance by the Company, to act as agent for the stockholders of the Company in
connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive payment of the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to which the stockholders of the
Company shall become entitled pursuant to this _Article II_. At or prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Paying Agent a cash amount in immediately available funds sufficient in the
aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make all
payments in respect of Shares (other than Cancelled Shares, Dissenting Shares
or Subsidiary Shares) under _Section 2.1(a)_ (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") in trust for the benefit of the
holders of the Shares. With respect to any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall not
be required to deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent funds
sufficient to pay the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of
such Dissenting Shares. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments (i) shall not relieve
Parent from making any payments required by this Agreement, (ii) shall not
have a maturity that could prevent or delay any payments to be made pursuant
to this Agreement, and (iii) shall be in short-term obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Financial Services LLC, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $5 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time
of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing. Subject to _Section
2.3(c)_, to the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments,
or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to
make prompt cash payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration as
contemplated hereby, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through
such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at
all applicable times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash
payments, and Parent (and, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable in respect of
Shares under _Section 2.1(a)_ shall be promptly returned to Parent or

 



     

 

 



 

the Surviving Corporation, as requested by Parent. The funds deposited with
the Paying Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.3(a)_ shall not be used for any
purpose other than as contemplated by this _Section 2.3(a)_. Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all charges and expenses (other
than Taxes and charges and expenses resulting from lost Certificates),
including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares
for the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Transmittal Materials_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than three (3) Business Days after the Closing Date), Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise provide to each holder of record
of Shares (other than holders of Cancelled Shares, Dissenting Shares or
Subsidiary Shares) (A) transmittal materials, including a letter of
transmittal in customary form as agreed by the Parties, specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, with
respect to Book-Entry Shares, only upon delivery of an "agents message"
regarding the book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares (or such other
evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request),
and with respect to Certificates, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section
2.3(f)_) to the Paying Agent, such transmittal materials to be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree,
and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Book-Entry Shares or
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in
_Section 2.3(f)_) to the Paying Agent.

 



 

(ii) _Certificates_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section 2.3(f)_) to the Paying Agent
in accordance with the terms of such transmittal materials and instructions,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, and Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in
exchange therefor as promptly as reasonably practicable, a cash amount in
immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.3(e)_) equal to the product obtained
by __multiplying__ (A) the number of Shares previously represented by such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in
_Section 2.3(f)_) by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the
Certificate of such holder so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates.

 



 

(iii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent
to receive the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive as a result of the Merger pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_.
In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares (other
than Cancelled Shares, Dissenting Shares and Subsidiary Shares) shall upon
receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in customary form (it
being understood that the holders of Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have
surrendered such Shares upon receipt by the Paying Agent of such

 



     

 

 



 

"agents message" or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (and in no event more than three (3) Business Days thereafter),
a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.3(e)_) equal to the
product obtained by __multiplying__ (A) the number of Shares previously
represented by such Book-Entry Shares by (B) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(iv) _Unrecorded Transfers; Other Payments_. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company or if payment of the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration is to
be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, a check for any cash to be
exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share may be
issued to such transferee or other Person if the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent
accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer or other similar Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable.

 



 

(v) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.3(b)_, each
Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
(together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions (as applicable)) the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article
II_.

 



 

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto and the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company
for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation or its designee(s). Any holder of Shares (other than
Cancelled Shares, Dissenting Shares or Subsidiary Shares) who has not
theretofore exchanged Shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Article II_ shall thereafter be entitled to look to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section
2.3(e)_) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of the Certificates) or acceptable evidence of Book-Entry Shares, without any
interest thereon in accordance with the provisions set forth in _Section
2.3(b)_, and Parent shall remain liable for (subject to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) payment of their claim for the Per
Share Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or
Book-Entry Share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall
be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the close of business on the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or acceptable
evidence of a Book-Entry Share is presented to the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged
for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof
is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_. The Per Share Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender of Certificates (or upon receipt by the Paying Agent
of an "agents message," in the case of Book-Entry Shares) in accordance with
the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and any
applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such Taxes as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or under
any other applicable provision of Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Entity, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

(f) _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount
and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by Parent as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the
amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section 2.3(e)_) equal to the product obtained by __multiplying__ (i) the
number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate by
(ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 



 

SECTION 2.4 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any Shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and as to which the holders thereof
have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and
who shall have properly demanded appraisal in writing in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL and have not effectively withdrawn such demand
(collectively, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
2.1(a)_, unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
such Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL, at which time such Shares
shall be treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable
for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_, without interest and after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_
and such Shares shall not be deemed Dissenting Shares, and such holder thereof
shall cease to have any other rights with respect to such Shares. From and
after the Effective Time, each holder of Dissenting Shares shall only be
entitled to such consideration as may be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of any demands for appraisal, withdrawals of such demands, and

 



     

 

 



 

any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by
the Company or any of its Representatives relating to stockholders rights of
appraisal, and Parent shall be entitled to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle
any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, except as
required by applicable Law.

 



 

SECTION 2.5 _Adjustments_. In the event that the number of Shares or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued
and outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time shall
have been changed into a different number of Shares or securities or a
different class as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall
be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Shares the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.5_ shall be construed to permit
the Company, any subsidiary of the Company or any other Person to take any
action that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

Except (a) as disclosed in all forms, reports, statements, certifications and
other documents (including all exhibits and other information incorporated
therein, amendments and supplements thereto) in each case required to be filed
or furnished by it with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ ") (collectively, the " _SEC Documents_ ") and publicly available no
less than one (1) Business Day prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding
any risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors" (other
than factual information contained therein) or in any other section to the

or similarly predictive or forward-looking in nature (other than factual
information contained therein)) (it being understood that this sub-clause (a)
shall not be applicable to the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 3.3(a)_, _Section 3.3(b)_, the first two sentences of _Section
3.4_ and _Section 3.23_) or (b) as set forth in the corresponding sections or
subsections of the disclosure schedules delivered to Parent by the Company
concurrently with entering into this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Schedule_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or
subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall also be deemed disclosure

relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on its face), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

in good standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or

 



     

 

 



 

operation of its assets or properties or present conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except in each case where the failure to be so
qualified or, to the extent such concept is applicable, in good standing, or
to have such power or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. _Section 3.1_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement,
(a) each of the Companys subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the
Company in each such subsidiary, as well as the ownership interest of any
other Person or Persons in each such subsidiary and the jurisdiction of

heretofore made available to Parent in the Data Room a correct and complete

certificates and other documents filed since the Applicable Date, and those
filed or furnished subsequent to the date hereof, including all exhibits and

collectively, the " _SEC Reports_ "). As of their respective filing dates, or,
if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing made prior to the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing

in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), the Exchange Act and the

(or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such
amendment), none of the SEC Reports so filed contained, when filed, any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make

consolidated financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries at the
respective dates thereof (taking into account the notes thereto) and the

Act is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible
for the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and other public
disclosure documents. Such internal control over financial reporting is

process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting,
and in each case the Company has made available to Parent (or its
Representatives), or otherwise provided as an SEC Document, prior to the date
of this Agreement all such disclosures from the Applicable Date to the date of
this Agreement. The terms "significant deficiencies" and "material weaknesses"
have the meanings assigned to such terms in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.

its subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required by GAAP to
be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto), other than those which would not,

Adverse Effect.

Parent and Merger Sub each hereby represents and warrants to the Company that,
except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the

concurrently with entering into this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure

duly organized, validly existing and, to the extent such concept is

concept is applicable, is in good standing as a foreign corporation or other
legal entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of
its assets or properties or present conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except in each case where the failure to be so qualified or, to
the extent such concept is applicable, in good standing, or to have such power
or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent has made available to the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement a complete and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation and

State of Delaware of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL). This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of Parent

delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
Parent or Merger Sub.

Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation of the Merger and the other

attorneys, investment bankers and other advisors or representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of the Company and its subsidiaries not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly induce or
encourage or otherwise knowingly facilitate (including by providing
information) any inquiries with respect to, or the making of, any Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry, offer or proposal that could reasonably be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise
participate in any negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide access
to its properties, books and records or any confidential or non-public
information or data to, any Person for the purpose of encouraging or

could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may (x) notify such Person of
the existence of this _Section 6.1_, and (y) in response to a _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof that was not initiated, solicited,
knowingly encouraged or facilitated in, and did not otherwise result from a,

Proposal and the likelihood and timing of consummation thereof), (iii)
approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or

any of the foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of any of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by
any Representatives of the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed
to be a breach of this _Section 6.1(a)_ by the Company. The Company shall,
shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, and shall instruct (and use its
reasonable efforts to cause) its Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any
Person (other than the Parties and their respective Representatives) in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal. The Company also agrees that it will
promptly request each Person (other than the Parties and their respective
Representatives) that has, prior to the date hereof, executed a
confidentiality agreement in

 



     

 

 



 

connection with its consideration of an Acquisition Proposal to promptly
return or destroy all confidential information furnished to such Person by or

discussions or negotiations with the Company or any of its Representatives, in
each case in writing and relating to an Acquisition Proposal, which notice
shall include a summary of the material terms and conditions of, and the
identity of the Person making, such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or
offer, and copies of any such written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements, and thereafter shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed,

occurrence of any changes, developments, discussions or negotiations), of any
material developments regarding any Acquisition Proposals or any material
change to the terms and status of any such Acquisition Proposal and (ii)
provide to Parent as soon as practicable (and in any event within 48 hours)
after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other
written material sent or provided to the Company or any of its subsidiaries
from any person that describes any of the terms or conditions of any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its
subsidiaries shall terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any provision of
any existing standstill or similar agreement to which it or one of its
subsidiaries is a party, except that prior to, but not after, obtaining the
Company Requisite Vote, if after consultation with, and taking into account
the advice of, outside legal counsel, the Company Board determines that the
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a
violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may waive
any such standstill provision solely to the extent necessary to permit a third
party to make, on a confidential basis, to the Company Board, an Acquisition
Proposal.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
contained herein shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from:

 



 

(i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a
tender offer or exchange offer, in each case, to the extent legally required)
or from making any other disclosure to stockholders with regard to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal if the
Company Board determines in good faith that the failure to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law ( _provided_ , that neither the Company nor the Company Board may
recommend any Acquisition Proposal unless expressly permitted by _Section
6.1(c)_ or _Section 6.3_, and _provided_ , _further_ , that any such
disclosure that has the substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely
modifying the Recommendation shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation
and any such disclosure that relates to an Acquisition Proposal, shall be
deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the Company in connection with
such disclosure publicly and expressly reaffirms the Recommendation);
_provided_ , _further_ , that the issuance by the Company or the Company Board
of a "stop, look and listen" communication as contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to its
stockholders) in which the Company provides only a factually accurate public
statement that the Company has received an

 



     

 

 



 

Acquisition Proposal and states that the Company Board has not changed the
Recommendation shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation;

 



 

(ii) prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, providing
access to its properties, books and records and providing any information or
data in response to a request therefor by a Person or group who has made a
_bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal that was made after the date hereof and was
not initiated, solicited, or knowingly encouraged or facilitated in violation
of _Section 6.1_, if the Company Board (A) shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its
outside legal counsel and Financial Advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal
could reasonably be expected to constitute or result in a Superior Proposal,
(B) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with, and taking
into account the advice of, its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (C) has received from the Person so requesting such
information an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ ,
that any such access, information or data has previously been provided to
Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with
the time such access, information or data is provided to such Person or group;

 



 

(iii) prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, engaging
in any negotiations or discussions with any Person and its Representatives who
has made a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal that was made after the date
hereof and was not initiated, solicited, or knowingly encouraged or
facilitated in violation of _Section 6.1_ or any other violation of this
Agreement, if the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside legal
counsel and Financial Advisor, that (A) such Acquisition Proposal could
reasonably be expected to constitute or result in a Superior Proposal and (B)
the failure to engage in any such negotiations or discussions would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; or

 



 

(iv) prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, making a
Change of Recommendation (but only if permitted by _Section 6.1(c)_ or
_Section 6.3_).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any
time prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with, and taking
into account the advice of, its Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel,
in response to a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal that was made after the date
hereof and was not initiated, solicited, or knowingly encouraged or
facilitated in violation of _Section 6.1_ and such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal (taking into account any adjustment to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement committed to by Parent and Merger Sub
in response to such Acquisition Proposal) and the failure to take the action
in sub-clause (i) or (ii) below would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, the Company or the Company Board may (and may
resolve or agree to) (i) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_ and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal or (ii) effect a Change of Recommendation in accordance with
clause (x)(A) of _Section 6.3_; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Company
terminates the

 



     

 

 



 

Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, the Company pays to Parent the
Company Termination Fee required to be paid pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)(i)_
concurrently with or prior to such termination; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the Company will not be entitled to enter into such definitive agreement and
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ or effect
a Change of Recommendation pursuant to clause (x) of _Section 6.3_ unless (x)
the Company delivers to Parent a written notice (a " _Company Notice_ "),
advising Parent that the Company Board proposes to take such action and
containing a summary of the material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board
(including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and copies
of any written proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and (y) at
or after 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day
immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the Company
Notice (such period from the time the Company Notice is provided until 11:59
p.m., Eastern time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day immediately following the
day on which the Company delivered the Company Notice, the " _Notice Period_
"), the Company Board reaffirms in good faith (after consultation with, and
taking into account the advice of, its outside legal counsel and Financial
Advisor and taking into account any adjustment to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement committed to by Parent during the Notice Period) that such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. If requested by Parent, the Company
will, and will cause its Representatives to, during the Notice Period, engage
in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives regarding any
_bona fide_ adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal. The
Company agrees to notify Parent promptly if it determines during such Notice
Period not to terminate this Agreement and enter into the definitive agreement
referred to in the Company Notice. Any amendment to the financial terms or any
other material amendment to the terms and conditions of a proposed agreement
relating to a Superior Proposal will be deemed to be a new proposal or
proposed agreement relating to a Superior Proposal for purposes of this
_Section 6.1(c)_ requiring a new Company Notice and an additional Notice
Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that each such additional Notice Period after
the initial four (4) Business Day Notice Period shall expire at 11:59 p.m.,
Eastern time, on the second (2nd) Business Day immediately following the day
on which the Company delivers such new Company Notice (it being understood
that no such new Company Notice shall reduce the initial Notice Period to less
than four (4) Business Days).

 



 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
meanings assigned below:

 



 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (including a tender
offer or exchange offer) from any Person or group of Persons (other than
Parent or Merger Sub) relating to (A) any merger, consolidation, dissolution,
liquidation, recapitalization, reorganization, spin off, share exchange,
business combination, purchase, or similar transaction with respect to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or (B) (x) any direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, of assets (including equity securities of any subsidiary of the
Company) or businesses that constitute 15% or more of the revenues, net income
or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or
more of the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company, or (y)
any tender offer or exchange

 



     

 

 



 

offer that if consummated would result in any Person or group of Persons
beneficially owning 15% or more of the total voting power of the equity
securities of the Company, or any merger, reorganization, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, joint venture,
partnership, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company (or any
subsidiary or subsidiaries of the Company whose business constitutes 15% or
more of the revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

 



 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
(with all references to "15% or more" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal being deemed to reference "more than 50%") that the Company Board in
good faith, after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of,
the Companys Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel, determines (i)
would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable from a financial
point of view to the stockholders of the Company than the Merger taking into
account all financial, legal, financing (including availability thereof),
regulatory and other aspects and risks and timing of consummation, and any
changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to by Parent in response to
such Superior Proposal pursuant to, and in accordance with, _Section 6.1(c)_
and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed.

 



 

SECTION 6.2 _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall prepare and file with the
SEC, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any
event within 20 Business Days after the date of this Agreement, a preliminary
proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of the Company in connection
with the Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, as amended or
supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
will cooperate and consult with each other in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish to the
Company the information relating to it and its subsidiaries as required by the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set
forth in the Proxy Statement (or that is customarily included in proxy
statements prepared in connection with transactions of the type contemplated
by this Agreement) and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably
requested by the Company. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve all SEC comments, if any, with respect to the Proxy Statement as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. Each Party covenants that none
of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is filed with the
SEC or first mailed to the Companys stockholders or at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the

 



     

 

 



 

circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub of the receipt of any comments from the
SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC for any
amendment to the Proxy Statement or for additional information. If at any time
prior to the Stockholders Meeting any information relating to Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Party and, to the extent required
by applicable Law, the Company shall promptly file with the SEC and
disseminate to the stockholders of the Company an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto, the Company shall
provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on
such document or response and consider in good faith such comments proposed by
Parent for inclusion therein. Unless the Company Board has made a Change of
Recommendation in accordance with _Section 6.3_, the Recommendation shall be
included in the Proxy Statement.

 



 

SECTION 6.3 _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company, acting through the Company
Board (or a committee thereof), shall as soon as reasonably practicable
following the date on which the Company learns that the Proxy Statement will
not be reviewed or that the SEC has no further comments thereon, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders to be held no
more than 50 days thereafter for the purpose of approving and adopting this
Agreement (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the "
_Stockholders Meeting_ ") and shall not postpone, recess or adjourn such
meeting; _provided_ , that the Company may postpone, recess or adjourn such
meeting (i) if on the date on which the Stockholders Meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), the Company has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares to obtain the Company
Requisite Vote or there are insufficient Shares represented (either in person
or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Stockholders Meeting; or (ii) if the failure to postpone, recess or adjourn
the Stockholders Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a violation of
applicable Law for the distribution of any required amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement to be timely provided to the holders of Shares; _provided_
, _further_ , that the Stockholders Meeting shall not be postponed, recessed
or adjourned pursuant to this proviso to a date that is more than 30 days
after the date on which the Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled
without the prior written consent of Parent. The Company, acting through the
Company Board (or a committee thereof), shall (a) subject to _Section
6.1(c)_, include in the Proxy Statement the Recommendation, (b) include the
written opinion of the Financial Advisor, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, that, as of such date, the Per Share Merger Consideration is fair,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of the Common Stock (other than
the holders of Cancelled Shares, Subsidiary Shares and Dissenting Shares), and
(c) subject to _Section 6.1(c)_, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the Company Requisite Vote, including to solicit proxies necessary to obtain
the Company Requisite Vote; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company Board may fail to include
the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or withdraw, modify, qualify in any
manner adverse to Parent, or change the Recommendation, or formally resolve to
effect or publicly announce an intention to effect any of the foregoing (a "
_Change of Recommendation_ "), if (x) (A) a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal
that was made after the date hereof and was not initiated, solicited,
knowingly encouraged or facilitated in violation of _Section 6.1_ is made to
the Company and is not withdrawn and the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its
Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal or (B) there exists any Intervening Event, (y)
the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with, and taking into account the advice of, outside legal counsel to the
Company, that the failure of the Company

 



     

 

 



 

Board to effect a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (z) (A) if such Change of
Recommendation is made in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company
complies with the provisions of _Section 6.1(c)_ or (B) if such Change of
Recommendation is made in response to an Intervening Event, the Company (x)
delivers to Parent a written notice informing Parent that the Company Board
proposes to take such action and the basis of the proposed action (including a
reasonably detailed description of the underlying facts giving rise to, and
the reasons for taking, such action) no less than four (4) Business Days
before taking such action and (y) during such four (4) Business Day period, if
requested by Parent, engages in good faith negotiations with Parent and its
Representatives regarding any adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement proposed by Parent so that such event, development, circumstance,
change, effect, condition or occurrence would cease to warrant a Change of
Recommendation. The Company shall keep Parent updated with respect to proxy
solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if subsequent to the
date of this Agreement the Company Board makes a Change of Recommendation, the
Company nevertheless shall submit this Agreement to the holders of Shares for
approval and adoption at the Stockholders Meeting unless and until this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

 



 

SECTION 6.4 _Further Action; Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including _Section
6.4(d)_, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to use its reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to
be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under this
Agreement and applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party agrees to,
as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable, and in any event no later
than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, make
appropriate filings of Notification and Report Forms pursuant to the HSR Act.
Each Party will cooperate with the other Party and use its respective
reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable and advisable, prepare
and submit all other filings, information updates and other presentations
required for any other regulatory approval, exemption, change of ownership
approval, or other authorization or consent from, any Governmental Entity or
third party in each case that are set forth on _Schedule 6.4(a)_ or are
otherwise required in connection with the Merger or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and to assist and cooperate with the other
Party in connection with the foregoing.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Sections 6.4(d)_ and _6.4(e)_ , each of Parent, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall (i) cooperate in all respects
with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by
a private party, (ii) keep the other Party and/or its counsel reasonably
informed of any communication received by such Party from, or given by such
Party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other U.S. or foreign
Governmental Entity, and of any communication received or given in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) permit the other Party and/or its
counsel to review any substantive communication given by it to, and consult
with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC
or any such other

 



     

 

 



 

Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party,
with any other person, and to the extent not prohibited by the DOJ, the FTC or
such other Governmental Entity or other person, give the other Party and/or
its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in any substantive
meeting, discussion or teleconference. Parent and the Company may, as each
deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section 6.4(b)_ as
"Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the
case may be) or its legal counsel. Each of Parent and the Company shall notify
the other reasonably promptly upon the receipt of (i) any material
communication from any official of any Governmental Entity in connection with
any filing made pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) knowledge of the commencement
or threat of commencement of any suits, claims, actions, proceedings,
arbitrations, mediations, consent decrees, audits or investigations (whether
governmental, internal or otherwise) (" _Actions_ ") by or before any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger (and shall keep the other Party
informed as to the status of any such Action or threat) and (iii) any request
by any official of any Governmental Entity for any amendment or supplement to
any filing made pursuant to this Agreement or any information required to
comply with applicable Law applicable to the Merger. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this _Section 6.4_, materials provided pursuant
to this _Section 6.4(b)_ may be redacted to (x) remove references concerning
the valuation of the Company and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (y) to the extent necessary to comply with contractual arrangements
and (z) to the extent necessary to address reasonable privilege and
confidentiality concerns.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Sections 6.4(d)_, in the event that any Action is commenced
or threatened by a Governmental Entity or other persons challenging the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under Antitrust Law,
(i) each of Parent and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with each other
and (ii) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to contest, resist or
resolve any such Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other Order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement so as to permit such consummation no later than the End Date
(as such End Date may be extended in accordance with _Section 8.1(c)_
hereof), and oppose any such Actions, whether judicial or administrative,
against it in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(d) In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries to, (i) propose, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent
decree, hold separate orders or otherwise, the sale, divesture, disposition,
or license of any assets, operations, properties, products, rights, licenses,
services or businesses of Parent or its subsidiaries or the Company or its
subsidiaries, or any interest therein, and (ii) otherwise take or commit to
take any actions that would limit Parents or its subsidiaries or the
Companys or its subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or its or
their ability to retain any assets, operations, properties, products, rights,
licenses, services, businesses, of Parent or its subsidiaries or the Company
or its subsidiaries, or any interest therein; _provided_ , that Parent shall
not be required or obligated to take or agree to take any of the foregoing
actions if such actions would result in or account for,

 



     

 

 



 

either individually or in the aggregate, a reduction of revenue (without
duplication and net of intercompany revenues) in excess of $200,000,000 (for
any rolling 12-month period ending the last full month prior to any date
between the date hereof and the Closing Date) to Parent, the Company and their
respective subsidiaries (taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger)
if such actions had been taken at the beginning of any such rolling 12-month
period; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such actions are conditioned upon
the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that the Company shall not be obligated to take any action with
respect to the Company and its subsidiaries the effectiveness of which is not
conditioned on the Closing occurring.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall
control the strategy for obtaining all consents, approvals, or waivers that
may be sought from any Governmental Entity pursuant to this _Section 6.4_,
including by directing the timing, nature, and substance of any filings,
forms, statements, commitments, submissions and communications contemplated by
or made in accordance with this _Section 6.4_, as well as the manner in which
to contest or otherwise respond, by litigation or otherwise, to objections to,
or proceedings or other actions challenging, the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that
Parent shall give the Company the opportunity to participate in such
discussions, negotiations or other proceedings to the extent not prohibited by
applicable Law.

 



 

(f) At Parents request, the Company agrees to take all reasonable actions
Parent requests and to cooperate with Parent in connection with obtaining any
actions, consents, undertakings, approvals or waivers by or from any
Governmental Entity for or in connection with, and reasonably cooperate with
Parent in litigating or otherwise contesting any objections to or proceedings
or other actions challenging, the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Company will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, (i) reasonably assist
Parent in any sales process (including through facilitation of reasonable due
diligence and granting any approvals that may be required under the
Confidentiality Agreement) with potential purchasers of any of the Companys
or its subsidiaries businesses or other assets proposed by Parent to be
subject to any such divestitures and (ii) enter into one or more agreements as
requested by Parent to be entered into by any of them prior to the Closing
with respect to any transaction to divest, hold separate or otherwise take any
action that would limit the Companys or its subsidiaries freedom of action,
ownership or control with respect to, or their ability to retain or hold,
directly or indirectly, any of the businesses or assets of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Divestiture Action_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the consummation of the transactions provided for in any such
agreement for a Company Divestiture Action will be conditioned upon the
Closing or satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver
of all of the conditions to Closing in a case where the Closing will occur
immediately following consummation of such Company Divestiture Action. The
Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Representatives to, make
any offer, acceptance or counter-offer to or otherwise engage in negotiations
or discussions with any Governmental Entity with respect to any proposed
settlement, consent, decree, commitment or remedy or, in the event of
litigation, discovery, admissibility of evidence, timing or scheduling, except
as specifically requested by or agreed with Parent.

 



      

 

 



 

SECTION 6.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent shall
each give prompt notice to the other Party of (a) any written notice or other
written communication received from any Governmental Entity in connection with
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any other
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Merger, if the subject matter of such communication or the
failure to obtain such consent would reasonably be expected to be material to
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent and (b) any Proceeding
commenced or, to the knowledge of the Company or Parent, respectively, is
threatened which relates to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby (in each case of sub-clauses (a) and (b) other than with respect to
Antitrust Laws, which are the subject of _Section 6.4_) and (c) upon becoming
aware of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which such Party has determined would or would reasonably be
expected to cause or result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth
in _Article VII_ not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions
being materially delayed in violation of any provision of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 6.5_ shall not (i) affect the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of the Parties or the conditions to the obligations of the
Parties under this Agreement or (ii) limit the remedies available to the Party
receiving such notification.

 



 

SECTION 6.6 _Access to Information and Cooperation; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice from Parent, the Company
shall, and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause its subsidiaries,
officers, directors and employees to, afford the officers, employees, auditors
and other authorized representatives of Parent reasonable access, consistent
with applicable Law, at all reasonable business hours to its officers,
employees, properties, offices, and other facilities and books and records
(including personnel records), and shall furnish Parent with financial,
operating and other data and information as Parent, through its officers,
employees or authorized representatives, may from time to time reasonably
request in writing and use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and
make its officers, employees or authorized representatives reasonably
available to provide additional information and access as may be reasonably
requested by Parent. Such access shall include (x) access after the date of
the Stockholders Meeting as reasonably required for the preparation of non-
invasive environmental assessments, (y) updates on a regular basis to Parents
internal and external counsel regarding the Companys material class-action
litigations, including the status thereof, and any discharge or settlement
proceedings, and the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with
the Company with respect to the defense of such litigations, and the Company
shall not settle or agree to settle any such litigations in an aggregate
amount for all such litigations in excess of $10,000,000 without prior
consultation with Parent; _provided_ , that Parent shall not have the right to
consult with the Company to the extent any settlement terms include any
pricing mechanism or other restriction on pricing, and (z) updates on a
regular basis regarding the Companys anticipated corrective actions relating
to elevated temperature, slope stability and related odor concerns at any
landfill sites owned or operated by the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
and the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company
with respect to such corrective actions and consider in good faith any
reasonable corrective actions recommended by Parent. Any such access shall be
at reasonable times during normal business hours and under supervision of a
designee of the Company, at the Companys

 



     

 

 



 

discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any such access shall be in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations
of the Company or its subsidiaries; (ii) neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries shall be required to provide access where the Company determines
in its reasonable judgment that such access would be reasonably likely to (A)
result in the loss of the protection of any attorney-client or other privilege
held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or contravene any Law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment or (B) breach any binding agreement entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
with any third party, _provided_ that the Company shall have used commercially
reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of this clause (ii) would apply.
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its subsidiaries from
and against any losses that may be incurred by any of them arising out of or
related to the use, storage or handling of (x) any personally identifiable
information relating to employees, providers or customers of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, and (y) any other information that is protected by
applicable Law (including privacy Laws) and to which Parent or its
Representatives are afforded access pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will comply with the terms and conditions of
the letter agreement, dated November 23, 2018, between the Company and Parent
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and will hold and treat, and will cause
their respective Representatives to hold and treat, in confidence all
documents and information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries
furnished to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms; _provided_ , that the execution of this
Agreement by the Company shall constitute written consent by the Company and
the Company Board pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement to all actions by
Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives permitted or contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company agrees that without any
further action on its part any potential debt or equity financing source of
Parent or Merger Sub (including the Financing Sources), in each case shall
constitute "Representatives" of Parent for purposes of the Confidentiality
Agreement (it being understood that notwithstanding anything in the
Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Representatives may disclose any information to such prospective
debt and equity financing sources, subject to receipt of customary
confidentiality undertakings from such prospective debt and equity financing
sources).

 



 

SECTION 6.7 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and
policies of the New York Stock Exchange to enable the delisting of the Shares
from the New York Stock Exchange and the deregistration of the Shares under
the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

 



 

SECTION 6.8 _Publicity_. Following the execution of this Agreement, Parent and
the Company shall issue an initial joint press release agreed upon by Parent
and the Company regarding the Merger, and thereafter, during the Pre-Closing
Period, neither the Company nor Parent shall issue any press releases or
otherwise make public announcements with respect to the

 



     

 

 



 

Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
other Partys prior consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) in each case, except as such release or announcement
may be required by Law or by the rules or regulations of any United States
securities exchange to which the relevant Party is subject, in which case such
Party shall use reasonable efforts to consult with the other Party in advance
of such release or announcement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the restrictions in this _Section 6.8_ shall not
apply to any communication made by any Party regarding an Acquisition Proposal
or a Change of Recommendation or in connection with any Proceeding in which
the Parties are adverse to each other. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) each
Party may, without such consultation, make internal announcements to employees
and make disclosures in documents (including exhibits and all other
information incorporated therein) required to be filed or furnished by the
Company with the SEC, so long as such statements are consistent in all
respects with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements
made jointly by the Parties (or individually in accordance with this _Section
6.8_) and (b) each Party may, without such consultation, make any public
statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or
those attending industry conferences so long as such statements are not
inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by the Parties hereto (or individually in accordance
with this _Section 6.8_).

 



 

SECTION 6.9 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the twelve-month
anniversary of the Closing Date (or, if shorter, during an employees period
of employment following the Closing Date), Parent shall provide, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each employee of the Company or
its subsidiaries who is not represented by a labor organization and who
continue to be employed by the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any
subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (each a " _Continuing Non-Union Employee_ "),
(i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less than that provided to such
Continuing Non-Union Employee by the Company or its subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) severance benefits that are no less
favorable than those provided to such Continuing Non-Union Employee by the
Company or its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii)
all other compensation and benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided to such Continuing Non-Union Employee by the
Company or its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Commencing as of the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries and Affiliates to, honor in
accordance with their terms, all Contracts, policies, plans and commitments of
the Company and its subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are applicable to any of their current or former employees
and directors, including those annual incentive award terms set forth in
_Section 6.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(b) Commencing as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries shall, as required by _Section 6.9(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, (i) observe the terms of each of their existing Collective
Bargaining Agreements that govern the wages, hours and other terms and
conditions of employment of employees of the Company or its subsidiaries who
are covered by such Collective Bargaining Agreements and who continue to be
employed by the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof

 



     

 

 



 

(the " _Continuing Union-Represented Employees_ ") and (ii) honor their
Collective Bargaining Agreements until their respective expiration,
modification or amendment.

 



 

(c) Parent and the Company hereby agree that the occurrence of the Closing
shall constitute a "Change in Control" for purposes of all Company Plans and
related trusts.

 



 

(d) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Parent or its subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) following the Effective Time and in which any of the Continuing
Employees participate (the " _Parent Plans_ "), for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting, accrual of and entitlement to benefits
(but not for benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans or
participation in frozen (whether as to new participants or benefit accruals)
post-employment or retiree welfare benefits), service with the Company and its
subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides past
service credit) shall be treated as service with Parent and its subsidiaries,
except to the extent such treatment will result in duplication of benefits.
With respect to each applicable Parent Plan, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries and Affiliates to, waive, or cause
the insurance carrier to waive, all eligibility waiting periods and pre-
existing condition limitations to the extent waived, met or not included under
a corresponding Company Plan, and credit each Continuing Employee and any
covered dependent for any co-payments and deductibles and use commercially
reasonable efforts to credit out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Continuing
Employee or any covered dependent under the Company Plans during the relevant
plan year, up to and including the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) From and after the date hereof, prior to disseminating or otherwise
disclosing any material communication with the officers or employees of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries regarding commitments to compensation,
benefits or other employment-related treatment they will receive following the
Effective Time, the Company shall provide Parent with such communications and
a reasonable opportunity to comment, and the Company shall consider Parents
comments, if any, in good faith.

 



 

(f) If requested by Parent, as of at least ten days prior to the Closing Date
(but conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing), the Company shall seek
approval from the Company Board to terminate or cause to be terminated any or
all of the Company Plans sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries that are intended to be qualified within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code (the " _Company 401(k) Plans_"). The Company and Parent
shall cooperate in good faith prior to the Closing with respect to the
preparation and execution of all documentation necessary to effect the
foregoing termination, and the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on all such documentation. To the extent any
Company 401(k) Plan is terminated pursuant to Parents request, the Continuing
Employees shall be eligible to participate in a Parent Plan that is intended
to be qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (and meets
the qualifications thereof) as soon as practicable following the Effective
Time.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Person any right to
continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or

 



     

 

 



 

any Affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to
discharge or terminate the services of any Person at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.9_ shall (i) be deemed
or construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Company Plan,
Parent Plan or any other compensation or benefit plan, (ii) prevent Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent from amending or
terminating any Company Plans in accordance with their terms or (iii) create
any third-party rights in any Person (including any employee or other service
provider or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 



 

SECTION 6.10 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) For six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (in each case, when acting or having
acted in such capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, arbitration, proceeding, investigation, mediation, consent decree, audit
or inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and
whether formal or informal (each, a " _Proceeding_ "), arising out of matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that
the Company would have been required under applicable Law, the Certificate of
Incorporation, the Bylaws, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or
equivalent governing documents) of any of the Companys subsidiaries, and any
indemnification agreements with any directors and officers of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "
_Existing Indemnification Rights_ ") to indemnify such Person (and the
Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys fees to the fullest extent that the Company would have
been required to advance expenses under the Existing Indemnification Rights)
as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled
to indemnification). In the event any Proceeding is brought against any
Indemnified Party and in which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Party under this _Section 6.10_, (i) the Surviving Corporation
shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time
and the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate with Parent and the Surviving
Corporation in such defense; _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation shall
pay all reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified
Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation, promptly as statements therefor are received to the fullest
extent that the Company would have been required to pay such fees and expenses
under the Existing Indemnification Rights; (ii) Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter if the Parent or
Surviving Corporation elects not to assume the defense thereof; (iii) neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement
effected without their prior written consent and (iv) neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any pending or threatened Proceeding to which an Indemnified Party
is a party (and in respect of which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents.

 



     

 

 



 

In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
consolidates or amalgamates or merges into with any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation,
amalgamation or merger, then proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.10_.

 



 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a)
of this _Section 6.10_, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall
reasonably promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so notify shall
not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have
to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices the indemnifying Party.

 



 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the provisions in the Surviving
Corporations Charter and bylaws with respect to indemnification, advancement
of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and officers shall
be no less favorable to such directors and officers than such provisions
contained in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws in effect
as of the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in
any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals
who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors and officers of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, except to the extent required by
applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted and, if the
Company fails to do so, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies for the
extension of the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys
existing directors and officers insurance policies for a claims period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, that shall be from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
insurance carrier as of the date hereof with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with
benefits and levels of coverage (including terms relating thereto) that are at
least as favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect to matters
existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time (including in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated thereby);
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company expend, or shall
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend, for such policies
an aggregate premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently
paid by the Company for such insurance (which current annual premium amount is
set forth in _Section 6.10(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule). If the
Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to
maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement
with benefits and levels of coverage (including terms relating thereto) that
are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of
the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with benefits and
levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for

 



     

 

 



 

such policies an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their
respective heirs, successors and representatives.

 



 

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 6.10_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws (or equivalent governing documents) of any subsidiaries of the Company
or the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or under any Law or
indemnification agreement to which any Indemnified Party is a party in effect
as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(g) With respect to any indemnification obligations of the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to this _Section 6.10_, Parent hereby acknowledges and
agrees that the Surviving Corporation shall be the indemnitor of first resort
with respect to all indemnification obligations of the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to this _Section 6.10_ (i.e., its obligations to an applicable
Indemnified Party are primary and any obligation of any other person to
advance expenses or to provide indemnification and/or insurance for the same
expenses or losses incurred by such Indemnified Parties are secondary).

 



 

SECTION 6.11 _Transaction Litigation_. In the event that any litigation
related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement is brought against the Company or any member of the Company
Board during the Pre-Closing Period (the " _Transaction Litigation_ "), the
Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such Transaction Litigation and
shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The
Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company with
respect to the defense of any Transaction Litigation, and the Company shall
not settle or agree to settle any Transaction Litigation without Parents
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



 

SECTION 6.12 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement.
During the Pre-Closing Period, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not
permit Merger Sub to, engage in any activity of any nature except as provided
in, expressly contemplated by or in furtherance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 6.13 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause
any dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



     

 

 



 

SECTION 6.14 _Financing Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries, and shall use its
reasonable efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to, use
its and their respective reasonable efforts to provide such customary
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub or their
respective Affiliates in connection with any Financing made, or to be made, by
Parent or any of its subsidiaries and any SEC filing related to the Financing
to be made by Parent, including by: (i) using reasonable efforts to, upon
reasonable advance written notice, provide reasonable contact, including with
respect to customary due diligence, among the Companys and its subsidiaries
senior management and appropriate senior management, representatives, advisors
and the Financing Sources; (ii) providing such customary historical financial
and other customary pertinent information with respect to the Company and its
subsidiaries (including, in any event, the Required Financial Information) as
may be reasonably requested or reasonably required by Parent for use in
connection with the Financing and designating, upon request, whether any such
information is suitable to be made available to lenders and other investors
who do not wish to receive material non-public information with respect to the
Company and its subsidiaries or their respective securities; (iii) providing
information regarding the Company and its subsidiaries reasonably necessary or
customarily required to assist Parent in preparing pro forma financial
statements if Parent reasonably determines such pro forma financial statements
are necessary, required or customary in connection with the Financing or any
other SEC filing related to the Financing to be made by Parent (it being
understood that the Company need only reasonably assist in the preparation
thereof, but shall not be required to independently prepare any separate pro
forma financial statements and shall not be required to change its fiscal
year); (iv) using commercially reasonable efforts to cause Ernst and Young LLP
to provide reasonable and customary assistance to Parent, including by
participating in accounting due diligence sessions, obtaining the consent of,
and facilitating the delivery of, customary comfort letters (including as to
negative assurance) from, Ernst and Young LLP (including by providing customary
management letters and requesting legal letters to obtain such consent) if
necessary, desirable or customary for Parents use of the financial statements
of the Company and its subsidiaries in any marketing or offering materials to
be used in connection with the Financing; (v) taking all organizational
actions and executing and delivering any definitive financing agreements, any
customary certificates or other customary documents or instruments relating to
guarantees or other matters related to the Financing, subject to the
occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the
Financing and repayment or refinancing of indebtedness in connection with the
Merger; (vi) furnishing reasonably promptly (and in any event at least three
(3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) all documentation and other
information reasonably requested in writing at least ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date required by any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the U.S. Patriot Act and the
Beneficial Ownership Regulation (to the extent applicable); (vii) obtaining
customary payoff letters, lien releases and instruments of discharge in
respect of the Company Credit Agreement; (viii) reasonably cooperating with
legal counsel to Parent and Merger Sub in connection with any legal opinions
that such counsel may be required to deliver in connection with any Financing;

required by the Company Credit Agreement (or such shorter period as may be
acceptable to the agent or the lenders thereunder) and issuing conditional
notices of redemption with respect to the Company Notes, as

 



     

 

 



 

reasonably requested by Parent. The Company hereby consents to the use of the
trademarks, service marks and logos of the Company and its subsidiaries in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing so long as such trademarks,
service marks and logos are used in a manner that is not intended to harm or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its subsidiaries
or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any its subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall require such cooperation
to the extent it would (i) unreasonably disrupt the ordinary conduct of the
business or operations of the Company or its subsidiaries, (ii) require the
Company or its subsidiaries to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses
or otherwise incur any actual liability or give any indemnities in each case
prior to the Effective Time unless Parent reimburses or is required to
reimburse or indemnify the Company or its subsidiaries pursuant to this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to any series of
Company Notes or the Company Credit Agreement, neither the Company nor any of
its subsidiaries shall be required to make any payments of outstanding
principal, accrued and unpaid interest and/or applicable premiums or consent
payments (other than with respect to scheduled payments of principal and
interest) unless Parent has irrevocably deposited funds sufficient to cover
such amounts with the applicable trustee or agent, (iii) require the Company
or its subsidiaries to take any action that would reasonably be expected, in
the reasonable judgment of the Company, to conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, any applicable Laws or obligations of confidentiality
(not created in contemplation hereof) binding on the Company or its
subsidiaries, (iv) require the Company or its subsidiaries to (A) subject to
the requirements of _Section 6.15_, pass resolutions or consents, approve or
authorize the execution of, or execute any document, agreement, certificate or
instrument or take any other corporate action with respect to the Financing

Effective Time or (B) provide or cause its legal counsel to provide any legal
opinions that are not required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by _Section 6.15_, (v) require the Company to prepare separate
financial statements or any new compensation information or (vi) require the
Company or any subsidiary thereof to incur additional indebtedness prior to
the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement (including this _Section 6.14_), nothing in this Agreement shall
require the Company to cause the delivery of (A) any reliance letter, any
certificate as to solvency or any other certificate necessary for the
Financing other than as contemplated by clause (iii) of the first sentence in
this _Section 6.14(a)_, (B) any financial information in a form not
customarily prepared by the Company with respect to any period or (C) any
financial information with respect to a month of fiscal period that has not
yet ended or has ended less than forty-five (45) days prior to the date of
such request. Parent acknowledges and agrees that any access or information
contemplated to be provided by the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant
to this _Section 6.14_ shall, to the extent such information constitutes
material non-public information of the Company, only be provided to other
Persons, including any Financing Sources, if such other Person affirmatively
agrees to maintain the confidentiality of such information pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement and to comply with all federal and state
securities laws and regulations applicable to such information, except with
respect to such information that would be required to be disclosed in respect
of an offering of securities in connection with the Financing to ensure that
the offering materials in respect of such securities would not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



      

 

 



 

(b) Parent shall, promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and
expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) to the extent such costs,
fees and expenses are incurred by the Company, its subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives in connection with any such party complying with
the obligations under this _Section 6.14_, and Parent shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims,
interest, awards, judgments, penalties, costs or expenses suffered or incurred
by them to the extent such losses, damages, claims, interest, awards,
judgments, penalties, costs or expenses arose out of the actions taken by the
Company, its subsidiaries or their respective Representatives pursuant to this
_Section 6.14_ (other than information provided by the Company, its
subsidiaries or Representatives in writing for express use therein), except in
the event such losses, damages, claims, interest, awards, judgments,
penalties, costs or expenses are determined by a final non-appealable judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen out of or resulted from
the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Company, any of
its subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is understood and
agreed that the Company shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligations
under this _Section 6.14_ unless the Companys failure to reasonably satisfy
its obligations under this _Section 6.14_ was the primary cause of, or
primarily resulted in, any Financing not being obtained.

 



 

SECTION 6.15 _Debt Offers_.

 



 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of any written request
by Parent to do so and at the expense of Parent, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) commence an offer to purchase for cash,
with respect to any or all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of
the senior notes of the Company set forth in _Section 6.15_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company Notes_ ") (each an " _Offer to Purchase_ "
and collectively, the " _Offers to Purchase_ ") and/or to conduct consent
solicitations with respect to the Company Notes regarding certain proposed
amendments to the Indenture (the " _Indenture Amendments_ ") as reasonably
requested by Parent (the " _Consent Solicitation_ " and, together with the
Offer to Purchase, the " _Debt Offer_ "), in each case, on such terms and
conditions, including pricing terms and amendments to the terms and provisions
of the Indenture, that are specified, from time to time, by Parent; _provided_
that, in any event, Parent and the Company hereby agree that (i) the terms and
conditions of the Offer to Purchase shall provide that the closing thereof
shall be contingent upon the consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time
and in no event shall the Company be required to purchase any Notes prior to
the Effective Time, (ii) the Company shall not be required to commence any
Debt Offer until Parent shall have provided the Company with draft
documentation and final documents shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (and any legal opinions required by the Debt
Offers shall be provided by Parents counsel, _provided_ , that if requested
by Parent, the Companys counsel shall provide all customary legal opinions
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this _Section
6.15_ to the extent such legal opinion is required to be delivered prior to
the Closing Date (notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company
or its legal counsel be required to give an opinion with respect to a Debt
Offer that in the opinion of the Company or its legal counsel does not comply
with applicable Laws or the applicable

 



     

 

 



 

indenture, or an opinion with respect to financing by Parent)), (iii) the
terms and conditions specified by Parent for the Debt Offer shall be in
compliance with the Indenture, the Company Credit Agreement and any applicable
Law (including the requirements of Rule 14e-1 promulgated under the Exchange
Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended), (iv) the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the trustee to agree to
proceed with the redemption of the Company Notes at least 35 days (or such
shorter period as the trustee may agree to) before the expected redemption
date (which shall not be prior to the Effective Time), which notices to
holders, to the extent applicable, may be subject to one or more conditions
precedent, and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the trustee to
provide such notice to holders of such Company Notes substantially
concurrently with the completion of the Closing, (v) the Company shall provide
Parent the opportunity to review and comment on each of the notices and other
documents contemplated by the foregoing sub-clause (iv) reasonably in advance
of their delivery, and (vi) the Company shall use commercially reasonable best
efforts to take all other actions and prepare and deliver all other documents
(including any officers certificates) as may be required under the Indenture
to (A) issue an irrevocable notice of redemption providing for the redemption
on or after the Closing Date (but in no event shall such redemption occur
prior to the Effective Time) of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of
the Company Notes (together with all accrued and unpaid interest and
applicable premiums related to the Company Notes) pursuant to the applicable
provisions of the Indenture and (B) cause the satisfaction and discharge of
the Indenture and the Company Notes substantially concurrently with the
Closing (but in no event prior to the Effective Time) (subject to the
irrevocable deposit with the trustee on the Closing Date of funds sufficient
to pay in full the outstanding aggregate principal amount of, accrued and
unpaid interest through the redemption date on, and applicable premiums
related to, the Company Notes, as arranged by, and at the expense of, Parent).
Parent shall assist the Company in connection with the foregoing as reasonably
requested by the Company. Subject to the preceding sentence, the Company
shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Offers.
The Company shall waive any of the conditions to the Debt Offers as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in writing that after consultation with its
legal counsel the Company determines can be legally waived (other than that
the Merger shall have been consummated) and shall not, without the written
consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Offers or make any changes
to the Debt Offers.

 



 

(b) The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following the consent
solicitation expiration date, if any, and assuming the requisite consents are
received in the consent solicitation constituting part of the Debt Offer, each
of the Company and its applicable subsidiaries as is necessary shall (and
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the trustee to)
execute supplemental indentures to the Indenture, which supplemental
indentures shall implement the amendments described in the offer to purchase,
consent solicitation statement, related letter of transmittal, and other
related documents; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the fact that
a supplemental indenture may become effective earlier, the proposed amendments
set forth therein shall not become operative unless and until the Effective
Time has occurred.

 



 

(c) The dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent, depositary or
other agent retained in connection with the Debt Offers shall be selected by
Parent. The

 



     

 

 



 

Company shall enter into customary agreements (including indemnities, which
shall be subject to _Section 6.15(d)_) with such parties so selected and on
terms and conditions acceptable to Parent.

 



 

(d) Parent shall, promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and
expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) to the extent such costs,

respective Representatives in connection with it complying with its
obligations under this _Section 6.15_, and Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its subsidiaries and Representatives from and against
any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by
them to the extent such losses, damages, claims, interest, awards, judgments,
penalties, costs or expenses arose out of the actions taken by the Company,
its subsidiaries or its Representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.15_
(other than information provided in writing by the Company or its subsidiaries
or Representatives), except in the event such losses, damages, claims,
interest, awards, judgments, penalties, costs or expenses are determined by a
final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have
arisen out of or resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct by
the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.15_ shall
require the Companys cooperation to the extent it would (i) unreasonably
disrupt the ordinary conduct of the business or operations of the Company or
its subsidiaries, (ii) require the Company or its subsidiaries to agree to pay
any fees, reimburse any expenses or otherwise incur any liability or give any
indemnities prior to the Effective Time unless Parent reimburses or is
required to reimburse or indemnify the Company or its subsidiaries pursuant to
this Agreement, (iii) require the Company or its subsidiaries to take any
action that would reasonably be expected, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company, to conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, any
applicable Laws, order or any Contract of the Company, (iv) cause any
representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached or become
inaccurate, cause any condition to the Closing to fail to be satisfied or
otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement or (v) cause the Company to be
obligated with respect to the purchase, redemption or satisfaction and
discharge of any Company Notes in the event the Merger is not consummated.

 



 

SECTION 6.16 _Anti-Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price", "moratorium",
"control share acquisition", "business combination" or other similar
antitakeover statute or regulation enacted under any federal, state, local or
foreign Laws applicable to the Company is, or will be, applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger, the Voting and Support Agreement or the other
transactions contemplated hereby is or may become applicable to this Agreement
(including the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby) and the
Voting and Support Agreement, the Company and the Company Board shall grant
all such approvals and take all such actions within their control as are
necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable hereafter on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the
Voting and Support Agreement and shall otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

deemed to have been satisfied unless the failure of such representations and
warranties of the Company to be so true and correct (without giving effect to
any "Material Adverse Effect", "materiality" or similar qualifications
contained therein), individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the condition set forth in
this _Section 7.3(a)(ii)_ shall be deemed to have been satisfied unless the
failure of any such representations and warranties to be true and correct,

materially impair or have a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent

 **TERMINATION; AMENDMENT AND WAIVER**

 



 

SECTION 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may
be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding the
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company (except in the
case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ which may only be
invoked prior to the receipt of the Company Requisite Vote) (the date of any
such termination, the " _Termination Date_ "):

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 



 

(b) by Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction sitting in the United States shall have issued a Legal Restraint
which permanently prevents, makes illegal, prohibits, restrains or enjoins the
consummation of the Merger and such Legal Restraint is or shall have become
final and nonappealable; _provided_ , that the Party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_ did not breach in any material
respect any provision of this Agreement which breach was the primary cause of,
or primarily resulted in, the issuance of such order, decree or ruling or the
taking of any such other final action;

 



 

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or before April 14, 2020 (as such date may be extended pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement or by the mutual written consent of Parent and the
Company, the " _End Date_ "); _provided_ , if on the End Date all of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_, _Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.3_ have
been satisfied (or, with respect to the conditions that by their terms must be
satisfied at the Closing, would have been so satisfied if the Closing would
have occurred) or remain capable of being satisfied but any of the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ and/or _Section 7.1(c)_ has not been
satisfied, then the End Date shall automatically be extended for an additional
90 days, in which case the End Date shall be deemed for all purposes to be
such later date; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Party seeking to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall not be in breach or
have breached in any material respect any provision of this Agreement in any
manner that shall have primarily contributed to the failure of the Effective
Time to occur on or before the End Date;

 



 

(d) by written notice of the Company:

 



 

(i) if there shall have been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement,

 



     

 

 



 

or any such representation or warranty shall be or shall have become
inaccurate, such that if continuing as of the Closing Date the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ would not be satisfied, and,
in either such case, such breach is not curable prior to the End Date;
_provided_ , that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ if the Company is then in
material breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) if the Company Board determines to enter into an acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or similar agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal
prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, in accordance
with, and subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of, _Section
6.1(c)_;

 



 

(e) by written notice of Parent:

 



 

(i) if there shall have been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company contained in this Agreement,
or any such representation or warranty shall be or shall have become
inaccurate, such that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or
_Section 7.2(b)_ would not be satisfied, and, in either such case, such
breach is not curable prior to the End Date; _provided_ , that Parent shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1(e)(i)_ if Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) if the Company Board (A) shall have made a Change of Recommendation, (B)
shall have failed to include the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement
distributed to stockholders, (C) shall have recommended, approved or otherwise
declared advisable to the stockholders of the Company an Acquisition Proposal,

pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act, within the 10 Business Day
period (as specified in Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act) after such tender
offer or exchange offer is first published, sent or given, or subsequently
amended in any material respect, a statement recommending that stockholders
reject such tender offer or exchange offer and affirming the Recommendation,
or (E) shall have formally resolved to effect or publicly announced an
intention to effect any of the foregoing, prior to obtaining the Company
Requisite Vote; or

 



 

(f) by either Parent or the Company if the Company Requisite Vote shall not
have been obtained at the Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at
any adjournment or postponement thereof, in each case, at which a vote on the
adoption of this Agreement was taken.

_Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_ and _Article IX_, which shall survive such
termination; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve any
Party hereto of any liability for damages resulting from fraud or Willful
Breach prior to such termination by any Party hereto (which the Parties
acknowledge and agree shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
in accordance with _Section 9.13_ applying the governing Law in accordance
with _Section 9.9_), in which case the aggrieved Party shall be entitled to
all rights and remedies available at law or equity. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that (i) nothing in this _Section 8.2_ shall be deemed to affect
their right to specific performance under _Section 9.12_ and (ii) no
termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the Parties
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event that:

 



 

(i) this Agreement is terminated (x) by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_ ( _Superior Proposal_ ), (y) by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)(ii)_ ( _Change of Recommendation_ ), or (z) by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ ( _Company Requisite Vote_ ) at a time

( _Change of Recommendation_ ), then the Company shall pay $100,000,000 (the "
_Company Termination Fee_ ") to Parent (or its designee), at or prior to the
time of termination and as a condition to such termination in the case of a
termination by the Company or as promptly as reasonably practicable in the
case of a termination by Parent (and, in any event, within two Business Days
following such termination), payable by wire transfer of immediately available
funds;

 



 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(f)_ ( _Company Requisite Vote_ ) or by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(e)(i)_ ( _Breach_ ), or by either Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section 8.1(c)_ ( _End Date_ ) (other than in circumstances in which
Parent is required to pay the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
8.2(b)(iv)_) and (A) at any time after the date of this Agreement but prior to
the date of the Stockholders Meeting (in the case of _Section 8.1(f)_), prior
to the breach giving rise to such right of termination (in the case of
_Section 8.1(e)(i)_) and prior to such termination (in the case of _Section
8.1(c)_), any Person shall have announced (which announcement in the case of
_Section 8.1(f)_) must have been publicly made) an intention to make an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional), which, in the case of
_Section 8.1(f)_, was not withdrawn at least three (3) Business Days prior to
the Stockholders Meeting) and (B) within twelve (12) months after the
Termination Date, (x) the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall have
entered into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
or (y) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated involving the
Company or any of its subsidiaries (in each case of clause (x) or (y) whether
or not involving the same Acquisition Proposal as that which was publicly
announced), then in each case of clause (x) or (y) the Company shall pay or
cause to be paid to Parent (or its designee) the Company Termination Fee, such
payment to be made within two (2) Business Days from the earliest to occur of
the foregoing events, payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for
purposes of this _Section 8.2(b)(ii)_, references to "15%" in the definition
of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%";

 



     

 

 



 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(f)_ ( _Company Requisite Vote_ ) or by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(e)(i)_ ( _Breach_ ), then the Company shall promptly, but in no
event later than two (2) days after being notified of such by Parent, pay to
Parent (or its designee) all of the documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with or related to the authorization,
preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement up to a maximum amount of
$15,000,000, payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds;
_provided_ , that any amounts paid under this _Section 8.2(b)(iii)_ shall be
credited (without interest) against any Company Termination Fee if paid to
Parent (or its designee) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; or

 



 

(iv) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to (x)
_Section 8.1(b)_ ( _Legal Restraint_ ) and the applicable Legal Restraint
giving rise to such termination right is issued under or pursuant to any
Antitrust Law or (y) _Section 8.1(c)_ ( _End Date_ ) and, in either case of
clause (x) or (y), on the Termination Date the only conditions to closing set
forth in _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ that have not been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing
which conditions would be capable of being satisfied at the Closing if the
Closing Date were on the Termination Date) are the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.1(b)_ (but only if the applicable Legal Restraint causing such
condition not to be satisfied is issued under or pursuant to any Antitrust
Law) or _Section 7.1(c)_, then Parent shall pay $150,000,000 (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ ") to the Company (or its designee) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, at or prior to the time of termination in the
case of a termination by Parent, or as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and, in any event, within two Business Days following such termination) in
the case of a termination by the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
shall not be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee to the Company if (x)
the applicable Legal Restraint giving rise to such termination pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)_ or (y) the failure of the conditions in _Section 7.1(b)_ or
_Section 7.1(c)_, as applicable, to have been satisfied resulted from any
breach by the Company of a covenant set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or Parent be required
to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



 

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if a
Party fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.2_,
and the other Party commences a Proceeding that results in a judgment against
the failing Party for the amount set forth in this _Section 8.2_ or a portion
thereof, the failing Party shall pay to the other Party all fees, costs and
expenses of enforcement (including attorneys fees as well as expenses
incurred in connection with any such action), together with interest on such
amount or such portion thereof at the prime lending rate as published in the
_Wall Street Journal_ , in effect on the date such payment is required to be
made.

 



     

 

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to each Partys rights expressly set forth in _Section 9.12_, each
Party expressly acknowledges and agrees that, (i) if this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ ( _Superior
Proposal_ ) and the Company Termination Fee is paid to Parent or its
designees, then the payment to Parent or its designees of the Company
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger
Sub for any loss suffered by Parent or Merger Sub as a result of a breach by
the Company of its obligations under _Section 6.1_; and (ii) if the Parent
Termination Fee is paid to the Company pursuant to this Agreement, then the
payment to the Company or its designees of the Parent Termination Fee shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company for any loss suffered by the
Company as a result of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations
under _Section 6.4_.

 



 

SECTION 8.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each
Party shall bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall
pay all filing fees required under the HSR Act with respect to the

agreement on terms (including standstill restrictions, _provided_ that such

counterparty thereto than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement as
in effect immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (except for
such changes necessary in order for the Company to be able to comply with its

"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein," "hereto," "hereby" and

otherwise requires. References to a person are also to its successors and
permitted assigns. When calculating the period of time before which, within
which or following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded, and if the last day of such period is not a Business Day,
the period shall end on the immediately following Business Day. References to
"days" shall mean "calendar days" unless expressly stated otherwise. Unless
otherwise indicated, documents, materials and information are deemed to have

or information were (a) included in the Data Room on or prior to 6:00 p.m.
