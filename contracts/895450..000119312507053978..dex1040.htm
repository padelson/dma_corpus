2.3 Adjustment to Purchase Price. The Closing Purchase Price was determined

adjustment as follows:

(a) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser will cause the Company to
prepare and provide to both Parties the Closing Balance Sheet and the Working
Capital Statement.

(b) The Working Capital Statement and any associated Purchase
Price adjustment shall become final and binding upon the Parties 30 days
following the delivery to Seller of the Working Capital Statement, unless,
within said 30-day period, Seller notifies Purchaser of its objection thereto
in writing, which objection may only be that the Working Capital Statement
was not properly prepared or computed in accordance with this Agreement. Any
notice of objection shall specify in reasonable detail the reasons for
objection. If Seller so notifies Purchaser of its objection to the Working
Capital Statement, Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve any differences. If, within 30 days following the giving of such
notice by Seller (the "Resolution Period"), any of such differences have not
been resolved, then either Purchaser or Seller may submit the dispute to the
Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm will conduct its
own review and evaluate those items or amounts in the Working
Capital Statement relevant to the calculation of the Current Assets, Current
 



 

10  Liabilities and Working Capital as of the Closing Date and shall determine
only those items still in dispute at the end of the Resolution Period and
shall determine whether such items have been prepared in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. The Independent Accounting Firm will be granted
reasonable access to all records of the Company and the Subsidiaries necessary
for the conduct of such review, and the Parties agree to follow such
procedures and make such submissions to the Independent Accounting Firm as it
may request in conducting its review and making its determination under this
Section 2.3(b). If so requested by the Independent Accounting Firm, each
Party agrees to execute a reasonable engagement letter. The Independent
Accounting Firms determination shall be made within 45 days after its
engagement, or as soon thereafter as possible, shall be set forth in a
written statement delivered to Purchaser and Seller and shall become final,
conclusive, non-appealable and binding for all purposes hereunder upon
delivery to Purchaser and Seller. The determination of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall not be deemed an award subject to review under any
statute. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm in resolving
any differences pursuant to this Section 2.3(b) shall be paid by the Parties
as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm, which determination shall
be made based on the resolution of the disputed items and the relative degree
of success of each Party in such disputes.

(c) Within three business days after the Working Capital Statement becomes
binding and conclusive on the Parties pursuant to Section 2.3(b), either (i)
Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount by which Working Capital, as
reflected on the final Working Capital Statement, exceeds the Target Working
Capital, or (ii) Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount by which Working

provided, however, that prior notice shall be required but prior approval
shall not be required where such release or announcement is required by
applicable law, securities regulations or stock exchange rules; and provided
further, that either Seller, the Company or Purchaser may respond to inquiries
by the press or others regarding the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, so long as such responses are consistent with such partys
previously issued press releases.

5.3 Payment of Expenses. Each Party shall bear its own expenses incurred in
connection with the transaction contemplated herein, including all fees and
expenses of agents, representatives, counsel and accountants engaged by it.

5.4 Non-Compete. For a period of 10 years from the date hereof, except
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, neither Seller nor any of its
subsidiaries shall be engaged either in or in respect of Nigeria whether
directly or indirectly in any business of the kind carried on hitherto by any
of the Subsidiaries relating to Nigeria. 

5.5 Compliance with Law and Rules. The Parties acknowledge that Seller and all
of its employees, officers, directors and representatives are subject to the
United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 ("FCPA") and that,
accordingly, all of Purchasers activities under or in connection with this
Agreement are subject to the requirements of the FCPA. Purchaser warrants
that it has read and understands the full text of the FCPA. Purchaser
certifies that, in connection with the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement: (i) its conduct is consistent with the FCPA and (ii) it has not
engaged in any conduct contrary to the FCPA.

5.6 Further Assurances. Seller agrees that, from time to time after
the Closing Date, it will execute and deliver such further instruments of
conveyance and transfer and take such other action as Purchaser may reasonably
request in order more effectively to convey and transfer to Purchaser the
Shares.

5.7 Confidentiality. The Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect following the execution of this Agreement until terminated as
described therein and is hereby incorporated herein by reference and shall
constitute a part of this Agreement for all purposes. Any and all information
received by Purchaser pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Agreement
shall be governed by the applicable terms and provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

5.8 Preservation of Files and Records. For a period of seven years after the
Closing Date: (a) Purchaser shall preserve all files and records relating to
the Company that are less than seven years old and that relate to any period
prior to the Closing Date, shall allow Seller or its designee reasonable
access to such files and records and the right to make copies and extracts
therefrom at any time during normal business hours and shall not dispose of
any thereof without first offering them to Seller; and (b) Seller
shall preserve all files and records relating to the Company that are less
than seven years old and that are retained by Seller, shall allow Purchaser or
its designee reasonable access to such files and records relating to the
Company as may be in Sellers possession and the right to make copies and
extracts therefrom at any time during normal business hours and shall not
dispose of any thereof without first offering them to Purchaser.



 

24 5.9 Insurance. The Parties acknowledge that, as of the Closing Date, all
insurance coverage maintained by Seller or others (other than the Company and
the Subsidiaries) covering the Company and/or the Subsidiaries may be
terminated and cancelled; provided, however, Seller will use reasonable
efforts to arrange for the continuation of such insurance coverage for a
period ending on February 28, 2007, at Purchasers cost.

5.10 Tominco. Seller has arranged for the acquisition by Purchasers nominee
of all of the equity interests in WNL and WONL not currently owned by WWAI,
effective as of the Closing Date, for a total purchase price of
U.S.$10,500,000, one-half payable at the Closing Date and the balance payable
180 days after the Closing Date. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate with
each other to complete this transaction. Seller shall make such payments or
shall cause such payments to be made.

ARTICLE VI

INDEMNIFICATION AND THIRD PARTY CLAIMS

6.1 Indemnification.

(a) Each of Seller and Purchaser (each an "Indemnifying Party") shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party, and its directors,
officers, employees and Affiliates (hereinafter, collectively, "related
persons"), from and against all demands, claims, actions or causes of action,
assessments, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel (collectively, "Damages") asserted
against, resulting to, imposed upon or incurred by such other Party or such
other Partys related persons (each an "Indemnified Person"), to the extent
resulting from (i) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty
of the Indemnifying Party contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or
(ii) the breach of any covenant of the Indemnifying Party contained in or
made pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) In addition, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser,
its related persons, the Company and the Subsidiaries from and against all
Damages arising out of or in respect of (i) the Investigations, save and
except for Damages in the Federal Republic of Nigeria or elsewhere in West
Africa relating to the Investigations, and (ii) the U.S. litigation set forth
in Section 4.1(o) of the Disclosure Schedule, which, in each case, shall be
managed by Seller.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 6.1(b), Purchaser hereby waives irrevocably
and without reservation any right to any Claim against Seller, or any
Affiliate of Seller, for indemnification and/or for Damages of any kind or
character if such item, event or circumstance is disclosed in the Disclosure
Schedule, except to the extent of any material inaccuracy or fraudulent
misrepresentation made therein.

6.2 Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event any Claim is asserted against
any Indemnified Person by a third party, the Indemnified Person shall, with
reasonable promptness, notify the Indemnifying Party of such Claim. If the
Indemnified Person does not so notify the  



 

25  Indemnifying Party within 15 days after becoming aware of such Claim, then
the Indemnifying Party shall, if such delay materially prejudices the
Indemnifying Party with respect to the defense of such Claim, be relieved of
liability hereunder in respect of such Claim to the extent of the damage
caused by such delay. In any such proceeding, following receipt of notice
properly given, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its sole
discretion, to assume the entire defense of such Claim (with counsel selected
by it which is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person or Persons),
and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the entire cost of defending such
Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to settle any such
Claim without the written consent of the Indemnified Person or Persons, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event of the assumption of
the defense by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable for any further legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Persons in connection with such defense unless otherwise agreed to
in writing by the Indemnifying Party or as herein provided; provided,
however, the Indemnified Persons shall have the right to participate in such
defense, at their own cost, and shall have the obligation to cooperate
therewith.

6.3 Limits on Indemnity Obligations.

(a) No Indemnified Person shall be entitled to seek indemnification from any
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article VI with respect to any Claim
unless such Indemnified Person notifies such Indemnifying Party of such Claim
within one year after the Closing Date; provided, however, such time limit
shall not apply to Claims under Section 6.1(b).

(b) If the total amount of all Claims (each of which individually involves
more than U.S.$100,000 in amount) which Purchaser or any of its related
persons has the right to assert against Seller under this Article
VI ("Purchaser Claims") does not exceed the aggregate amount of
U.S.$1,000,000 (the "Basket"), then Seller shall have no obligation under this
Article VIII with respect to any such Claim, except that the Basket shall not
apply to Claims involving title to the Shares or intentional or fraudulent
material misrepresentations or omissions. If the total amount of all Purchaser
Claims exceeds the Basket, then Sellers obligations under this Article VIII
shall be limited to the amount by which the aggregate amount of all Purchaser
Claims exceeds the Basket. The Basket shall not apply to Claims under Section
6.1(b).

(c) Sellers obligations under this Article VI shall be limited to an
aggregate maximum amount equal to 10 percent of the Purchase Price, except
that such limitation shall not apply to Claims involving title to the Shares
or intentional or fraudulent material misrepresentations or omissions, and/or
Claims under Section 6.1(b).

(d) The amount of any indemnification provided under this Article VI shall be
net of any amounts actually recovered under insurance policies and shall be
adjusted to take account of the present value, discounted at a rate equal to
the Reference Rate in effect at the time such calculation is required to be
made, of any tax benefit or burden actually recognized or incurred by
the Indemnified Person as a result of such indemnification payment and the
event giving rise thereto.



 

26 (e) Seller shall not have any liability for any misrepresentation or breach of
warranty if and to the extent that the Claim resulting from such
misrepresentation or breach of warranty is covered by an adjustment to the
Closing Purchase Price, whether or not such liabilities, issues or problems
arise inside or outside of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

(f) Seller shall not have any liability for client-related liabilities, issues
or problems arising out of or in respect of matters that are the subject
matter of the Investigations.

6.4 Remedy. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchasers and Sellers remedy for any breach of any of the provisions of
Article IV or V, whether expressed as a claim for indemnification, breach of
contract or otherwise, shall be subject to the procedures and limitations set
forth in this Article VI, excluding, however, any cause of action for specific
performance.

6.5 Survival. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made
in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered in connection
herewith shall be in full force and effect notwithstanding any investigation
made by or disclosure made to any Party, whether before or after the date
hereof, shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and shall
survive the Closing and continue to be applicable and binding thereafter for a
period of one year after the Closing Date, at which time the same shall
terminate and be extinguished.

ARTICLE VII

MISCELLANEOUS

7.1 Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of England exclusively

With respect to any disagreement, dispute, controversy or claim arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or any interpretation of this Agreement, and

whatsoever nature, in connection with this Agreement or the subject matter

matter hereof until such time as there has been a complete disposition of the
matter in the High Court of England and Wales in London, England.

7.2 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
each of which shall be an original, but all of which together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by either of the Parties
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Party. Subject to the

benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors

written notice of such change to the other Party in accordance with this
Section 7.5.

7.6 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time only
by a written instrument signed by each of the Parties.

7.7 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

7.8 Waivers. At any time prior to or after the Closing Date, either Party may,
to the extent legally allowed: (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) waive
performance of any of the covenants or agreements, or satisfaction of any of
the conditions,  



 

29  contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed
on behalf of such Party. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action
taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf
of either Party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party taking
such action of compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by either Party of a breach
of any provision hereof shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any
prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof.

7.9 Enforcement of this Agreement. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with the terms hereof, the Parties
hereby recognize and agree that irreparable damage will necessarily occur and,
notwithstanding Section 7.1, the Party affected thereby shall be entitled to
apply to the High Court of England and Wales for an injunction to prevent
such breach, or continuing breach, of this Agreement and/or specific
performance of the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other
remedy available under English law, including those prescribed by Section 44
of the English Arbitration Act 1996. The Parties agree that any application to
the High Court of England and Wales made hereunder shall be one of urgency,
and legal proceedings may be immediately commenced in the English
Court notwithstanding that the Dispute Resolution procedure prescribed below
has yet to be initiated. Any injunction or order so issued shall be
enforceable in any court having jurisdiction over the Parties.

7.10 Dispute Resolution.

(a) Subject to Section 7.9, any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of,
in relation to or in connection with this Agreement, including any dispute as
to the existence, construction, validity, interpretation, enforceability
or breach of representation of this Agreement ("Dispute"), shall be
exclusively and finally settled with no right of appeal, as set forth in this
Section 7.10.

(b) Should the Parties be unable to resolve the Dispute within seven days
after written notice of the Dispute being served on the other Party, or after
such other period of time as mutually agreed by the Parties, then either Party
may initiate binding arbitration by giving written notice to the other Party.

(c) The arbitration will be administered by the London Court of International
Arbitration (the "LCIA") using the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law, but expressly excluding any discovery,
documentary disclosure or similar process (the "UNCITRAL Rules"), except as
the Parties shall otherwise mutually agree. The LCIA is hereby designated as
the appointing authority. The place of arbitration shall be London, England,
and the language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English.

(d) The arbitration shall be conducted by a sole arbitrator. Procedure for
selection of the arbitrator shall be in accordance with the pertinent
articles of the UNCITRAL Rules.



 

30 (e) The arbitrator shall be fluent in the English language and shall at all
times remain wholly independent, fair and impartial regarding the Dispute and
the Parties.

(f) The Parties agree that the Dispute should be resolved as speedily as
possible. Therefore, any time limits specified in the UNCITRAL Rules shall be
strictly complied with and the award should be issued by the arbitrator within
three months of the commencement of the proceedings, or as soon thereafter as
possible.

(g) The arbitrator shall give a reasoned award in writing and any award shall
be final and binding. The Parties expressly agree to exclude any right of
appeal or (except for enforcement or confirmation or application pursuant to
Section 7.9) reference to any court. The arbitration award may be enforced by
judgment or otherwise in any court having jurisdiction over the award or
person or the assets of the owing Party. Applications may be made to such
court for judicial recognition of the award and/or an order of enforcement, as
the case may be.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be executed as a
Deed by their duly authorized representatives as of the date first
above written.
