iii      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") made
and entered into as of this 31st day of May, 2004 by and among General
Electric Company, a New York corporation ("Parent"), Casey Acquisition
Company, a Delaware corporation which is wholly owned by Parent
("Purchaser"), and BHA Group Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Purchaser and the
Company have each determined that it is in the best interests of their
respective stockholders for Parent to acquire the Company upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein;   WHEREAS, in furtherance of
such acquisition, the Boards of Directors of Purchaser and the Company have
each approved the merger (the "Merger") of Purchaser with and into the
Company in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein; and   WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and as a condition and inducement to the willingness of
Parent to enter into this Agreement, Parent and certain stockholders of the
Company are entering into a voting agreement (the "Voting Agreement") in the
form attached as Exhibit B hereto, pursuant to which such stockholders have
agreed to vote to approve the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Voting Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, the parties
hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]    
ARTICLE II   THE MERGER   Section 2.1 Merger; Surviving Corporation. In
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the DGCL, at the
Effective Time, Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company, and the
Company shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes called the
"Surviving Corporation") and shall continue its corporate existence under the
laws of the State of Delaware. At the Effective Time the separate corporate
existence of Purchaser shall cease. All properties, franchises and rights
belonging to Purchaser and the Company, by virtue of the Merger and without
further act or deed, shall be deemed to be vested in the Surviving
Corporation, which shall thenceforth be responsible for all the liabilities
and obligations of each of Purchaser and the Company.   Section 2.2
Certificate of Incorporation. The Company Certificate of Incorporation, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated
in the Merger to be in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto with an
effective time as of the Effective Time and, as so amended and restated, at
the Effective Time and without any further action on the part     of the
Company or Purchaser such certificate of incorporation shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.   Section 2.3
By-Laws. At the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of
the Company or Purchaser, the by-laws of Purchaser in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation
until altered, amended or repealed as provided therein and in the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.   Section 2.4 Directors and
Officers. In accordance with Section 5.15, the directors of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall submit their resignations to be
effective as of the Effective Time. The directors of Purchaser immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until the earlier
of their resignation or removal or their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed (as the case may be) and qualified.   Section 2.5
Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective at the time of filing of a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the DGCL, or at such later time specified as the effective time in the
Certificate of Merger, which Certificate of Merger shall be so filed as
soon as practicable after the meeting of stockholders contemplated in Section
3.16 and the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VI. The time when the Merger shall become effective is
referred to herein as the "Effective Time." Prior to such filing, a closing
shall be held at the offices of King and Spalding LLP, 1185 Avenue of Americas,
New York, NY 10036, or such other place as shall be agreed to by the parties,
for the purpose of confirming the satisfaction or waiver, as the case may be,
of the conditions set forth in Article VI.   Section 2.6 Conversion of
Shares of Company Common Stock. (a) Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") together with
the associated rights attached thereto (the "Company Rights") issued pursuant
to the Rights Agreement, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Sections
2.6(b) and 2.6(c) and Appraisal Shares) shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into,
exchanged for and represent the right to receive $38.00 per share of Company
Common Stock (including the associated Company Right) in cash (the "Merger
Consideration"), payable, without interest, to the holder of such share of
Company Common Stock, upon surrender, in the manner described below, of the
certificate that formerly evidenced such share of Company Common Stock.  
(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time which is then owned beneficially and of record by
Parent or any of its Affiliates shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and
cease to exist, without any conversion thereof.   2    (c) Each share of
Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, be cancelled and retired
and cease to exist, without any conversion thereof.   (d) Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 2.6 to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock
which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
which are held by any stockholders of the Company who have not voted such
shares in favor of the Merger and who shall have properly exercised their
rights of appraisal for such shares in the manner provided in Section 262 of
the DGCL ("Appraisal Shares") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable
for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively waived,
withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL. If
such holder shall have so failed to perfect or shall have effectively waived,
withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, his
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into and to have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time,
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of
any shares of Company Common Stock (and shall also give Parent prompt notice
of any withdrawals of such demands for appraisal rights), and Parent shall
have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demands. Neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for appraisal
rights. Stockholders of the Company who shall have perfected their right of
appraisal and not waived, withdrawn or otherwise lost such right
of appraisal, shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
the shares of Company Common Stock held by them in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL.   Section 2.7 Purchaser Common
Stock. Each share of Purchaser common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Purchaser or any holder thereof, be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of Surviving
Corporation common stock. From and after the Effective Time, each outstanding
certificate theretofore representing shares of Purchaser common stock shall
be deemed for all purposes to evidence ownership of and to represent the
number of shares of Surviving Corporation common stock into which such shares
of Purchaser common stock shall have been converted. Promptly after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall issue to Parent a
stock certificate or certificates representing shares of Surviving
Corporation common stock in exchange for the certificate or certificates that
formerly represented an equal number of shares of Purchaser common stock,
which shall be surrendered by Parent and cancelled.   Section 2.8 Surrender
of Company Common Stock. (a) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent for the benefit of
the stockholders of the Company, such amount of cash as shall be payable in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section
2.6 hereof upon surrender of the Certificates. Such funds shall be invested
by the Paying Agent as directed by the Parent.   (b) As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, but in no event later than 5 calendar days after
the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of
record    3   (other than to holders of Company Common Stock to be
cancelled as set forth in Section 2.6(b) or 2.6(c) or Appraisal Shares) of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates")
(i) a form letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.   (c) Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other agreements as the Paying
Agent shall reasonably request, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration (net of all
applicable withholding taxes), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.8(c), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect
to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby. No
interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon
the surrender of any Certificate.   (d) Any amounts of cash delivered or
made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.8 and not
exchanged for Certificates within 6 months after the Effective Time pursuant
to this Section 2.8 shall be returned by the Paying Agent to Parent.
Thereafter, all holders of unsurrendered Certificates under this Article II
shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof
with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a share of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration
delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law.   (e) If any payment of
the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than that in which
the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish
to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid
or is not applicable.   (f) After the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Article II.   (g) If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and indemnifying the Surviving Corporation against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, which
indemnification obligation, if reasonably    4   requested by the
Surviving Corporation, shall be secured by an indemnification bond, the
Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration.   Section 2.9 Company Stock Options.
(a) Prior to the Effective Time the Company (i) shall take all actions
necessary to cause all outstanding options to acquire Company Common Stock,
including "phantom" stock options, whether or not vested (the "Company Stock
Options"), to be cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for a payment by
Parent to each holder of such Company Stock Options in cash equal to (x) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price for the
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
multiplied by (y) number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such
Company Stock Option shall not theretofore have been exercised, less all
applicable deductions and withholdings with respect to such payment under the
Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and under
any provision of any applicable state, local or foreign tax law. Such cash
payment shall be made as soon after the Effective Time as shall be
practical.   (b) The Company shall take such steps as may be
reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause dispositions of Company
equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated
January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters.   Section 2.10
Adjustments. If during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Company Common Stock, shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares of Company Common Stock, or any similar transaction, or any stock
dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the
Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such
change.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY  
The Company represents and warrants to the Parent and Purchaser (except as
set forth in the written disclosure schedule (with specific reference to the
particular section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information
set forth in such disclosure schedule relates, except to the extent a matter
is disclosed in such a way as to make its relevance to the information called
for by another section or subsection readily apparent; for the avoidance of
doubt, any matter included in such disclosure schedule shall not be
deemed disclosed for purposes of the definition of Material Adverse Effect to
the extent that any additional or different state of facts, change,
development, circumstance, event or effect occurs, or becomes known, relating
directly or indirectly to such matter after the date of this Agreement)
delivered by the Company to Parent and Purchaser in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"))
as follows:   5    Section 3.1 Organization, Standing and Corporate
Power. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite corporate power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to
conduct its business as presently conducted. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions in which the failure to
be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has made available to
Parent true and complete copies of its certificate of incorporation, as
amended, supplemented, modified or restated through the date of this
Agreement (including any and all certificates of designations
attached thereto, the "Company Certificate of Incorporation") and bylaws, as
amended, supplemented, modified or restated through the date of this
Agreement (including any and all amendments thereto the "Company Bylaws") and
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational
documents, each as amended, supplemented, modified or restated through the
date of this Agreement (or equivalent organizational documents) of each
Subsidiary. The Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Company Bylaws and
such other certificates of incorporation, bylaws or equivalent organizational
documents for the Subsidiaries are in full force and effect, and neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary is in violation of any provision of its
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or equivalent organizational documents.
The Company has made available to Parent and its representatives correct and
complete copies of the minutes (or, in the case of minutes that have not yet
been finalized, drafts thereof) of all meetings of stockholders, the Board of
Directors of the Company and each committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries held since October 1, 2000 through the
date of this Agreement.   Section 3.2 Capital Structure. The authorized
capital stock of the Company consists of 20,000,000 shares of Company Common

nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, (ii) 2,789,848 shares of Company
Common Stock are held in the treasury of the Company, (iii) 898,924 shares of

278,985 shares of Company Common Stock are reserved for issuance in
connection with the Company Rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement
dated as of December 13, 1995, between the Company and Boatmen\'s Trust
Company (as amended, the "Rights Agreement"). There are not any bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company having the right to
vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the
right to vote) on any matters on which holders of Company Common Stock may
vote ("Voting Company Debt"). Schedule 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of the outstanding Company Stock
Options with the exercise prices thereof, the name of the holder thereof, the
number of options that are vested and the number of Shares into which the
outstanding Company Stock Options may be exercised. Except as set forth above
or on Schedule 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no
options, warrants, convertible securities, subscriptions, stock appreciation
rights, phantom stock plans or stock equivalents or other rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments (contingent or otherwise)    6   of any
character issued or authorized by the Company or any Subsidiary relating to
the issued or unissued capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary
or obligating the Company or any Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of
capital stock of, or options, warrants, convertible or exchangeable
securities, subscriptions or other equity interests in, the Company or any
Subsidiary or any Voting Company Debt. All shares of Company Common Stock
subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions
specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except as set
forth on Schedule 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no
outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Company Common Stock or
any other capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary or to pay any
dividend or make any other distribution in respect thereof or to provide
funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution
or otherwise) in, any Person.   Section 3.3 Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.3 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of each
of the Company\'s Subsidiaries as of the date hereof. All the outstanding
shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each Subsidiary of
the Company have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and
are owned directly or indirectly by the Company or a Subsidiary, free and
clear of all Encumbrances. Except for the capital stock or other ownership
interests of its Subsidiaries and as disclosed on Schedule 3.3 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof, the Company does not beneficially
own directly or indirectly any capital stock, membership interest,
partnership interest, joint venture interest or other equity interest in any
Person.   Section 3.4 Authority. (a) The Company has the requisite corporate
power and corporate authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, subject to the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval in connection with the Merger. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company (including the unanimous approval
of the Board of Directors of the Company), and no other corporate proceedings
on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than, with
respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger by the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and the filing and
recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL). This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by each of the other parties
hereto, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
similar Laws affecting creditors\' rights and remedies generally, and
subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including
principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in
equity).   (b) The Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting
duly called and held, has (w) determined that this Agreement, the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of
the holders of Company Common Stock, (x) approved and    7   adopted
this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby,
(y) consented to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger,
for purposes of the Rights Agreement, and has acknowledged that the Rights
Agreement shall not apply in connection with such transactions and (z)
recommended that such stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Company Recommendation").   Section
3.5 Compliance with Laws; Licenses, Permits and Registrations. (a) Except as
set forth on Schedule 3.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of, or has violated, any
applicable provisions of any United States federal, state or local or any
foreign statute, law, rule, regulation, ordinance, code, order, judgment or
decree (including any Law relating to Export Control Requirements,
improper payments and anti-boycotting) (a "Law"). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, except as set forth on Schedule 3.5(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries is a
party to any contract or bid with, or has conducted business with (directly
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, indirectly), a third party located in
Cuba, Myanmar (Burma), Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Libya or Sudan. Since October
1, 2001, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made or has been
ordered to make any payment in respect of Governmental Damages. Since October
1, 2001, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written
notice that a Governmental Authority claimed or alleged that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries was not in compliance in a material respect with any
Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their
material properties or other assets or any of their businesses or operations
(including those Laws relating to Export Control Requirements, improper
payments and anti-boycotting). For purposes of this Agreement, "Governmental
Damages" means (i) any penalties or fines paid by the Company or any of is
Subsidiaries to a Governmental Authority or (ii) any restitution paid by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a third party, in each case, resulting
from the (x) conviction (including as a result of the entry of a guilty plea,
a consent judgment or a plea of nolo contendre) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of a crime or (y) settlement with or payments to a Governmental
Authority for the purpose of closing an investigation by a Governmental
Authority for the purpose of imposing criminal sanctions on the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.   (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.5(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has all
permits, licenses, approvals, franchises, certificates, authorizations of
and registrations with and under all Laws, and from all Governmental
Authorities required by the Company and its Subsidiaries to carry on their
respective businesses as now being conducted, including the manufacture and
sale of their respective products (collectively, "Permits"), except where the
failure to have any such Permits, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. Since October 1, 2001, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received written notice that a Governmental Authority was
considering the amendment, termination, revocation or cancellation of any
Permit. The Company and its Subsidiaries are (and since October 1, 2001 have
been) in compliance in all material respects with the terms of all Permits.
The consummation of the Merger, in and of itself, will not cause the
revocation or cancellation of any Permit that is material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.   8    Section 3.6 No Conflicts.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions
hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default
under (with or without notice or lapse of time or both), or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss
of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance upon any of
the properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under (i)
the organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract,
lease or other agreement, commitment or obligation, instrument, permit,
concession, franchise, license or similar authorization applicable to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets
or (iii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in
Section 3.7, any Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses
(ii) and (iii), any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights, losses or
Encumbrances that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to (x) have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company or (y) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 3.7 Consents;
Approvals. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.7 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no license, permit, consent, approval, order or authorization of,
action by or in respect of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required by or with respect to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (i) the filing of
a premerger notification and report form by the Company under the HSR Act and
any applicable filings and approvals under Foreign Antitrust Laws; (ii) the
filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement and the filing of any reports
under the Exchange Act and the rules of The Nasdaq National Market, as may be
required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; (iii) the filing of: (A) the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, and (B) appropriate
documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company
and its Subsidiaries are qualified to do business; and (iv) such other
consents, approvals, orders or authorizations the failure of which to be made
or obtained, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to (x) have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
or (y) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 3.8 Company SEC Documents.   (a)
The Company and each Subsidiary, as necessary, has filed all required
reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits
and all other information incorporated therein) with the SEC since September
30, 2002 (collectively, the "Company SEC Documents"). Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as of their respective
dates, the Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company
SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents when filed (or, if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date     9   of this
Agreement, as of the date of such filing) contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No
investigation by the SEC with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened. The
principal executive officer of the Company and the principal financial
officer of the Company (and each former principal executive officer of the
Company and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made the certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder
with respect to the Company SEC Documents, when applicable. For purposes of
the preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.   (b) The Company\'s principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most
recent evaluation, to the Company\'s auditors and the audit committee of the
Board of Directors of the Company (i) all significant deficiencies in the
design or operation of internal controls that could adversely affect the
Company\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data
and have identified for the Company\'s auditors any material weaknesses in
internal controls and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company\'s
internal controls. The Company has established and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure
that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, is made known to the Company\'s principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer by others within those entities, particularly
during the periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange
Act are being prepared; and, to the Knowledge of the Company, such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the Company\'s
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in the Company\'s periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act.   Section 3.9 Financial Statements. Except
as set forth on Schedule 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
financial statements included in the Company SEC Documents, including any
related notes thereto, comply as to form, as of their respective dates of
filing with the SEC, in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto ("Accounting Rules"), have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of
the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material
respects the respective consolidated financial position of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their respective
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal recurring
year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes if applicable).
Except (i) as reflected in the Company SEC Documents, (ii) for liabilities
incurred in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or (iii) for liabilities incurred after March 31, 2004 in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute,    10   contingent or otherwise) that
would be required to be disclosed on a balance sheet of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries or the footnotes thereto prepared in accordance
with GAAP which, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
Company has made available to Parent a correct and complete summary of any
such disclosure made by management of the Company to the Company\'s auditors
and audit committee since October 1, 2002.   Section 3.10 Absence of Certain
Changes or Events. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents or on
Schedule 3.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since September 30, 2003,
the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses
only in the ordinary course and consistent with prior practice and during
such period there has not been:   (a) any event, change or occurrence of any
condition that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company;   (b) any declaration, setting aside or
payment of any dividend or any other distribution with respect to any of the
capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary or any repurchase for value by
the Company of any capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary;   (c)
any split, combination or reclassification of any capital stock of the
Company or any issuance or the authorization of any issuance of any other
securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of capital
stock of the Company;   (d) any change in accounting methods, principles or
practices employed by the Company, except as may have been required by a
change in GAAP;   (e) (i) any granting by the Company or any Subsidiary to
any director or officer of the Company or any Subsidiary of any increase
in compensation, except in the ordinary course of business or as was required
under employment agreements as of September 30, 2003 and included in the
Company SEC Documents, (ii) any granting by the Company or any Subsidiary to
any such director or officer any rights, warrants or options to acquire any
capital stock or convertible securities or any stock appreciation rights or
phantom stock, except in the ordinary course of business or as was required
under agreements as of September 30, 2003 and included in the Company SEC
Documents, (iii) any granting by the Company or any Subsidiary to any such
director or officer of any increase in severance or termination pay, except
as was required under any employment, severance or termination agreements as
of September 30, 2003 and included in the Company SEC Documents or (iv) any
entry by the Company or any Subsidiary into, or any amendment of, any
employment, severance or termination agreement with any such director or
officer; or   (f) any action of the type described in Section 5.1 which
had such action been taken after the date of this Agreement would be in
violation of any such Section.   Without limiting the foregoing, since
September 30, 2003, there has not occurred any damage, destruction or loss
whether or not covered by insurances of any material asset of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries which materially affects the use thereof.  
11    Section 3.11 Contracts and Commitments.   (a) Except as set forth
in the Company SEC Documents, Schedule 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true, correct and complete list of the following
contracts (written or oral) to which the Company or a Subsidiary is a party
and under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any rights or
obligations, contingent or otherwise, (including every material amendment,
modification or supplement to the foregoing): (i) any contract that would be
required to be filed as an exhibit to a Registration Statement on Form S-1
under the Securities Act or an Annual Report on Form 10-K under the Exchange
Act if such registration statement or report was filed by the Company with
the SEC on the date hereof, (ii) partnership or joint venture agreements,
(iii) any material contracts of employment or consultancy with employees or
contracts with any non-employee representatives or agents, (iv) any contracts
or agreements which limit or restrict the Company or any Subsidiary or any
employee thereof from engaging in any business in any jurisdiction,
(v) agreements for the purchase, sale or lease of any properties or assets
(other than in the ordinary course of business), (vi) all bonds, debentures,
notes, loans, credit or loan agreements or commitments, mortgages, indentures
or guarantees or other agreements or contracts relating to the borrowing of
money involving amounts in excess of $1 million, (vii) agreements with

contracts requiring payments by or to the Company in excess of $200,000 per
year except off-the-shelf software, (xi) any contract providing for
indemnification by the Company or any Subsidiary against any charge of

"Material Contract" and collectively, "Material Contracts"). Except for
agreements or commitments disclosed in the Company SEC Documents or on
Schedule 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement or commitment which is
material to the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The
Company has heretofore made available to Parent complete and correct copies
of each Material Contract in existence as of the date hereof, together with
any and all material amendments and supplements thereto and material "side
letters" and similar documentation relating thereto. To the Company\'s
Knowledge, except as set forth on Schedule 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, none of the contracts to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, and no bid outstanding as of the date of this
Agreement (if accepted or awarded), would result in a Loss Contract, in each
case in the reasonable judgment of the Company\'s management as of the date
of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "Loss Contract" means any
contract with a total contract value in excess of $250,000 that, to the
Knowledge of the Company, has a negative gross margin.     12    (b)
Each Material Contract is valid, binding, in full force and effect and
enforceable in accordance with its terms with respect to the Company and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, with respect to each other party thereto,
except, in each case, to the extent that enforcement of rights and remedies
created by any Material Contracts are subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
application related to or affecting creditors\' rights and to general equity
principles. There are no existing defaults or breaches of the Company under
any Material Contract and, to the Company\'s Knowledge, there are no
such defaults with respect to any third party to any Material Contract. The
Company has no Knowledge of any pending or threatened bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar proceeding with respect to any party to any such agreements.
Schedule 3.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each Material
Contract set forth therein that, to the Knowledge of the Company, requires
the consent of or notice to the other party thereto to avoid any breach,
default, or violation of such contract, agreement or other instrument in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section
3.12 Information Supplied. The Proxy Statement and any other document filed
with the SEC by the Company in connection with the Merger (including each
amendment or supplement thereto) will not, at the time the Proxy Statement or
other document, as the case may be, is filed with the SEC, on the date the
Proxy Statement is first mailed to stockholders of the Company, at
the Effective Time, or, unless promptly corrected, at any time during the
pendency of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting or at the time of the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement and such other
documents filed with the SEC will comply as to form and substance in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect
to information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement.   Section 3.13 Litigation. Except as set forth in
the Company SEC Documents or on Schedule 3.13 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there is no suit, action, claim, grievance, investigation,
indictment or information, or administrative, arbitration or other proceeding
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor is there any judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator
outstanding against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including, in
each case, in connection with an alleged violation of applicable Laws
relating to (i) the export of goods and services to any foreign jurisdiction
against which the United States or the United Nations maintains sanctions or
export controls, including applicable regulations of the US Department of
Commerce and the US Department of State ("Export Control Requirements"), or
(ii) improper payments, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  
Section 3.14 Employee Benefits. (a)(i) Schedule 3.14(a)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, complete and correct list of
(A) each "employee benefit plan" which is subject to the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and provides benefits to
any current or former officer or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary,
(B) each other plan, policy or agreement which provides compensation or
benefits of any kind or description (whether in cash or in kind or in Company
Common Stock or other     13   securities) to any current or former
officer, employee or director of the Company or any Subsidiary who performs
or performed services for the Company or a Subsidiary primarily in the United
States and under which the Company or any Subsidiary has any material
liability (whether contingent or otherwise), and (C) any employment
agreement, change in control agreement, severance agreement or consulting or
similar agreement with any current or former officer, employee, director or
other individual who provides or provided services to the Company or a
Subsidiary primarily in the United States and under which the Company or
any Subsidiary has any material liability (each a "U.S. Benefit Plan"
and collectively the "U.S. Benefit Plans"). The Company has made available a
true, complete and current copy of each U.S. Benefit Plan to Parent together
with a copy of the most recent summary plan description which the Company was
required to provide participants in accordance with ERISA and a copy of any
trust agreement or insurance contract or other funding arrangement related to
such plan.   (ii) Schedule 3.14(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true, complete and correct list of (A) each "employee benefit
plan" which is described in Section 3(3) of ERISA and provides benefits to
any current or former officer or employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary who provides or provided services to the Company or a Subsidiary
primarily outside the United States, (B) each other plan, policy or agreement
which provides compensation or benefits of any kind or description (whether
in cash or in kind or in Company Common Stock or other securities) to any
current or former officer, employee or director of the Company or any
Subsidiary who performs or performed services for the Company or a Subsidiary
primarily outside the United States and under which the Company or any
Subsidiary has any material liability (whether contingent or otherwise), and
(C) any employment agreement, change in control agreement, severance
agreement or consulting or other agreement with any current or former
officer, employee, director or other individual who provides or provided
services to the Company or a Subsidiary primarily outside the United States
and under which the Company or any Subsidiary has any material
liability, except in the case of (A), (B) and (C) for such plans and
arrangements which are established and maintained by a Governmental Authority
or required by the Law of the applicable jurisdiction (each a "Non-U.S.
Benefit Plan" and collectively the "Non-U.S. Benefit Plans"). The Company has
made available a true, complete and current copy of each Non-U.S. Benefit
Plan to Parent together with a copy of any trust agreement or insurance
contract or other funding arrangement related to such plan.   (b) No U.S.
Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and
no U.S. Benefit Plan is a multiemployer plan as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA or a plan which is subject to Section 4063 or Section 4064 of ERISA or
described in Section 413(c) of the Code or is a multiple employer welfare
plan which is described in Section 3(40) of ERISA. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary nor any Person which would be treated as a single employer
together with the Company or a Subsidiary under Section 414 of the Code has
any material liability (whether contingent or otherwise) with respect to any
employee benefit plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA.   (c) There are
two U.S. Benefit Plans which are intended to satisfy the qualification
requirements under Section 401(a) of the Code, the BHA Group Holdings, Inc.
Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the BHA Group Holdings,
Inc. Profit Sharing Plan. Each such plan as in effect is the subject to a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service. To the
Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred since    14   the date
of each such letter that is reasonably likely to adversely affect
the qualification of such plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, and each
such plan satisfies the non-discrimination and other testing requirements
applicable to such plan under the Code.   (d) There have been no prohibited
transactions under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA with
respect to any U.S. Benefit Plan which is subject to the Code or ERISA or any
trust which is a part of any such plan which have not been timely and
properly corrected in full and for which any applicable penalties or, if
applicable, penalties and interest have not been paid in full, except for any
such transactions that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.  
(e) No U.S. Benefit Plan provides healthcare continuation benefits described
in Section 3(1) of ERISA following a termination of employment except for the
healthcare continuation coverage required under Part 6 of Title I of ERISA,
and the liabilities of any other U.S. Benefit Plan which provides any other
benefits described in Section 3(1) of ERISA following a termination of
employment either are fully provided for or otherwise fully satisfied by one
or more fully paid up insurance policies or annuity contracts with a person
unaffiliated with the Company or any Subsidiary or are reflected on the most
recent consolidate balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference into the
Company SEC Documents.   (f) Any interests in any U.S. Benefit Plan which
are required to be registered under the Securities Act have been timely and
properly so registered and any related prospectus has been properly prepared
and timely delivered to participants in such plan.   (g) To the Company\'s
Knowledge, any individual who performs or who has performed services for the
Company or any Subsidiary and who is or was not classified as an employee of
the Company or such Subsidiary on its payroll and other records for income
tax or other purposes has been or was properly classified as an individual
who is not an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary.   (h) Each U.S.
Benefit Plan and each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan has been maintained in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and with all applicable
provisions of applicable Law, and all reporting and disclosure requirements
under ERISA and the Code applicable to each U.S. Benefit Plan and any similar
requirements under applicable Law with respect to each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan
have been satisfied in all material respects.   (i) All contributions,
premiums and other payments that are required to have been made with respect
to any U.S. Benefit Plan or Non-U.S. Benefit Plan as of the date of this
Agreement have been made, and all such contributions, premiums and other
payments for which the Company or a Subsidiary has accrued an obligation to
make as of the date of this Agreement but which are not due on or before such
date have been reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed
or incorporated by reference into the Company SEC documents. All
contributions, premiums and other payments required under applicable Law to
be made for the benefit of current or former employees of the Company or any
Subsidiary with respect to any plan or program established by
any Governmental Authority have been made in full when due.     15   
(j) All amendments and actions required to bring the U.S. Benefit Plans and
Non-U.S. Benefit Plans into conformity in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Code, ERISA or other applicable Law have been
made or taken except to the extent that such amendments or actions are not
required by Law to be made or taken until a date after the Effective Time or
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (k) The Company has made available
to Parent a copy of the most recently filed Annual Report (Form 5500) and all
related exhibits and reports for each U.S. Benefit Plan which is subject to
ERISA and has made available to Parent a copy of the most recently filed

with respect to any U.S. Benefit Plan and any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan.   (l)
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.14(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) either (i) result in, cause
the acceleration and vesting or delivery of, or increase the amount or value
of, any payment or right or benefit to or for any current or former officer,
employee or director or independent contractor of the Company of any
Subsidiary or (ii) result in any "excess parachute payment" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code.   (m) There are no pending or, to the
Company\'s Knowledge, threatened claims with respect to a U.S. Benefit Plan
or a Non-U.S. Benefit Plan (other than routine and reasonable claims for
benefits made in the ordinary course of the plan\'s operations) or with
respect to the terms and conditions of employment or termination of
employment of any current or former officer, employee or director or
independent contractor of the Company or any Subsidiary which would
reasonably be expected to result in any material liability to the Company or
a Subsidiary, and no audit or other investigation by any domestic or former
government or governmental agency is pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, has been proposed with respect to any U.S. Benefit Plan or
Non-U.S. Benefit Plan.   (n) Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.14(n) of the

Subsidiary outside the United States is represented in his or her capacity as
an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary by any Labor Organization and
(ii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has recognized any labor
organization, nor has any labor organization been elected as the collective
bargaining agent of any employees, nor has the Company or any Subsidiary
entered into any collective bargaining agreement or union contract
recognizing any labor organization as the bargaining agent of any employees.
To the extent that any consultation or other obligations with respect to any
labor organizations arise as a result of or are required to effect
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either under applicable Law
or contract, the Company will fully satisfy all such obligations prior to
the Effective Time. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no union
organization activity involving any employees pending or threatened, nor has
there ever been union representation involving any employees. There is no
picketing pending or,   16   to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened,
and there are no strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts, arbitrations

the Company, threatened that would reasonably be expected to be brought or
filed with any Governmental Authority or arbitrator based on, arising out of,
in connection with, or otherwise relating to the employment or termination of
employment of, or failure by the Company or any Subsidiary to employ, any
individual. The Company and each Subsidiary are in compliance in all material

Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of the following items which the

use any of the Intellectual Property Rights that are owned by the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries, other than those Persons who are authorized
licensees under the Intellectual Property Rights. Except as disclosed on

names, service marks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights owned
or licensed by any other Person. To the Knowledge of the Company, the
business of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as presently conducted,
does not materially conflict with and has not been alleged to materially
conflict with any patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights
or other intellectual property rights of others. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not result in the loss or impairment of
any of the material Intellectual Property Rights or the Company\'s or it\'s

which licensing agreement has been made available to the Parent. To the
Knowledge of the Company, each such license agreement is a valid and binding

to any Business Technology owned or licensed by the Company or any
Subsidiary.   Section 3.16 Voting Requirements. The affirmative vote of the

financial condition on a consolidated basis free and clear of all
Encumbrances except (x) statutory liens securing payments not yet due, (y)
security interests, mortgages and pledges that are disclosed in the Company
SEC Documents and (z) such other imperfections or irregularities of title or
other Encumbrances that, individually or in the aggregate, do not and would

assets subject thereto or otherwise materially impair business operations as
presently conducted or as currently proposed by the Company\'s management to
be conducted, and (ii) is the lessee or sublessee of all leasehold estates
and leasehold interests reflected in the Company SEC Documents (or acquired

Warranties.   (a) All material insurance policies of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (the "Policies") are in full force and effect. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material breach or default, and

failed to take any action which would constitute such a material breach or
default, or permit termination or modification or any of the Policies. No
written notice of cancellation or termination has been received by the
Company with respect to any such Policy (except with respect to Policies that
have been replaced with similar policies). None of the Merger or the

product of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All such existing claims
are fully covered by insurance, except such claims that,   
20   individually or in the aggregate, have not had or would not reasonably
be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (c) Schedule
3.22(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and correct
list of all written warranties, warranty policies, service agreements and
maintenance agreements of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in effect
as of the date of this Agreement that provide for warranty coverage for a
period in excess of 12 months. All products of each of the Company and its

reports have been timely filed, granted and have not expired, except to the

paid (or the Company has paid on its behalf) all Taxes that are material in
amount which are (i) shown as due on such returns or reports, (ii) otherwise

for all unpaid Taxes that are material in amount of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof accrued through the
date of such financial statements. The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the current taxable period do not exceed the reserve for Tax

through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in filing their tax returns and reports.

adjustments, claims or matters in controversy for any Taxes have

examinations or concluded litigation have been paid.   21    (c) There
are no liens for Taxes that are material in amount (other than for current
Taxes not yet due and payable) on the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is bound by any
agreement with respect to Taxes.   (d) No deduction of any amount that would
otherwise be deductible with respect to tax periods ending on or before the
Effective Time could be disallowed under Section 162(m) of the Code, except

Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (e) Neither the Company nor any

Company and its Subsidiaries) under Reg. ss. 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract, or otherwise.   (h) Neither the Company nor any of its

or any Subsidiary) or any other area on which the Company or any Subsidiary
is conducting or has conducted its business or operations from which any
Hazardous Materials were released into the environment (the term "release"
meaning any spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying,

Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the Company\'s and its
Subsidiaries\' respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives
(collectively, "Representatives") to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the return from all such parties or cause
the destruction of all copies of confidential information provided to such
parties by the Company or its Representatives that are still in the
possession of such parties. Except as contemplated by Section 5.18,
the Company shall not release any third party from, or waive any provision
of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Company is a
party. From the date hereof to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or otherwise knowingly
facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or
proposals with respect to or the making or submission of any Takeover
Proposal; or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any
third party regarding, or furnish to any third party any non-public
information in connection with, any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to the date the Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Board
of Directors of the Company and its Representatives may, in any event, have
discussions with and furnish non-public information to any Person that has
made an unsolicited, written Takeover Proposal that was made in circumstances
not otherwise in violation of this Agreement if the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith that there is a reasonable likelihood that
such Takeover Proposal will constitute a Superior Proposal and with respect
to which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith after
considering applicable Law and after consulting with outside counsel, that
the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach by
it of its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders; provided that the
Company may furnish non-public information to such Person only after such
Person has executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company (which
confidentiality agreement shall be no less favorable to the Company (i.e., no
less restrictive in respect of the conduct of such Person) than the
Confidentiality Agreement) and the Company advises Parent, and delivers to
Parent, all such non-public information not previously provided to Parent.  
(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 5.2, the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in writing
(and in no event later than 48 hours), after receipt, if any proposal, offer,
inquiry or other contact is received by, any information is requested from,
or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued
with, the Company in respect of any Takeover Proposal, and shall in any such
notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such Takeover
Proposal and the material terms and conditions of any Takeover Proposals (and
in connection therewith, shall simultaneously provide to Parent copies of any
written Takeover Proposal received by the Company), and thereafter shall keep
Parent informed, on a timely basis and in reasonable detail, of all material
developments affecting the status and terms of any such proposals, offers,
inquiries or requests (and the Company shall provide Parent with copies of
any updated written Takeover Proposals) and of the status of any
such discussions or negotiations.   29    (c) For purposes of this
Agreement, (i) "Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) relating to any (A)
direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series
of related transactions) of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries equal
to 15% or more of the Company\'s consolidated assets or to which 15% or more
of the Company\'s revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are
attributable, (B) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a
single transaction or a series of related transactions) of 15% or more of
capital stock of the Company, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 15% or more of the
capital stock of the Company or (D) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries to which 15% or more of the Company\'s
revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, and (ii)
"Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written proposal or offer from any
Person not obtained in breach of this Agreement to acquire, directly or
indirectly, for consideration involving cash and/or securities, all the
equity securities of the Company or all or substantially all of the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis made by a third
party, which the Board of Directors of the Company determines, reasonably and
in good faith, after consultation with the Company Financial Advisors and
outside counsel, taking into account all factors the Board of Directors of
the Company deems relevant, including the estimated time required to
consummate the offer, the Person making the offer and the legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the offer, is reasonably capable of being
completed and, if consummated, would result in a transaction that is more
favorable to its stockholders from a financial point of view than the
Merger.   (d) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.2(d), neither
the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A)
withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or (B) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal or (ii)
allow, cause or authorize the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of
understanding, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or
other agreement providing for or contemplating the consummation of any
Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement in accordance with
Section 5.2(a)) (each, a "Company Acquisition Agreement"). Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, prior to the date the
Stockholder Approval is obtained, (x) the Board of Directors of the Company
may withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation, or approve or recommend a
Superior Proposal, if such Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
considering applicable Law and after consulting with outside counsel, that
the failure to make such withdrawal, modification or recommendation would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach by the Board of Directors of
the Company of its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders, and (y)
if the Board of Directors of the Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide
Takeover Proposal that was made in circumstances not involving a breach of
this Agreement and that such Board determines in good faith constitutes a
Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in response to
such Superior Proposal and after the expiration of the two Business Day
period described below, enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal but only if the Company shall have concurrently with
entering into such definitive agreement terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(g) and prior thereto or concurrently therewith paid the
Termination Fee    30   required pursuant to Section 7.3, but in any
event (i) only after the second Business Day following the Company\'s
delivery of written notice (the "Notice of Superior Proposal") advising
Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal and terminate
this Agreement (it being understood that the Company shall be required to
deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal in respect of any revised Superior
Proposal (other than immaterial revisions) from such third party or its
Affiliates that the Company proposes to accept), attaching the most current
version of such agreement to such Notice of Superior Proposal (which version
shall be updated on a current basis), and (ii) only if, during such
two Business Day period, the Company and its Representatives shall have
negotiated or offered to negotiate in good faith with Parent and Parent\'s
Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms of this Agreement as
would enable Parent and the Company to proceed with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on such adjusted terms and, at the end of such
two Business Day period, after taking into account any such adjusted terms as
may have been agreed upon by Parent and the Company, since the Company\'s
delivery of such Notice of Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the
Company has again in good faith made the determination referred to above in
this clause (y).   (e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall prohibit
the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company, in connection with a
tender or exchange offer for the Company\'s outstanding securities by a third
party, from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making
any disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders if, in the good faith judgment
of the Board of Directors of the Company, failure so to disclose would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; provided, however,
that, except as provided in Section 5.2(d), neither the Company nor its Board
of Directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw or modify, its position with respect to this Agreement
or the Merger or approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, a Takeover Proposal.   Section 5.3 Further Assurances; Reasonable
Best Efforts (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary, proper and advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, each party shall: (i) make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
Transactions as promptly as practicable and supply as promptly as practicable
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act; (ii) make any additional filings required by any
applicable Competition Law and take all other actions reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act or other Competition Laws, and comply with
applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws, as promptly as practicable; and (iii)
subject to applicable Laws relating to access to and the exchange
of information, use its reasonable best efforts to (A) cooperate with each
other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with
any investigation or other inquiry under or relating to any Competition Law;
(B) keep the other parties informed of any communication received by such
party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the
"FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ") or
any     31   other Governmental Authority and of any communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding any of the Transactions; and (C) permit the other parties
hereto to review in advance any communication intended to be given by it to,
and consult with the other parties in advance of any meeting or conference
with, the FTC, the DOJ or any such other Governmental Authority, and to the
extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental
Authority, give the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate
in such meetings and conferences.   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates be obligated to propose or agree to accept any
undertaking or condition, enter into any consent decree, make any
divestiture, accept any operational restriction or take or commit to take any
action that would reasonably be expected to limit: (i) the freedom of action
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates with respect to the operation of,
or Parent\'s ability to retain, the Company or any businesses, product lines
or assets of the Company or (ii) Parent\'s or its Subsidiaries\' or
Affiliates\' ability to retain, own or operate any portion of the businesses,
product lines or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates,
or alter or restrict in any way the business or commercial practices of
Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the Company or its
Subsidiaries.   (c) For purposes hereof, "Competition Laws" means the
Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other applicable Laws
issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization
or restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or
acquisition.   Section 5.4 Employee Benefit Plans. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to either maintain the U.S. Benefit Plans and Non-U.S.
Benefit Plans (which for purposes of this Section 5.4 only, includes plans
and arrangements for the benefit of non-United States employees and agents of
the Company and its Subsidiaries currently in place) (other than the BHA
Group Holdings, Inc. Amended and Restated Employee Stock Ownership Plan, the
BHA Group Holdings, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan and equity-based arrangements)
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time or
replace all or any such programs with programs maintained for similarly
situated employees of the Parent or its Affiliates in accordance with
Parent\'s standard policies and practices (each a "Surviving Corporation
Plan"). To the extent that any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries
becomes an employee of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time and
thereafter participates in a Surviving Corporation Plan, the Surviving
Corporation shall grant, or cause to be granted, service credit to such
employee (in accordance with the service credit rules in such plan) for
his or her service with the Company and its Subsidiaries exclusively for the
purpose of determining eligibility to participate and nonforfeitability of
benefits (other than post-retirement benefits under a plan which is a
"welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA)) and for
purposes of benefit accrual exclusively under vacation and severance pay
plans (but only to the extent such service was credited under similar plans
of the Company and its Subsidiaries).   (a) If a Surviving Corporation Plan
which is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA))
replaces a U.S. Benefit Plan or a Non-U.S. Benefit Plan which is a "welfare
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA)) which provides   
32   healthcare and related benefits (a "Surviving Corporation Welfare
Plan"), the Surviving Corporation shall (i) waive any waiting periods, pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements under the
Surviving Corporation Welfare Plan for a participant and his or her covered
dependants to the extent such provisions were inapplicable to such individual
under the U.S. Benefit Plan or the Non-U.S. Benefit Plan immediately before
such plan was replaced by the Surviving Corporation Welfare Plan and (ii)
provide for credit under the Surviving Corporation Welfare Plan for any
eligible expenses paid by any participant and his or her covered dependents
under the U.S. Benefit Plan or the Non-U.S. Benefit Plan for purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements under the Surviving Corporation Welfare Plan to the same extent
the participant and his or her covered dependants would have received credit
for paying such expenses if such expenses had been paid made under the
Surviving Corporation Welfare Plan.   (b) Subject to compliance by the
Surviving Corporation with its obligations under Section 5.4(a) and 5.4(b),
nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall be construed to prevent the
termination of employment of any individual employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or any changes in the employee benefits available to any such
individual employee or the amendment or termination of any particular U.S.
Benefit Plan or Non-U.S. Benefit Plan to the extent permitted by its terms as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.   Section 5.5 Certain
Notifications. At all times from the date hereof until the Effective Time,
each party shall promptly notify the others in writing of the occurrence of
(i) any event which will or may result in the failure to satisfy the
conditions specified in Article VI, (ii) any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or from any person
alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required and (iii) the
occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of any event which would be reasonably likely
to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be
materially untrue or inaccurate; provided, however, that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.   Section
5.6 Expenses. Subject to Section 7.3, whether or not the Merger
is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense, except expenses incurred in connection with the
filing fee under the HSR Act shall be equally shared by Parent and the
Company.   Section 5.7 Public Announcements. The initial press release with
respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to
be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Parent and the Company
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated herein and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by Law or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange
to which Parent or the Company is a party.   Section 5.8 Company
Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law
and the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws,
subject     33   to Section 7.1(g), (a) as soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of its

approval and adoption. At the Company Stockholders\' Meeting, Parent and
Purchaser shall cause all shares of Company Common Stock then owned by
them and their Subsidiaries to be voted in favor of the approval and adoption
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing (but subject to Section 7.1(g)), the
Company\'s obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.8
shall not be affected by (x) the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company of any Takeover Proposal or (y)
the withdrawal or modification by the Board of Directors of the Company or
any committee thereof of the Company Recommendation.   Section 5.9 Proxy
Statement. (a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file the Proxy Statement with the
SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) respond to any
comments on the Proxy Statement or requests for additional information from
the SEC with respect thereto as soon as practicable after receipt of any such
comments or requests and (ii) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable following the date
of this Agreement. The Company shall promptly (A) notify Parent upon the
receipt of any such comments or requests and (B) provide Parent with copies
of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. Prior to responding to any such comments or requests or the filing
or mailing of the Proxy Statement, (x) the Company shall provide Parent with
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any drafts of the Proxy
Statement and related correspondence and filings, (y) the Company shall
include in such drafts, correspondence and filings all comments reasonably
proposed by Parent and (z) to the extent practicable, the Company and its
outside counsel shall permit Parent and its outside counsel to participate in
all communications with the SEC and its staff (including all meetings and
telephone conferences) relating to the Proxy Statement, this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to Section 5.2(d), the Proxy
Statement shall include the Company Recommendation and a copy of the written
opinions of the Company Financial Advisors referred to in Section 3.23.  
(b) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event shall occur, or fact
or information shall be discovered by Parent or the Company, that should be
set forth in an amendment of or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the
other parties hereto, and the Company shall, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 5.9(a), prepare and file with the SEC such
amendment or supplement as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable and
to the extent required by applicable Law, cause such amendment or supplement
to be distributed to the stockholders of the Company.   Section 5.10 ESOP
and Profit Sharing Plan. The Company shall amend the BHA Group Holdings, Inc.
Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the BHA    
34   Group Holdings, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan (if necessary) to expressly
provide that each participant shall have the right to direct the trustee of
each such plan on how to vote such participant\'s Shares at the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting to adopt this Agreement and to approve the Merger.  
Section 5.11 Access to Information; Confidentiality. Subject to the existing
confidentiality agreement dated as of March 25, 2004 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), among Parent, Purchaser and the Company, upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to
Parent and to its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours to all their properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and
records and, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, furnish promptly to Parent all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request
(including, the opportunity to conduct "Phase II" or other environmental
testing or sampling, provided that Parent\'s representatives shall not
unreasonably interfere with or otherwise disrupt the business or operations
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries while conducting such testing or
sampling). The Company shall use reasonable efforts to obtain from third
parties any consents or waivers of confidentiality restrictions with respect
to any such information being provided by it. No review pursuant to this
Section 5.11 shall have an effect for the purpose of determining the accuracy
of any representation or warranty given by any party hereto to the other
parties hereto. Each of Parent and Purchaser will hold, and will cause its
respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and
other representatives and Affiliates to hold, any non-public information in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.   Section 5.12

respect of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions by them in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (and rights for advancement of expenses) to the extent
provided in (i) the Company Certificate of Incorporation or Company Bylaws as
in effect on the date hereof and (ii) any indemnification or other agreements
of the Company as in effect on the date hereof, which shall survive the
Merger, without further action, and shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms; provided, however that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to indemnify any such person for fraud,
criminal conduct or responsibility for breach of this Agreement.   (b) In
the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause proper provision to be made so that its successors
and assigns assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.12.   (c)
For six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, in effect directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time covering each Person currently     35   covered by
the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy as of the date
hereof (the "Current DandO; Policy") maintained by the Company and
its Subsidiaries on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no
less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof or,
if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance
in excess of $350,000 (which amount represents 200% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for the Current DandO; Policy); provided, further
that Parent may substitute therefor policies of Parent of at least the same
coverage and amount and such other terms which are, in the aggregate, no less
favorable to such directors and officers.   (d) The provisions of this
Section 5.12 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each party currently covered by such insurance or such
indemnification agreements or provisions, his heirs and his representatives
and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise.   Section 5.13 Profit Sharing Plan. The Company shall terminate
the BHA Group Holdings, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan in accordance with its terms
immediately prior to the Effective Time.   Section 5.14 Undertakings of
Parent. Parent shall perform, or cause to be performed, when due all
obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement.   Section 5.15 Director
Resignations. The Company shall cause to be delivered to Parent resignations

The Company shall cause such directors, prior to resignation, to appoint new
directors nominated by Parent to fill such vacancies.   Section 5.16 Rights

hereto. Except as approved in writing by Parent, neither the Company nor the
Board of Directors of the Company shall (i) amend the Rights Agreement, (ii)
redeem the Company Rights or (iii) take action with respect to, or make any
determination under, the Rights Agreement.   Section 5.17 Stockholder
Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in
the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company
and its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Merger; provided, however, that no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parent\'s consent, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld.   Section 5.18 Standstill Agreements; Confidentiality
Agreements. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time
or earlier termination of this Agreement, the Company shall not terminate,
release or waive any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement
to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in connection with the
making of a Takeover Proposal unless, in response to an unsolicited request
to do so from the other party to such agreement that    36   was made
in circumstances not otherwise in violation of Section 5.2, the Board of
Directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel to the Company, that such action is appropriate in order
for the Board of Directors to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.   ARTICLE VI   CONDITIONS   Section 6.1
