disclosed in _Schedule 3.26_ , neither Seller, the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any notice that any such supplier will not sell raw
materials, supplies, merchandise or other goods to the Company or its
Subsidiaries in the future.

  



  

3.27 _Sufficiency of Assets_.

  



  

(a) _Schedule 3.27(a)_ contains a true and complete list of all of the
properties, assets, rights, Contracts and claims of Seller and its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) used or held for
use in, or necessary for, the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as presently conducted, and of all services performed for
the Company and its Subsidiaries by Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than
the Company).

  



  

(b) Following the Closing, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries (other
than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) will have any interest in any
properties, rights and assets used in or relating to the conduct of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted.

  



  

3.28 _Complete Copies of Materials_. The Company has made available to Buyer
true and complete copies of each of the documents listed or referred to on
the Disclosure Schedules.

  



  

3.29 _Grants and Benefits_.   _Schedule 3.29_ provides a list of all material
pending and outstanding grants, incentives, Tax benefits, subsidies and other
similar benefits or incentives, and all applications therefor (collectively,
" _Grants_ "), provided by a Governmental Authority to or for the benefit of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or applicable to or affecting any of
their respective businesses, properties, rights or assets.  The Company
provided to Buyer, prior to the date hereof, true and correct copies of all
documents evidencing Grants submitted by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and all letters of approval and supplements thereto, granted to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. _Schedule 3.29_ sets forth a summary
of the Companys estimated savings and benefits under the Grants for the time
periods and types of savings and benefits specified therein. Except as set
forth on _Schedule 3.29_ , the Company or its Subsidiary, as appropriate, is
in compliance, in all material respects, with the terms and conditions of
their respective Grants and has duly fulfilled, in all material respects, all
the undertakings relating thereto. No submissions made to any Governmental
Authority in connection with obtaining any Grant contained any misstatement
or omission that would have affected the granting of such Grant. As of the
date hereof, the Company has not been informed in writing by a Governmental
Authority that they have any intent to revoke or materially modify any of the
Grants. To the Companys knowledge, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in and of itself will not have any adverse
effect on the continued validity and effectiveness of any such Grants. Each
Subsidiary has, in accordance with applicable Law, duly registered with the
relevant Governmental Authority and obtained and maintained the validity of
all national and local tax registration certificates. To the Companys
knowledge, the Company has not taken or omitted to take any action that can
reasonably be

  



        
   

  



  

expected to form the basis of any Governmental Authorities rejecting the
renewal or extension of the Grants with respect to the High-Technology
Enterprise status as the current three-year term of such status is due to
expire.

  



  

3.30 _Director and Officer Claims_. No director or officer of the Company or
its Subsidiaries has made a claim for indemnification pursuant to the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other similar organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other agreement
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and, to the Companys knowledge,
no basis for any such claim exists. _Schedule 3.30_ sets forth each of the
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Except as set
forth on _Schedule 3.30_ , none of the directors or officers of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is an employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries).

  



  

3.31 _Termination of Intercompany Obligations, Guarantees and Indemnity
Obligations_. As of the Closing Date, Seller has caused to be terminated and
cancelled all (i) intercompany accounts payable by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) and (ii) intercompany accounts payable (other than commercial
accounts payable related to the sale of products or services, if any,
included in the accounts receivable line in the Latest Balance Sheet or that
would be included in a consolidated, unaudited balance sheet of the Company
and its Subsidiaries prepared in the same manner as the Latest Balance Sheet
on the Closing Date) by the Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries) to the Company and its Subsidiaries.
The intercompany payable line on the Latest Balance Sheet is calculated on a
net basis, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the accounts receivable line on
the Latest Balance Sheet does not include such commercial accounts receivable
from MRV and its Subsidiaries (excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries).
As of the Closing Date, Seller has caused to be terminated and cancelled all
indemnity obligations from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to Seller
or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries). None of
the Companys Cash on Hand was used to satisfy any such intercompany accounts
payable on or after September 30, 2010. As of the Closing Date, Seller has
caused the Company and its Subsidiaries to be released from any obligation to
guarantee or provide indemnity for any obligation of Seller and its
Subsidiaries (except the Company and its Subsidiaries) to a third party and
has caused the beneficiaries of any such guarantees or indemnities to release
the Company from any liabilities or obligations under each such guarantee and
indemnity.

  



  

3.32 _No Other Representations_. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in _Article II_ and this _Article III_, as qualified
by the Disclosure Schedules delivered pursuant hereto, and as made in any
certificate delivered at Closing pursuant to this Agreement, none of
the Company, its Subsidiaries, Seller or any other Person makes any express
or implied representation or warranty in respect or on behalf of the Company,
its Subsidiaries or Seller, and the Company and Seller disclaim any
such representation or warranty, whether by Seller, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents or representatives or any other Person, with respect to the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the business or assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to Buyer or any
of its officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives or any other
Person of any documentation or other information with respect to the
foregoing.

ARTICLE V.

  



  

 _COVENANTS OF SELLER AND THE COMPANY_

  



  

5.01 _Access to Books and Records_. After the Closing, Seller shall from time
to time provide Buyer and its authorized representatives (including,
without limitation, its legal advisors and accountants) with reasonable
access, upon advance notice and during normal business hours, to the books
and records relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries in Sellers
possession as Buyer reasonably requests and to make extracts and copies of
such books and records. Effective upon, and only upon, the consummation of
the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. Unless otherwise
consented to in writing by Buyer, Seller shall not, for a period of six years
following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of its
books and records, or any portions thereof, relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries for periods on or prior to the Closing Date without first giving
at least 30 days prior written notice to Buyer and offering to surrender to
Buyer such books and records or such portions thereof.

  



  

5.02 _Confidentiality_.  Seller recognizes that by reason of its ownership of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries) have acquired confidential information and
trade secrets concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company and
its Subsidiaries business the use or disclosure of which could cause Buyer
or its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) substantial
loss and

  



        
   

  



  

damages that could not be readily calculated and for which no remedy at law
would be adequate.  Accordingly, Seller covenants and agrees with Buyer that
neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries will at any time, except in
performance of their respective obligations to Buyer or with the prior
written consent of Buyer, directly or indirectly, disclose any proprietary,
secret or confidential information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the Company and its Subsidiaries business that any such
Person may learn or has learned by reason of its ownership of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and the Company and its Subsidiaries business, unless (i)
such information becomes known to the public generally through no fault of
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) disclosure is required by applicable
Law, or (iii) such information was not previously known to Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries but becomes rightfully known to Seller or such Subsidiary
after Closing, without restriction, from a source (other than Buyer and its
Subsidiaries) not related to Sellers prior ownership of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the Company and its Subsidiaries business and without any
breach of duty to Buyer or its Subsidiaries. The parties hereto agree that
the covenant contained in this _Section 5.02_ imposes a reasonable restraint
on Seller and its Subsidiaries and employees.

  



  

5.03 _Non-Competition_.

  



  

(a) In consideration of Buyer entering into this Agreement and in order that
Buyer may enjoy the full benefit of the business of the Company, for a period
of three (3) years from and after the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly, whether as principal, agent,
partner, officer, director, stockholder, employee, consultant or otherwise,
alone or in association with any other Person, own, manage, operate, control,
participate in, invest in (other than an investment that results in such
Person owning less than 2% of the outstanding voting stock of a publicly
traded company) or carry on a business which, directly or indirectly, is in
competition with the Company or its Subsidiaries as conducted on the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall be allowed to (i) sell the
Appointech, Inc. (" _Appointech_ ") business to any third party or parties
which is not an Affiliate of Seller or its Subsidiaries and (ii) continue
operation of the business of Appointech, without material expansion of or
deviation from the business of Appointech as historically conducted;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that no restrictions pursuant to this
_Section 5.03(a)_ shall apply with respect to Appointech following the
closing of any sale of Appointech to a third party which is not an Affiliate
of Seller or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b) Seller acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law for any breach, or
threatened breach, of any of the provisions of this _Section 5.03_ will be
inadequate and, accordingly, Seller covenants and agrees that Buyer shall, in
addition to any other rights and remedies which Buyer may have at Law, be
entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief, and to the remedy
of specific performance with respect to any breach or threatened breach of
such covenant, as may be available from any court of competent jurisdiction.
In addition, Seller and Buyer agree that the terms of the covenant in this
_Section 5.03_ are fair and reasonable in light of Buyers plans for the
business of the Company and are necessary to accomplish the full transfer of
the goodwill and other intangible assets contemplated hereby.  In the event
that any of the covenants contained in this _Section 5.03_ shall be
determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any
reason whatsoever, then any such provision or provisions shall not be deemed
void, and the parties hereto agree that said limits may be modified by the
court and that said covenant contained in this _Section 5.03_ shall be
amended in

  



        
   

  



  

accordance with said modification, it being specifically agreed by the
parties that it is their continuing desire that this covenant be enforced to
the full extent of its terms and conditions or if a court finds the scope of
the covenant unenforceable, the court should redefine the covenant so as to
comply with applicable Law.

  



  

5.04 _Non-Solicitation_.  For a period of two (2) years after the Closing
Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, whether for
their own account or for the account of any Person, solicit, offer employment
to or hire any individual that is employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries
on the Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall not be prohibited from (i) initiating searches for
employees through the use of general advertisement or through the engagement
of firms to conduct searches that are not targeted or focused on the Company
and its Subsidiaries (and the hiring of employees that respond to any such
searches), (ii) hiring any such employee not employed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries at the time of solicitation or (iii) hiring any employee who
contacts Seller or its Subsidiaries on his or her own initiative.

  



  

5.05 _Successors_. In the event that Seller (or any of its successors or
assigns) shall (i) consolidate or merge with any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger, (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any other Person, or (iii) adopt a plan of dissolution or liquidation,
then in each case proper provision shall be made so that the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns, if
applicable), or transferee of such assets, or such liquidating trust or other
agent, as the case may be, shall expressly assume all of Sellers obligations
under this Agreement, including Sellers obligations pursuant to _Article
VII_ and _Section 8.03_ hereof, which shall continue in effect after
the consummation of such transaction. Prior to any such transaction, Seller
shall notify Buyer of any transaction that would trigger the terms of this
_Section 5.05_ and the terms thereof, including the identity of the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity, transferee, liquidating trust
or other agent, as the case may be.

  



  

5.06 _Third Party Consents_. Seller shall, subsequent to the Closing, use
reasonable best efforts to obtain those consents required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby under the contracts set
forth on, or required to be set forth on, _Schedule 3.04_  (the " _Consents_
") and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide assistance for
any notices required to be given under the contracts set forth on, or
required to be set forth on, _Schedule 3.04_ , as applicable. If a Consent
cannot be obtained, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide
the Company with substantially similar rights and benefits of the affected
contract for the term thereof, and to enable Buyer to conduct the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries until such Consent is obtained and shall
indemnify Buyer for any losses suffered by the Company or its Subsidiaries
for any Losses resulting from the loss of the benefits of such contract.  If
Seller provides the rights and benefits under any such contract, the Company
shall assume the obligations and burdens under such contract.

  



        
   

  



  

ARTICLE VI.

  



  

 _COVENANTS OF BUYER_

  



  

6.01 _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Company to (a) provide Seller and its
authorized representatives with reasonable access (for the purpose of
examining and copying), upon advance notice and during normal business hours,
to the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
periods on or prior to the Closing Date and/or in connection with any matter
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and (b) make available and deliver to Seller, **** in a timely
manner, the records, files, data and information, including the information
consisting of the Companys consolidation file and other disclosure
schedules, necessary for Seller to prepare and complete its quarterly and
annual consolidated financial statements and other public reports required to
be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, for each of the
periods (i) beginning on July 1, 2010 through September 30, 2010 and (ii)
beginning on October 1, 2010 through the Closing Date, in each case
consistent with past practice.  Unless otherwise consented to in writing by
Seller, Buyer shall not permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, for a
period of six (6) years following the Closing Date, to destroy, alter or
otherwise dispose of any of its books and records, or any portions thereof,
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries for periods on or prior to the
Closing Date without first giving at least thirty (30) days prior written
notice to Seller and offering to surrender to Seller such books and records
or such portions thereof.

  



  

6.02 _Directors and Officer Liability_. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall
have no obligation post-Closing to indemnify or advance any expenses to any
director or officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries if such individual is
or was a director, officer or employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries) as of or prior to the Closing Date,
and Seller shall indemnify the Company in connection with any such payment or
related claim.

  



  

6.03 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) _Continuing Employees_. Seller shall take all necessary action to ensure
that upon the Closing, (i) all Employees will cease to participate in, and
(ii) the Company and/or its Subsidiaries shall cease to be "participating
employers" (or comparable participating entities) under, each of the Seller
Benefit Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall continue to provide
benefits under Seller Benefit Plans to the Continuing Employees (as defined
below) and any Employees hired following the date of the Closing under the
Seller Benefit Plans set forth on _Schedule 6.03(a)_ for the period
beginning upon the Closing and through December 31, 2010, to the extent to
which the Continuing Employees participate in each such Seller Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Closing. Buyer will reimburse Seller for
Sellers actual costs (determined based on premium or self-insured equivalent
rates) in providing such benefits promptly, but in no event later than thirty
(30) days after receipt of Sellers invoice for such costs. In addition, to
the extent that Seller or any Seller Benefit Plan incurs any cost, expense or
other Loss resulting from any Seller Benefit Plan being characterized by an
appropriate

  



        
   

  



  

Governmental Authority as a "multi-employer welfare arrangement" (within the
meaning of ERISA), Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless against
such cost, expense or other Loss and shall promptly reimburse any such
amounts to Seller upon receipt of notice thereof from Seller. From and after
the date through which such benefits continue, Seller shall retain all
obligations and liabilities under the Seller Benefit Plans, and neither Buyer
nor any of its Affiliates will have any obligation or liability with respect
thereto. Neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall assume sponsorship
or any liability with respect to any of the Seller Benefit Plans or any part
thereof, and no Seller Benefit Plan and no assets of any Seller Benefit Plan
will be transferred to Buyer or any of its Affiliates or to any plan of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates. Upon the Closing, each individual who is
an employee of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries (an " _Employee_ ")
immediately prior to the Closing shall continue as an employee of the Company
or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates immediately after the Closing (each,
a " _Continuing Employee_ "). For purposes of this _Section 6.03(a)_, the
term "Employee" shall include any individual who, on the Closing Date, is on
an authorized medical or short-term (but not long-term) disability leave
of absence or any other approved leave of absence from the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries who return to full time status within six (6) months
after the Closing. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.03(a)_ shall limit
the right of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to terminate the employment of
any Continuing Employee after the Closing.

  



  

(b) _Credit_. With respect to each "employee benefit plan" (as such term is
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that is maintained, sponsored or
contributed to by Buyer or its Subsidiaries (the " _Buyer Plans_ ") in which
any Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate, Buyer shall:  (A)
ensure that each Continuing Employee shall receive full credit for purposes
of eligibility for such employees service with the Company and/or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, to the extent such credit was recognized
under comparable Employee Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing
(including, without limitation, for purposes of determining benefit levels
applicable under any severance or termination pay arrangement), and (B)
make commercially reasonable efforts to cause there to be waived any
eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition limitations and give
effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations,
to amounts paid by Continuing Employees under comparable Employee Benefit
Plans, in each case, to the extent waived and given effect (as applicable)
under comparable Employee Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing.

  



  

(c) _Employment Practices_. From and after the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be solely responsible for, and Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Seller and its Affiliates harmless from and
against, any Losses arising from or relating to any acts or omissions of
Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) in
connection with the employment or termination of employment of the Continuing
Employees.

  



  

(d) _Performance_. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms all agreements
between either such party and any Continuing Employee as set forth on
_Schedule 6.03(d)_ and to continue to satisfy all other legal obligations of
the Company to any Company Employees.

  



  

(e) _Allocation_. For purposes of allocating responsibility under this
_Section 6.03_, a medical claim is deemed incurred when the services that
are the subject of the claim are performed; in the case of hospitalization,
upon commencement of hospitalization; in the case of

  



        
   

  



  

life insurance, when the death occurs; in the case of long-term disability
benefits, the later of when the disability is determined to have occurred by
the Companys insurance carrier or when the employee ceased active employment
as a result of the disability; and, in the case of workers compensation,
when the event giving rise to the claim occurs.

  



  

(f) _COBRA_. Buyer shall (i) assume any and all obligations to provide
continuation coverage pursuant to Section 601 of ERISA, et. seq. (" _COBRA_
"), with respect to Continuing Employees and their qualified beneficiaries
(excluding any individual who became a qualified beneficiary prior to
Closing), and (ii) indemnify Seller and its Affiliates for any and all Losses
incurred as a result of Buyers failure to provide continuation coverage to
any Continuing Employee or qualified beneficiary (excluding any individual
who became a qualified beneficiary prior to Closing), including, but not
limited to, any Losses or excise taxes arising pursuant to Code Section
4980B.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, during any transition period during
which Continuing Employees receive benefits under Seller benefit plans in
accordance with Section _6.03(a)_ above, Seller shall provide
continuation coverage under its plans as required by COBRA, the costs of
which shall be reimbursed by Buyer in accordance with _Section 6.03(a)_
above.

  



  

(g) _No Other Rights_. Nothing in this _Section 6.03_ shall be deemed to
create or confer any rights or remedies (including any agreement for
employment or other benefits) in any Person other than the parties hereto.

  



  

6.04 _Insurance; Risk of Loss_.

  



  

(a) As of the close of business on the Closing Date: (i) Seller will terminate
or cause its Affiliates to terminate all insurance coverage with respect to
events occurring on or after the Closing Date relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective businesses, assets and employees under the
policies of insurance of Seller maintained for the benefit of all of its
controlled subsidiaries, including the Company and its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) no such termination of any "occurrence
based" policy in force as of the Closing Date shall be effected so as to
prevent the Company and its Subsidiaries from recovering under such policies
for losses covered thereby from events occurring on or prior to the Closing
Date, it being understood that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
responsible for any deductible payable under the terms of the applicable
policy in connection with any such claims; (B) no such termination of any
"claims made" policy in force as of the Closing Date shall be effected so as
to prevent the Company and its Subsidiaries from recovering under such
policies for losses covered thereby arising from or out of any claim made on
or prior to the Closing Date, it being understood that the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be responsible for any deductible payable under the terms
of the applicable policy in connection with any such claims; and (ii) Buyer
shall become solely responsible for all insurance coverage and related risk
of loss with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
businesses, assets and employees in connection with events occurring on or
after the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Buyer and its Affiliates to make claims for indemnification under the terms
of the policies set forth in clause (a) above.

  



         
 

  



  

6.05 _Non_ _-_ _Solicitation_. For a period of two (2) years after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries not to, whether for their own account or for the account of any
Person, solicit, offer employment to or hire any individual that is employed
by Seller or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)
on the Closing Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not be prohibited from (i) initiating searches for
employees through the use of general advertisement or through the engagement
of firms to conduct searches that are not targeted or focused on Seller and
its Subsidiaries (and the hiring of employees that respond to any such
searches), (ii) hiring any such employee not employed by Seller or its
Subsidiaries at the time of solicitation or (iii) hiring any employee who
contacts the Company or its Subsidiaries on his or her own initiative.

  



  

6.06 _Restricted Stock Unit Awards_. Following the Closing, SPI shall, and
Buyer shall cause SPI to (i) send, upon or within 15 Business Days after the
Closing Date, an RSU acknowledgement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
A_ (the " _RSU Acknowledgement_ ") to each holder of a Restricted Stock Unit
Award listed on  _Schedule 6.06_ (each, an " _RSU Holder_ ") and (ii) pay
from the Aggregate RSU Amount, on the 45th day following the Closing Date (or
if such date is not a Business Day, the first Business Day thereafter) (in
any case, the " _RSU Settlement Date_ "), to each RSU Holder who has
delivered an executed RSU Acknowledgement back to SPI on or prior to the
fifth day prior to the RSU Settlement Date, the amounts listed next to the
name of such RSU Holder on _Schedule 6.06_ (subject to applicable tax
withholding requirements). Seller shall have taken all action necessary or
desirable to ensure that all Restricted Stock Unit Awards shall terminate
upon the Closing and, except as expressly provided in this _Section 6.06_,
RSU Holders shall have no rights or interest in Restricted Stock Unit Awards
thereafter, other than the right to receive the amount listed next to such
RSU Holders name on _Schedule 6.06_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payments
to RSU Holders pursuant to this _Section 6.06_ shall be subject to
and conditioned upon the RSU Holders execution and delivery of an
RSU Acknowledgement in accordance herewith; in no event shall SPI pay any
portion of the Aggregate RSU Amount to any RSU Holder who has not delivered
to SPI an executed RSU Acknowledgement. All payments made by SPI at any time
relating to or in connection with a claim by any Person to rights under any
Restricted Stock Unit Awards shall be offset by the remaining Aggregate RSU
Amount until the remaining Aggregate RSU Amount is zero, and thereafter such
amounts shall be indemnifiable Losses pursuant to Article VII and Seller
shall be responsible for and shall pay any such amounts.

  



  

6.07 _Lease Guaranty_. Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall indemnify Seller for any and all Losses arising out of, relating to, or
in connection with Sellers obligations under that certain Guaranty of Lease
given by Seller to Nordhoff Industrial Complex, dated August 19, 2004.

  



  

ARTICLE VII.

  



  

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

  



  

7.01 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_. The
representations, warranties, and agreements set forth in this Agreement and
in any certificates delivered at the Closing in connection with this
Agreement shall survive the Closing until the 15-

  



        
   

  



  

month anniversary of the Closing Date notwithstanding any investigation at
any time made by or on behalf of Buyer and shall thereafter be of no further
force or effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) any covenant or agreement
required to be performed or complied with following the Closing Date will
survive the Closing in accordance with its terms, (b) the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 3.11_ shall survive the Closing and
continue in full force and effect until the 36-month anniversary of the
Closing Date notwithstanding any investigation at any time made by or on
behalf of Buyer and shall thereafter be of no further force or effect, (c)
the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 3.09_,  _3.13_ and
_3.16_ shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect until
the date that is ninety (90) days after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations and shall thereafter be of no further force or effect,
and (d) the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 2.01_,
_2.02_ , _2.03_ , _3.01(a)_ , _3.02_ ,  _3.03_ , _3.05(b)_ , _3.06(e)_ ,
_3.19_ , _3.27(a)_ , _4.01_ ,  _4.02_ and _4.05_ will survive the Closing
indefinitely (the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.09_
and the sections listed in this _Section 7.01(d)_, the "
_Specified Representations_ ").

  



  

7.02 _Indemnification by Seller for the Benefit of Buyer_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Article VII_, from and after the
Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer, its Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) and its and their respective officers,
directors, partners, members, employees, agents, representatives, successors
and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ")
harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities, obligations,
damages, Proceedings, demands, claims, assessments, judgments, penalties,
costs and expenses, including attorneys and other professionals fees and
disbursements and the costs of investigation and litigation (collectively, "
_Expenses_ ") (collectively, with any Expenses, " _Losses_ "), which the
Buyer Indemnified Parties may incur, accrue or suffer based upon,
attributable to or resulting from: (i) any breach by Seller of any
representation or warranty set forth in _Article II_ or _Article III_ of
this Agreement or any certificate delivered by or on behalf of
Seller hereunder at the Closing, (ii) any breach of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement to be performed or complied with by the
Company at the Closing, (iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement to be performed or complied with by Seller, (iv)
any inaccuracy in the Minimum Cash Certificate, if and to the extent that
the actual amount of Cash on Hand as of the Closing was less than the Minimum
Cash Amount, or that the actual amount of Cash on Hand located in bank or
brokerage accounts in the United States as of the Closing was less than the
US Minimum Cash Amount (it being agreed that the amount of any such
inaccuracy is an indemnifiable Loss hereunder), (v) any Losses in respect of
or related to any Seller Benefit Plan under Title IV of ERISA, or Section 412
or Section 4975 of the Code and (vi) the matters set forth on
_Schedule 7.02_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that any claim for
indemnification relating to, arising out of, or in connection with the
Restricted Stock Unit Awards shall be brought as a Third Party Claim pursuant
to _Section 7.05_, and Losses with respect to such claim shall first be
offset by the remaining Aggregate RSU Amount until the remaining Aggregate
RSU Amount is zero and thereafter may be sought directly against Seller.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
(i) Seller shall not have any liability under clause (i) of _Section
7.02(a)_ above, unless the aggregate amount of all Losses relating thereto
for which Seller would be liable, but for this section (including the proviso
to this clause (i)), exceeds on a cumulative basis $1,000,000 (the

  



        
   

  



  

" _Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent such Losses exceed the
Deductible; _provided_ , that Seller shall not have any liability under
clause (i) of _Section 7.02(a)_ above for any claim or group of related
claims if the Losses relating to such claim or group of related claims are
less than $10,000 in the aggregate (the " _Mini-Basket_ "), and (ii) the
aggregate liability of Seller under clause (i) of _Section 7.02(a)_ shall in
no event exceed $20,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "). The Deductible, the Mini-Basket
and the Cap shall not apply to breaches of any of the Specified
Representations or to any claim for indemnification under clauses (ii)
through (vi) of _Section 7.02(a)_, nor shall any breaches of any of the
Specified Representations or any claim for indemnification under clauses (ii)
through (vi) of _Section 7.02(a)_ be taken into account in the calculation
of whether the Deductible or the Cap have been met. The Mini-Basket shall
cease to apply when $300,000 worth of Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified
Parties would have otherwise been able to seek indemnification from Seller
pursuant to clause (i) of _Section 7.02(a)_ above were excluded
by application of the Mini-Basket.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary
(other than _Section 8.03_), Seller shall not be liable to, or indemnify,
the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any Losses that are punitive, special,
consequential, incidental, exemplary or otherwise not actual damages (except
to the extent constituting and paid in respect of Third Party Claims). The
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not use "multiple of profits" or "multiple of
cash flow" or any similar valuation methodology in calculating the amount of
any Losses not constituting Third Party Claims; _provided_ , _however_
, that the foregoing shall not limit Losses resulting from any final, non-
appealable injunction, court order, judgment or binding settlement materially
restricting the freedom of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to operate
its business as the same is conducted as of the date hereof.  This _Section
7.02_ constitutes the Buyer Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive remedy
for any and all Losses or other claims relating to or arising from this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (other than with respect
to Taxes as to which _Section 8.03_ governs). For the avoidance of doubt,
following the Closing, Seller shall not be liable for any Losses or
liabilities of Buyer, Company and its Subsidiaries, other than those set
forth in this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, solely for
purposes of Sellers indemnification obligations under this _Article VII_,
all of the representations and warranties of Seller and the Company set forth
in this Agreement or any certificate or schedule that are qualified as to
"material," "materiality," "material respects," "Material Adverse Effect" or
words of similar import or effect shall be deemed to have been made without
any such qualification for purposes of determining (i) whether a breach of
any such representation or warranty has occurred and (ii) the amount of
Losses resulting from, arising out of or relating to any such breach of
representation or warranty; _provided_ , that the foregoing clause (i) shall
not apply to the representation and warranty in the first sentence of
_Section 3.07_, the representations and warranties in _Sections 3.07(f)_ ,
_(m)_ , _(o)_ , the first and fifth sentences in _Section 3.08(c)_,
_3.10(a)_ , the first sentence of _Section 3.14_, the first clause of
_Section 3.20_, and the first sentence in _Section 3.29_ or be deemed to
modify or eliminate any dollar amount set forth in any representation and
warranty.

  



  

(e) No indemnifying party or any of its Affiliates shall have any right of
contribution from any indemnified party or any of its Affiliates with respect
to any Losses claimed by an indemnified party.

  



        
   

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties hereto agree
and acknowledge that any Buyer Indemnified Party may bring a claim for
indemnification for any Loss under this _Article VII_ notwithstanding the
fact that such Buyer Indemnified Party had knowledge of the breach, event or
circumstance giving rise to such Loss prior to the Closing.

  



  

(g) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover for the
amount of any Loss arising under one provision of this Agreement to the
extent that the Buyer Indemnified Parties had already recovered for such
amount of such Loss pursuant to another provision of this Agreement.

  



  

7.03 _Indemnification by Buyer for the Benefit of Seller_. Subject to the
provisions of this _Article VII_, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall
indemnify and hold Seller, its Affiliates and its and their respective
officers, directors, partners, members, employees, agents, representatives,
successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified
Parties_ ") harmless from and against any and all Losses which the Seller
Indemnified Parties may incur, accrue or suffer based upon, attributable to
or resulting from: (a) any breach by Buyer of any representation or warranty
set forth in _Article IV_ of this Agreement or any certificate delivered by
or on behalf of Buyer hereunder at or in connection with the Closing, or (b)
any non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement to be performed or complied with by Buyer and/or, from and after
the Closing, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

7.04 _Manner of Payment_. **** Any indemnification payment pursuant to this
_Article VII_ shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available
funds from the applicable indemnifying party to an account designated in
writing by each applicable indemnified party within five (5) days after the
determination thereof.

  



  

7.05 _Notice and Defense of Third Party Claims_.

  



  

(a) Any Person making a claim for indemnification under _Section 7.02_ or
_Section 7.03_ (an " _Indemnitee_ ") shall notify the indemnifying party (an
" _Indemnitor_ ") of the claim in writing promptly after receiving notice of
any Proceeding, demand or other claim against the Indemnitee (if by a third
party, a " _Third Party Claim_ "), describing the claim, the amount thereof
(if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof in reasonable detail (such
written notice, an " _Indemnification Notice_ "); _provided_ that the failure
to so notify an Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its
obligations hereunder except to the extent that (and only to the extent that)
such failure shall have caused the Losses for which the Indemnitor is
obligated to be greater than such Losses would have been had the Indemnitee
given the Indemnitor prompt notice hereunder. Any Indemnitor shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of a Third Party Claim giving rise to
an Indemnitees claim for indemnification at such Indemnitors expense, and
at its option (but subject to _Section 7.05(b)_ in the case of Excluded
Claims) shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof within thirty (30)
days after its receipt of notice of a Third Party Claim from the Indemnitee
(or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires) by notifying
the Indemnitee in writing within such thirty (30) day period of such election
and by appointing a reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee
to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense; _provided_ that the
Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third
Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose;

  



        
   

  



  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the fees and Expenses of such separate counsel
shall be borne by the Indemnitee and shall not be recoverable from such
Indemnitor under this _Article VII _unless (i) the Indemnitee is requested
by the Indemnitor to so participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the Indemnitee, a conflict or potential conflict exists between
the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor that would make such separate
representation advisable. If the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall only be entitled to settle such
Third Party Claim if (i) the Indemnitor obtains the prior written consent of
the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) before
entering into any settlement of a Third Party Claim and (ii) such settlement
expressly and unconditionally releases the Indemnitee from all liabilities
and obligations with respect to such claim. If the Indemnitor assumes
such defense, (i) the Indemnitor shall acknowledge the
Indemnitors indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to such Third
Party Claim, and shall not thereafter contest the Indemnitors obligation to
indemnify the Indemnitee for all Losses resulting therefrom, (ii) the
Indemnitor shall not thereafter cease to defend such Third Party Claim and
(iii) the Indemnitor shall not be liable for any amount required to be paid
by the Indemnitee that exceeds, where the Indemnitee has unreasonably
withheld or delayed consent in connection with the proposed compromise or
settlement of such Third Party Claim, the amount for which that Third Party
Claim could have been settled pursuant to that proposed compromise or
settlement. In all cases, the Indemnitee shall provide its reasonable
cooperation with the Indemnitor in defense of Third Party Claims, including
by making employees, information and documentation reasonably available. If
the Indemnitor shall not assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim,
the Indemnitee may defend against such matter as it deems appropriate and the
Indemnitor shall reimburse the Indemnitee for all reasonable and documented
Expenses of defending such Third Party Claim upon submission of periodic
bills; _provided_ the Indemnitee shall not settle any such matter without the
written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld); _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing
proviso, if such Third Party Claim would reasonably be expected to result in
the Buyer Indemnified Parties incurring, accruing or suffering Losses, which
taken together with all other Losses of the Buyer Indemnified Parties for
which Seller has indemnified the Buyer Indemnified Parties, that exceed the
Cap, the Indemnitee may settle any such matter without the written consent of
the Indemnitor, and such settlement shall not be determinative of the
Indemnitors indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to such Third
Party Claim or the amount of Losses relating to such Third Party Claim. In
the event that the Indemnitor has consented to any such settlement, the
Indemnitor shall have no power or authority to object under any provision of
this _Article VII_ to the amount of any Losses reasonably claimed by the
Indemnitee with respect to such settlement. If there is a Third Party Claim
that, if adversely determined would give rise to a right of recovery for
Losses hereunder, then any amounts incurred or accrued by the Indemnitee in
defense of such Third Party Claim, regardless of the outcome of such claim,
shall be deemed Losses hereunder.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Third Party Claim involves a claim
(A) seeking injunctive relief with respect to the operation of the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (B) seeking to impose criminal (other
than misdemeanors) fines, penalties or sanctions or (C) by a current
material customer or supplier of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each such
Third Party Claim, an " _Excluded Claim_ "), then the Indemnitee shall, upon
written notice to the Indemnitor at the time notice of such Excluded Claim is
first given to the Indemnitor, have the right to elect to either (x) assume
the defense of such Excluded Claim, in

  



        
   

  



  

which case, such Excluded Claim shall be subject to this paragraph (b), or
(y) submit such Excluded Claim to the Indemnitor pursuant to paragraph (a)
above, in which case the procedures in paragraph (a) above shall apply and
such Third Party Claim shall thereafter no longer constitute an Excluded
Claim. If the Indemnitee elects to assume the defense of an Excluded Claim,
the Indemnitee shall, at its own expense, be permitted to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Excluded Claim and shall not be
obligated to seek the Indemnitors consent to any settlement; _provided_ ,
that if the Indemnitee shall settle any such Excluded Claim without the
written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not unreasonably be
withheld), such settlement shall not be determinative of the amount of Losses
relating to such Third Party Claim. In the event that the Indemnitor
has consented to any such settlement, the Indemnitor shall have no power
or authority to object under any provision of this _Article VII_ to
the amount of any Losses reasonably claimed by the Indemnitee with respect to
such settlement. The Indemnitor shall be permitted, at its own expense, to
participate in the defense of such Excluded Claim. Upon a final determination
of such Excluded Claim, the Indemnitee shall be permitted to proceed
directly against the Indemnitor for the amount of Losses incurred by reason
of such Excluded Claim pursuant to paragraph (a) above.

  



  

7.06 _Determination of Loss Amount_. The amount of any Loss subject to
indemnification under _Section 7.02_ or _Section 7.03_ or _Section 8.03_
shall be calculated net of (i) any Tax Benefit actually (and not potentially)
realized by the Indemnitee on account of such Loss, (ii) any reserves set
forth in the Latest Balance Sheet relating specifically to such Loss and
(iii) any insurance proceeds or other amounts under indemnification
agreements actually (and not potentially) received by the Indemnitee on
account of such Loss.  If the Indemnitee actually realizes a Tax Benefit on
account of such Loss after an indemnification payment is made to it, the
Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Person or Persons that made such
indemnification payment the amount of such Tax Benefit at such time or times
as and to the extent that such Tax Benefit is realized by the Indemnitee.
 For purposes hereof, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean any refund of Taxes to be
paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes which otherwise would be owed by the
Indemnitee, in each case computed at the highest marginal tax
rates applicable to the recipient of such benefit.  The Indemnitee shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under any insurance
policies and/or indemnification agreements potentially covering any Loss. For
the purposes of this _Section 7.06_ only, "commercially reasonable"
means the Indemnitees actions must be commercially reasonable taking into
account all relevant considerations, including the risk of increased
insurance premiums, the impact on insurance claims history, the risk of
insurance non-renewal, other insurance policy risks and consequences and all
other foreseeable consequences related to third parties, including
foreseeable impacts on customer, reseller, vendor, distributor, supplier,
strategic alliance, partner or other relationships. In the event that an
insurance or other recovery is made by any Indemnitee with respect to any
Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund
equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery (after deducting related costs
and Expenses and any resulting increased premium costs) shall be made
promptly to the Person or Persons that provided such indemnity payments
to such Indemnitee. The Indemnitors shall be subrogated to all rights of the
Indemnitees in respect of any Losses indemnified by the Indemnitors. For
Tax purposes, the parties agree that all payments made under this _Article
VII_ and _Section 8.03_ constitute adjustments to the Purchase Price
and shall report any payments as such on their Tax Returns, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

  



        
   

  



  

7.07 _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless a party hereto in respect of a breach of representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement shall terminate when the applicable representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement terminates pursuant to _Section 7.01_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless
shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which an Indemnitee shall
have, prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period, previously
made a claim by delivering an Indemnification Notice to the Indemnitor.

  



  

7.08 _Limitation on Recourse_. No claim shall be brought or maintained by
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries)
or their respective successors or permitted assigns against any officer,
director, employee (present or former) or Affiliate of any party hereto or
any direct or indirect equity holder of the Seller, in each case, which is
not otherwise expressly identified as a party hereto, and no recourse shall
be brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any
alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of any party hereto set
forth or contained in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto or any
certificate delivered hereunder.

  



  

7.09 _Mediation and Arbitration_. From and after the Closing Date, in the
event any claim, demand, disagreement, controversy or dispute (a " _Dispute_
") arises from or in connection with any claim for Losses under this _Article
VII_ and if the Dispute cannot be settled through direct discussions, the
parties agree to endeavor first to settle such Dispute in an amicable manner
by non-binding mediation to be held in Los Angeles, California, administered
by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Mediation Rules
before resorting to arbitration. Thereafter, any unresolved Dispute shall be
settled by binding arbitration to be held in Los Angeles, California,
administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its
Commercial Arbitration Rules.  At the conclusion of such arbitration, the
arbitrator(s) shall issue a reasoned award to the parties, and judgment on
the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof pursuant to _Section 10.15_.

  



  

ARTICLE VIII.

  



  

 _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS_

  



  

8.01 _Disclosure Generally_. If and to the extent any information required
to be furnished in any schedule is contained in this Agreement or in any
other schedule, such information shall be deemed to be included in all
schedules in which the information is required to be included to the extent
that the meaning of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face. The
inclusion of any information in any schedule shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment by the Company or Seller, in and of itself, that
such information is material to or outside the ordinary course of the
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

8.02 _Acknowledgment by Buyer_.

  



  

(a) Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction an
independent investigation and verification of the financial condition,
results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and projected
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, in

  



        
   

  



  

making its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Buyer has relied on the results of its own independent
investigation and verification and on the representations and warranties of
the Company and Seller expressly and specifically set forth in this
Agreement, including the schedules hereto. **SUCH REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES BY THE COMPANY AND SELLER CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND
EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND SELLER TO BUYER
IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND BUYER
UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ALL OTHER IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY
RELATING TO THE FUTURE OR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL CONDITION OR PROJECTIONS,
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY) ARE SPECIFICALLY
DISCLAIMED BY THE COMPANY AND SELLER. **The Company and Seller do not make
or provide, and Buyer hereby waives, any implied warranty or representation,
as to the quality, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
conformity to samples, or condition of the Companys or any of
its Subsidiaries assets or any part thereto.

  



  

(b) In connection with Buyers investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, Buyer has received from or on behalf of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or Seller certain projections. Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans, that Buyer is familiar with such
uncertainties, that Buyer has made its own independent evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts
and plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts), and that
Buyer shall have no claim against the Company, its Subsidiaries, Seller or
any direct or indirect equity holder of Seller with respect thereto.
Accordingly, neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor Seller makes
any representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to such estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts).

  



  

8.03 _Tax Matters_. The following provisions shall govern the allocation of
responsibility as between Buyer and Seller for certain tax matters following
the Closing Date.

  



  

(a) _Tax Indemnity_. Seller shall be liable for and pay, and shall indemnify
Buyer (and the Company and each Subsidiary) against, (A) all Taxes of any
Person (other than the Company or any Subsidiary) imposed on the Company or
any Subsidiary, or for which the Company or any Subsidiary may otherwise be
liable, as a result of having been a member of a Company Group (including,
but not limited to, the Parent Group) for any period prior to or including
the Closing Date (including, without limitation, Taxes for which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 or similar provisions of state, local or foreign Tax law as
a result of having been a member of a Company Group for any period prior to
or including the Closing Date), (B) (x) all income Taxes imposed on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before September 30, 2010 (as determined pursuant to
_Section 8.03(c)_) to the extent that such Taxes exceed the $488,911 amount
for income taxes payable that is set forth on the Latest Balance Sheet ,
provided, however, that such income Taxes shall not include (and hence Seller
shall not be liable for) any income Tax items that result in either (i) a
non-current deferred tax

  



        
   

  



  

asset to the extent that such asset is reasonably expected to result in a
deduction or income exclusion recognized (through an actual reduction of
Taxes) for a taxable year ending on or prior to December 31, 2012, or (ii) a
current deferred tax asset relating to a current asset or liability, and (y)
all non-income Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before September 30,
2010 (as determined pursuant to _Section 8.03(c)_) to the extent that such
Taxes exceed the $208,426 amount for such non-income Taxes liability that is
included within the accrued liabilities amount set forth on the Latest
Balance Sheet, (C) all Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning October
1, 2010, and ending at the end of the Closing Date to the extent that such
Taxes were incurred outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise
inconsistent with past custom and practice, it being understood for the
avoidance of doubt that such Taxes shall include Tax for any such period
resulting from (x) any Section 338(h)(10) Elections to be made with respect
to the purchase and sale (actual or deemed) of stock of any of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries  pursuant hereto, (y) any Taxes imposed on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of transactions contemplated
hereby (other than Taxes allocated to Buyer under _Section 8.03(g)_) and (z)
any Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of
the termination, satisfaction or cancellation of any intercompany accounts
pursuant to or as contemplated by _Section 3.31_ hereof, (D) all Taxes
imposed on the Seller as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any failure of Buyer to withhold any such Taxes (other than (1) any
withholding of Taxes by a jurisdiction arising solely as a result of a
present or former connection of the Buyer to such jurisdiction and (2) Taxes
allocated to Buyer under _Section 8.03(g)_) and (E) Losses arising as a
result of any breach of a representation or warranty under _Section 3.09_.
_Section 7.06_ shall apply to the previous sentence.

  



  

(b) _Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_.

  



  

(i) _Pre-Closing Tax Returns Required to Be Filed on or Prior to the Closing
Date_. Seller shall file, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns of, or which
include, the Company and its Subsidiaries and which are required to be filed

shall pay to the Company or its Subsidiaries the amount of such Tax required
to be shown due to the extent such Tax is allocable to the portion of the Tax
period ending on or before September 30, 2010 (provided however, Seller shall
only be required to pay such Taxes (x) with respect to income Taxes, to the
extent that such Taxes exceed the $488,911 amount for income taxes payable
that is set forth on the Latest Balance Sheet, provided, however, that such
income Taxes shall not include (and hence Seller shall not be liable for) any
income Tax items that result in either (i) a non-current deferred tax asset
to the extent that such asset is reasonably expected to result in a deduction
or income exclusion recognized (through an actual reduction of Taxes) for
a taxable year ending on or prior to December 31, 2012, or (ii) a current
deferred tax asset relating to a current asset or liability, and (y)
with respect to non-income Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes exceed the
$208,426 amount for such non-income Taxes liability that is included within
the accrued liabilities amount set forth on the Latest Balance Sheet). In

Subsidiaries shall cooperate fully in providing all information in their
possession and not otherwise available to Seller that is required to be

Tax Returns as the Seller may reasonably request within ten (10) Business
Days of such request.

  



  

(iii) _Tax Returns for Post-Closing Taxable Periods (other than Straddle
Periods)_. Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed,
all Tax Returns of or which include the Company or its Subsidiaries and which

(iv) _Tax Returns Required to be Filed after the Closing Date for Straddle
Periods_. Seller and Buyer shall, unless prohibited by applicable Tax law,
take or cause to be taken all commercially reasonable action necessary or
appropriate to close the taxable period of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as of the Closing Date.  None of Seller, Buyer, the Company or its
Subsidiaries shall take any position inconsistent with the preceding sentence
on any Tax Return.

all Tax Returns of or which include the Company or its Subsidiaries for all
taxable periods that begin on or before and end after the Closing Date ("
_Straddle Periods_ "), and in each such case shall pay any and all Taxes due
with respect to such Tax Returns. To the extent any Taxes shown due on such
Tax Returns are allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period that ends on
the Closing Date, such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with prior practice unless otherwise required by applicable Tax Laws, Seller

  



        
   

  



  

shall have the right to review and comment on such Tax Returns and Buyer
shall consider in good faith any comments reasonably requested by Seller. On
or prior to the due date for payment of Taxes with respect to any such Tax
Returns, or, in the event of a dispute, upon a final resolution thereof,
Seller shall pay to the Company or its Subsidiaries the amount of Taxes shown
as due on such Tax Return allocable to and otherwise payable by Seller under
the following paragraph for the portion of such Straddle Period ending on
September 30, 2010 (provided however, Seller shall only be required to pay
such Taxes (x) with respect to income Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes
exceed the $488,911 amount for income taxes payable that is set forth on the
Latest Balance Sheet, provided, however, that such income Taxes shall not
include (and hence Seller shall not be liable for) any income Tax items that
result in either (i) a non-current deferred tax asset to the extent that such
asset is reasonably expected to result in a deduction or income exclusion
recognized (through an actual reduction of Taxes) for a taxable year ending
on or prior to December 31, 2012, or (ii) a current deferred tax asset
relating to a current asset or liability, and (y) with respect to non-income
Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes exceed the $208,426 amount for such non-
income Taxes liability that is included within the accrued liabilities amount
set forth on the Latest Balance Sheet).

  



  

(c) For purposes of allocating Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries for a
portion of a Tax period that includes September 30, 2010, the portion of any
such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the taxable period ending on
September 30, 2010, shall be:

  



  

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income
or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) (other than
conveyances pursuant to this Agreement, as provided under _Section
8.03(g)_), deemed equal to the amount which would be payable (after giving
effect to amounts which may be deducted from or offset against such Taxes) if
the taxable period ended on September 30, 2010; and

  



  

(ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the
assets of the Company or any Subsidiary, or otherwise measured by the level
of any item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire taxable
period (after giving effect to amounts which may be deducted from or offset
against such Taxes) (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears
basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period),
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
period ending on September 30, 2010, and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire taxable period.

  



  

(d) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to
this Agreement and any Tax Contest. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Contest and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

  



         
 

  



  

(e) _Contest Provisions_.  If, subsequent to the Closing, Buyer or the
Company or its Subsidiaries receives notice of a Tax Contest with respect to
any Tax Return for a Tax period or portion thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date, then within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice,
Buyer shall notify Seller of such notice. Buyer shall have the right to
control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest; _provided_ ,
___however_ , that Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed of the
progress of such Tax Contest and shall not effect any such settlement or
compromise of such Tax Contest without obtaining Sellers prior written
consent thereto, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that Seller shall have the sole right to control the conduct and
resolution of any Tax Contest that relates any Tax Return of the Company
or its Subsidiaries for a Tax period or portion thereof ending on or before
the Closing Date that is filed on a combined, consolidated or unitary basis.

  



  

(f) _Amended Returns; Refund Claims_.

  



  

(i) Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiaries shall not amend (or cause to be
amended) any Tax Return of the Company or its Subsidiaries for any period or
portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

the Closing Date. In respect of any other Tax Return, the carry-back to a
Pre-Closing Taxable Period of any item of deduction or credit incurred by the
Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, after the Closing Date shall
be subject to the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld.

to Buyer a statement setting forth the allocation of the applicable purchase
consideration (as determined for U.S. federal, state or local Tax purposes)
among the assets of SPI and SPSC and their Subsidiaries that are deemed
purchased by reason of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections (as revised under
this _Section 8.03(h)(iii)_, the " _Allocation Statement_ "). If Buyer
disagrees with the Allocation Statement, Buyer shall notify Seller of such
disagreement within ten (10) days after Sellers delivery of the Allocation
Statement, and Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
such disagreement. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve any such
dispute, such dispute shall be resolved promptly by a nationally recognized
accounting firm acceptable to Buyer and Seller, the costs of which shall be
borne equally by Buyer and Seller. If the Purchase Price is
subsequently adjusted in any manner as provided in this Agreement, Seller and
Buyer shall promptly revise the Allocation Statement in a manner consistent
with the foregoing.

adjustment by any Taxing Authority challenging the Allocation Statement.

in connection with obtaining such relief.  The equitable remedies described
