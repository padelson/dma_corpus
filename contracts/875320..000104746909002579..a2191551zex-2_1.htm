case, to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser will purchase from each Vendor,

ViroChem Employees and the ESOP Holders under this Article 2 shall be

 ** **

  

(1) The aggregate purchase price (the " **Purchase Price** ") for the Shares,
ViroChem Shares and ESOP Shares shall be Four Hundred Million U.S. Dollars
(US$400,000,000), subject to adjustment, if any, pursuant to Sections 2.04
and 2.05 of this Agreement.

  



  

(2) The Purchase Price shall be allocated between the Vendors, ViroChem
Employees and ESOP Holders, pro rata based on their ownership of the
outstanding shares of the Corporation at the Time of Closing, as set forth in
Column 6 on **Schedule 2.02(2)** , with the amount set forth next to each

 ** **

  

(1) Three Hundred Million U.S. Dollars (US$300,000,000) of the Purchase Price
shall be paid to the Vendors, ViroChem Employees and ESOP Holders, pro rata
based on their ownership of the outstanding shares of the Corporation
immediately prior to the Time of Closing in consideration for the number of
whole Shares, ViroChem Shares and ESOP Shares, respectively, as set forth in
Columns 1, 2A and 5A of **Schedule 2.02(2) **by the delivery of such number
of Parent Shares (the " **Consideration Shares** ") determined by dividing

Price, the whole subject to adjustment, if any, upon the terms of Section
2.05; provided, however, that any fractional share to be issued shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole share, with the number of Parent Shares set
forth next to each Vendors, ViroChem Employees and ESOP Holders name on

and the ViroChem Employees with the portion of such amount attributed to

of Closing by delivering the share certificates representing same to the
Holdback Escrow Agent to be dealt with by the Holdback Escrow Agent in

and ViroChem Employee shall contribute that portion of the Consideration
Shares to be delivered to the Holdback Escrow Agent equal to such Persons
proportionate share of the total number of the Shares and ViroChem Shares
held by the Vendors and ViroChem Employees.

  



  

(b) in the event that the cash amount withheld pursuant to Section 2.03(2)(c)
below is less than the amount required to be withheld in respect of Non-

day immediately prior to the Closing Date, rounded up to the nearest whole
share, shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent in trust at the Time of Closing
by delivering the share certificates representing same to the Escrow Agent to

(2) The $100,000,000 balance of the Purchase Price shall be paid in cash at

connection with the subscription to the ESOP Shares sold by it hereunder, the
whole as set forth in Column 9 of **Schedule 2.02(2)** , as converted into

(5) Parent or the Purchaser shall not be required to deliver to any

or other evidence of ownership of such Vendors, ViroChem Employees or ESOP
Holders Shares, as applicable, duly endorsed in blank for transfer, and such
other documentation as may be reasonably satisfactory to Parent. The
Purchaser shall hold in trust the portion of the Purchase Price payable to or
for the benefit of the holder of any certificate not presented at the Time of
Closing, provided that no interest will be paid on the cash portion of the

Closing Balance Sheet ** ****** determined as of 11:59 p.m. (Montreal time)
on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date; _provided,
however_ that all transactions occurring on the Closing Date but prior to the

and wiring instructions therefor. The Corporation and the Parent shall seek
to agree, in good faith, upon the Estimated Final Net Amount; _provided,
however,_  in the event that the Corporation and the Parent fail or are
unable to so agree on the Estimated Final Net Amount, the Purchase Price
payable on the Closing Date shall be increased based upon the Estimated Final
Net Amount furnished by the Corporation (which shall be deemed to be the
Estimated Final Net Amount for purposes hereof) and any dispute concerning
the amounts thereof shall be resolved after the Closing Date in accordance
with Section 2.04(7).

  



  

(2) On the Closing Date, immediately before the payments described in Section
2.04(3), Shire may exchange its Class B shares in the capital of the
Corporation for Class A shares or Class C shares of the Corporation, on
a one-for-one basis, and each of the ViroChem Trust and the Therapeutic Trust

A shares or Class B shares of the Corporation on a one-for-one basis. The
Vendors hereby consent to the foregoing and waive their pre-emptive rights
relating thereto pursuant to Section 5 of the Shareholders Agreement.

  



  

(3) On the Closing Date, immediately after giving effect to the issuance of
the ESOP Shares and the transactions described in Section 2.04(2) but
before the Time of Closing, the Corporation shall (i) reduce its stated
capital pursuant to section 38(1)(b) of the _Canada Business Corporations
Act_ by an amount and/or (ii) pay a dividend in an amount, in either or both
cases in aggregate amounts which shall be equal to the Estimated Final Net
Amount, which shall be paid to the Vendors, ViroChem Employees and ESOP

Corporation immediately before the Time of Closing as set forth in Column 6
of **Schedule 2.02(2) **by delivering immediately available funds by wire
transfer to the McCarthy Tetrault Trust Account set out in **Schedule
2.03(2)**.

  



  

(4) At the Time of Closing, the Purchaser shall contribute to the stated
capital account of the Class A Shares of the Corporation an amount of
$5,000,000.

  



  

(5) Forthwith after the Closing Date, the Securityholders Representative and
the Corporation shall prepare an unaudited balance sheet showing the assets
and liabilities of the Corporation determined as of 11:59 p.m. (Montreal time)
on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "
**Closing Balance Sheet** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that all transactions
occurring on the Closing Date but prior to the Time of Closing, including but

on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, which Closing
Balance Sheet shall include a reasonably detailed calculation of Final Net
Amount as of 11:59 p.m. (Montreal time) on the Business Day immediately
preceding the Closing Date. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in
accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, applied on
a basis consistent with prior periods. The Securityholders Representative
shall forward to the Purchaser the Closing Balance Sheet within thirty (30)
calendar days after the Closing Date, together with appropriate supporting
documentation consistent in scope and content with that which would be
required for a reasonable auditor to perform an audit of same, taking into
account, _inter alia_ , appropriate thresholds.

  



        
   

  



  

(6) The Purchaser undertakes to provide the adequate access to the required
members of management of the Corporation and to instruct them accordingly in
order to prepare with the Securityholders Representative the Closing Balance
Sheet as contemplated in the foregoing paragraph.

  



  

(7) If the Purchaser wishes to dispute any matter in the Closing Balance
Sheet, it may do so by notice (" **Notice of Dispute** ") to the
Securityholders Representative given within ten (10) Business Days of the
delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet to the Purchaser. A Notice of Dispute
shall specify the basis for each objection and the dollar amount involved.
The parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to amicably
resolve any matters identified in a Notice of Dispute as promptly as
practicable. If any such dispute shall not have been resolved within ten (10)
Business Days following the date on which the Notice of Dispute is given,
then either party may refer such unresolved matters to KPMG LLP (the "
**Third Party Auditors** ") for resolution. The Third Party Auditors shall
decide on the item(s) in dispute as follows:

  



  

(a) The Third Party Auditors shall have regard to the specifications of this
Agreement, in particular the standards referred to in the second paragraph of
this Section 2.04. The Purchaser shall make available all documents
and information to the Third Party Auditors for their decision.

  



  

(b) The Third Party Auditors shall give the parties the opportunity
to discuss the item(s) in dispute and explain their position prior
to rendering their decision. Each of the parties shall have the right to
request the Third Party Auditors to hold an oral hearing.

  



  

(c) The Third Party Auditors shall give their decision together with their
reasoning in writing to each party as soon as reasonably practicable but no
later than thirty (30) calendar days after the matter has been referred
to them.

  



  

(8) If no Notice of Dispute is given within the delay prescribed above, then
the Closing Balance Sheet shall be final and binding on the parties as of and
from the date of the delivery to the Purchaser. If a Notice of Dispute is
given in accordance with this Section 2.04, then the Securityholders
Representative and the Corporation, as applicable, shall, forthwith after
having amicably resolved all matters identified in the Notice of Dispute or
forthwith following the decision of the Third Party Auditors, as applicable,
amend the Closing Balance Sheet to reflect their amicable resolution of all
matters identified in the Notice of Dispute or the decision of the Third
Party Auditors and deliver the Closing Balance Sheet to the Purchaser and
such Closing Balance Sheet shall be final and binding on the Parties as of
and from the date of such delivery.

  



  

(9) The fees and disbursements of the Third Party Auditors shall be shared
equally by the Purchaser and the Vendors, with the Vendors portion to be
deducted from their pro rata share of the cash portion of the Holdback Amount
as set forth on Column 18 of **Schedule 2.02(2)**.

  



  

(10) The Purchase Price shall be reduced (the " **Purchase Price Reduction**
") by the amount, if any, by which the Final Net Amount is lower than the
Estimated Final Net Amount.

  



        

  



  

The Purchase Price shall be increased (the " **Purchase Price Increase**
") by the amount, if any, by which the Final Net Amount is greater than
the Estimated Final Net Amount. Any applicable Purchase Price Reduction shall
be payable to the Purchaser by a reduction of the Holdback Escrow Amount
in accordance with the Holdback Escrow Agreement and any applicable Purchase
Price Increase shall be payable in cash by the Purchaser to the Vendors, the
ViroChem Employees and the ESOP Holders pro rata based on their ownership of
the outstanding Shares, ViroChem Shares and ESOP Shares, respectively, as set
forth in Column 6 of **Schedule 2.02(2) **within five (5) Business Days of
the date on which the Closing Balance Sheet becomes final and binding on the
parties by delivering immediately available funds by wire transfer to the
McCarthy Tetrault Trust Account set out in **Schedule 2.03(2)**.

  



  

 **2.05** ** _Share Consideration Adjustment_**

  

 ** **

  

(1) If the Closing Reference Price is less than the Reference Share Price and
greater than 90% of the Reference Share Price, then the number of
Consideration Shares issuable at closing shall be determined by dividing
$300,000,000 by the Closing Reference Price.

  



  

(2) If the Closing Reference Price is equal to 90% of the Reference Share
Price or less, then the number of Consideration Shares issuable at closing
shall be determined by dividing $300,000,000 by 90% of the Reference Share
Price.

  



  

(3) Subject to Section 2.05(4), if the Closing Reference Price is equal or
superior to the Reference Share Price, then no adjustment to the number of
Consideration Shares issuable at closing shall be made.

  



  

(4) If as a result of an increase in the trading price of the Parent Shares
on The NASDAQ Stock Market following the date hereof, the Corporation
anticipates that the "cost of the Corporation", as of the Closing Date,
determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles,
would exceed, with respect to Parent, the condition of significance in the
definition of significant subsidiary in Rule 1-02(w)(1) of Regulation S-X
under the Securities Act at the 50% percent level, if the Vendors unanimously
so request, in their sole discretion, in writing at least three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the number of Consideration Shares issuable
at the Time of Closing shall be reduced by the number of Consideration
Shares specified in such notice.

  



  

(5) During the period during which the Closing Reference Price is determined,
Purchaser shall not (and shall not announce any intention to) acquire any
Parent Shares in the open market or take any action that is prohibited under
Regulation M under the Exchange Act in connection with a distribution of
securities.

  



  

 **2.06** ** _Section 116 Withholding_**

  

 ** **

  

(1) On or before the Closing Date, Franklin M. Berger, Vitus, and all ESOP
Holders and all ViroChem Employees who are non-residents of Canada, subject
to Section 2.06(2), for purposes of the Tax Act (each a " **Non-Resident
Vendor** ") will each deliver to the Purchaser a certificate in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser in respect of the sale and
purchase of its respective Shares, ViroChem Shares or ESOP Shares, as
applicable, issued pursuant to subsection 116(2) of the Tax Act, specifying a
certificate limit in an amount that is

  



        
   

  



  

not less than the Canadian Purchase Price allocated to such Non-Resident
Vendor and setting out the correct name and address of the Non-Resident
Vendor and the Purchaser and description of the Shares, ViroChem Shares or
ESOP Shares, as applicable, disposed of by the Non-Resident Vendor.

  



  

(2) If, on or before the Closing Date,

  



  

(a) no certificate under section 116 of the Tax Act described at Section
2.06(1) or 2.06(2)(b) is delivered to the Purchaser by a Non-Resident Vendor,
the Purchaser shall withhold from the portion of the Purchase Price payable
to such Non-Resident Vendor in cash (pursuant to Section 2.03(2)(c)) and, to
the extent of any shortfall in such amount, in Consideration Shares (pursuant
to Section 2.03(1)(b)), an amount equal to 25% of the Canadian Purchase Price
allocated to such Non-Resident Vendor, or

  



  

(b) a certificate is issued by the CRA pursuant to subsection 116(2) of the
Tax Act in respect of the disposition by a Non-Resident Vendor of the Shares,
the ViroChem Shares or the ESOP Shares, as applicable, setting out
the correct name and address of the Non-Resident Vendor and the Purchaser
and description of the Shares, ViroChem Shares or ESOP Shares, as
applicable, disposed of by the Non-Resident Vendor, but specifying a
certificate limit in an amount that is less than the Canadian Purchase Price
allocated to its respective Shares, ViroChem Shares or ESOP Shares, as
applicable, and otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser, is
delivered to the Purchaser, then the Purchaser shall withhold from the
portion of the Purchase Price payable to such Non-Resident Vendor in cash
(pursuant to Section 2.03(2)(c)) and, to the extent of any shortfall in such
amount, in Consideration Shares (pursuant to Section 2.03(1)(b)), an amount
equal to 25% of the amount by which the Canadian Purchase Price allocated to
such Non-Resident Vendor exceeds the certificate limit specified on the
certificate delivered to the Purchaser

  



  

(any such amount referred to as the " **Federal Withheld Amount** " for the
Non-Resident Vendor).

  



  

(3) The Purchaser will pay any such Federal Withheld Amount to the Escrow
Agent on the Closing Date, to be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and the amount so paid will be credited to
the Purchaser as payment on account of a portion of the Purchase Price.

  



  

(4) Where the Purchaser assigns the right to purchase the Shares, ViroChem
Shares and ESOP Shares to an Affiliate of Purchaser, the Purchaser shall so
notify the Non-Resident Vendors at least ten (10) days before the Closing
Date and the Non-Resident Vendors shall notify the CRA that such Affiliate of
the Purchaser, and not the Purchaser, is the Purchaser of the Shares,
ViroChem Shares and ESOP Shares. In the event the Purchaser assigns the right
to purchase the Shares, ViroChem Shares and ESOP Shares to an Affiliate of
the Purchaser and the Purchaser duly notifies the Non-Resident Vendors of
such assignment at least ten (10) days before the Closing Date, the
provisions of this Section 2.06 shall apply as if the references to

  



        
   

  



  

the Purchaser were references to such Affiliate of the Purchaser. In the
event that the Purchaser fails to notify the Non-Resident Vendors of an
assignment of its rights to purchase the Shares, ViroChem Shares and ESOP
Shares in accordance with this paragraph, a certificate issued
under subsection 116(2) of the Tax Act shall be valid for purposes of this
Section 2.06 if it is issued under the name of the Purchaser. If such a
notification is received by the Purchaser after the above-mentioned delay,
the Non-Resident Vendors will nevertheless take the necessary steps to obtain
another certificate issued under subsection 116(2) or subsection 116(4)
of the Tax Act that correctly identifies such Affiliate as the "purchaser."

  



  

(5) The foregoing provisions will apply _mutatis mutandis_ to any amount paid
to a Non-Resident Vendor in respect of a Purchase Price Increase pursuant to
Section 2.04.

  



  

 **2.07** ** _Section 1097 Withholding_**

  

 ** **

  

(1) On or before the Closing Date, Vitus will deliver to the Purchaser a
certificate issued pursuant to section 1097 of the QTA in respect of the sale
and purchase of its respective Shares, specifying a certificate limit in an
amount that is not less than the Canadian Purchase Price allocated to Vitus
and setting out the correct name and address of Vitus and the Purchaser and
description of the Shares disposed of by Vitus.

  



  

(2) If, on or before the Closing Date,

  



  

(a) no certificate issued by the ministre du Revenu du Quebec pursuant to
section 1097 of the QTA described at Section 2.07(1) or 2.07(2)(b)
is delivered to the Purchaser by Vitus, then the Purchaser shall withhold
from the portion of the Purchase Price payable to Vitus in cash (pursuant to
Section 2.03(2) (c)) and, to the extent of any shortfall in such amount, in
Consideration Shares (pursuant to Section 2.03(1)(b)), an amount equal to 12%
of its portion of the Canadian Purchase Price allocated to Vitus; or

  



  

(b) a certificate is issued by the ministre du Revenu du Quebec pursuant to
section 1097 of the QTA in respect of the disposition by Vitus of its
respective Shares setting out the correct name and address of Vitus and the
Purchaser and description of the Shares disposed of by Vitus, but specifying
a certificate limit in an amount that is less than the Canadian Purchase
Price allocated to its Shares, is delivered to the Purchaser, then the
Purchaser shall withhold from the portion of the Purchase Price payable to
Vitus in cash (pursuant to Section 2.03(2)(c)) and, to the extent of any
shortfall in such amount, in Consideration Shares (pursuant to Section
2.03(1)(b)), an amount equal to 12% of the amount by which the Canadian
Purchase Price allocated to Vitus exceeds the certificate limit specified on
the certificate delivered to the Purchaser

  



  

(any such amount referred to as the " **Quebec Withholding Amount** " for
Vitus).

  



  

(3) The Purchaser will pay any such Quebec Withholding Amount to the Escrow
Agent on the Closing Date, to be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and the amount so paid will be credited to
the Purchaser as payment on account of a portion of the Purchase Price.

  



        
   

  



  

(4) Where the Purchaser assigns the right to purchase the Shares to an
Affiliate of Purchaser, Purchaser shall so notify Vitus at least ten (10)
days before the Closing Date and Vitus shall notify the ministre du Revenu du
Quebec that such Affiliate of the Purchaser, and not the Purchaser, is the
Purchaser of its Shares. In the event the Purchaser assigns the right to
purchase the Shares to an Affiliate of the Purchaser and the Purchaser duly
notifies Vitus of such assignment at least ten (10) days before the Closing
Date, the provisions of this Section 2.07 shall apply as if the references to
the Purchaser were references to such Affiliate of the Purchaser. In the
event that the Purchaser fails to notify Vitus of an assignment of its rights
to purchase the Shares in accordance with this paragraph, a certificate
issued under 1097 of the QTA shall be valid for purposes of this Section 2.07
if it is issued under the name of the Purchaser. If such a notification is
received by the Purchaser after the above-mentioned delay, Vitus will
nevertheless take the necessary steps to obtain another certificate issued
under 1097 or 1100 of the QTA that correctly identifies such Affiliate as the
"purchaser."

  



  

(5) The foregoing provisions will apply _mutatis mutandis_ to any amount paid
to Vitus in respect of a Purchase Price Increase pursuant to Section 2.04
hereof.

binding obligation of the Vendor, enforceable against the Vendor in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,

the Vendors is a non-resident of Canada for purposes of the Tax Act or a
partnership that is not a Canadian partnership for purposes of section 102 of

other item of which such party becomes aware which would have been required
to have been disclosed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement had such

consequence of the exercise of options held by ViroChem Employees and ESOP
Holders or the sale by the Vendors, the ViroChem Employees or the ESOP
Holders, as the case may be, to the Purchaser of the Shares, the ViroChem
Shares or the ESOP Shares.

  



        
   

  



  

(2) The Corporation shall withhold from each payment or distribution to or
for the benefit of the ViroChem Employees or ESOP Holders from the date
hereof through the Closing Date, including from payments of the Purchase
Price hereunder, all amounts required by law to be withheld on account of
Taxes with respect to each such payment or distribution made or deemed to be
made to any of its present or former employees, officers and directors, and
with respect to such payment or distribution made to all persons who are non-
residents of Canada for the purposes of the Tax Act, all amounts required by
law to be withheld, and shall remit such withheld amounts within the
prescribed periods to the appropriate Governmental Authority. The Corporation
shall also, after the date hereof, remit to the proper Government Authority
all Canada and Quebec Pension Plan contributions, employment, insurance

its employees within the time required under the applicable legislation.

  



  

(3) The Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and filed on a timely basis all
Tax Returns for the Corporation for any period which ends on or before the
Closing Date and for which Tax Returns have not been filed as of such date.
The Purchaser shall also cause to be prepared and filed on a timely basis all
Tax Returns for the Corporation for all Straddle Periods (all such Tax
Returns together with the Tax Returns referred to in the first sentence of
this paragraph being referred to herein as " **Stub Period Returns** "). The
Vendors and the Purchaser shall co-operate fully with each other and
make available to each other in a timely fashion such personnel, data and
other information as may reasonably be required for the preparation of all
Stub Period Returns including, without limitation, all personnel and data
related to Canadian and Quebec research and development investment tax credit
claims and shall preserve such data and other information until the
expiration of any applicable limitation period under any Applicable Law with
respect to such Stub Period Returns. At least thirty (30) **** days prior
to the date on which a Stub Period Return is due to be filed, the Purchaser
shall provide to the Auditor and the Vendors a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on a copy of such Stub Period Returns.

  



  

(4) If, except as required by Applicable Law or as agreed to by the two-
thirds in interest of the Vendors (based on the Shares listed in Column 1 of
**Schedule 2.02(2)** ), the Purchaser causes the Corporation to take any
action on or after the Closing Date, make any election or deemed election or
make or change any Tax election, amend any Tax Return or take any position on
any Tax Return that results in or increases the amount of Taxes payable by
the Corporation in respect of any period ending on or before the Closing
Date, the Purchaser agrees that the Vendors are to have no liability for any
Tax resulting from any such action. The Purchaser and the Parent will
solidarily (hereby waiving the benefit of divisibility) indemnify and save
harmless the Vendors, the ViroChem Employees, the ESOP Holders and the
directors of the Corporation (where such action pertains to a Tax for which
such directors may incur a personal liability), from and against all such
Taxes arising out of or resulting from such action.

  



  

(5) The Purchaser will provide notice to the Vendors of any inquiries made
by, discussions with or representations or submissions proposed to be made to
any Taxation Authority to the extent that the subject matter thereof relates
to representations, covenants or obligations of the Vendors hereunder and
could reasonably give rise to a right of indemnity hereunder. The Purchaser
will forthwith advise the Vendors of the substance of any such inquiries
or discussions and provide the Vendors with copies of any written
communications

  



        
   

  



  

from any Taxation Authority relating to such inquiries or discussions. The
Purchaser will provide the Vendors a reasonable opportunity to comment on any
such representations or submissions and to attend any meeting with any such
Taxation Authority with respect to such matters.

  



  

(6) Upon request of a Vendor, the Purchaser and the Corporation will effect
the election described in subsection 256(9) of the Tax Act.

  



  

 **4.06** ** _Confidentiality_**

  

 ** **

  

(1) Both prior to the Closing Date and, if the sale and purchase of the
Shares, the ESOP Shares and ViroChem Shares hereunder fails to occur for
whatever reason, thereafter, the Parent and the Purchaser will not disclose
to anyone or use for its own or for any purpose other than the purpose
contemplated by this Agreement any confidential information concerning the
Vendors or the Corporation obtained by the Parent and the Purchaser pursuant
hereto, will hold all such information in the strictest confidence and, if
the sale and purchase of the Shares, the ESOP Shares and the ViroChem Shares
hereunder fails to occur for whatever reason, will return all documents,
records and all other information or data relating to the Vendors or to the
Corporation which the Parent and the Purchaser obtained pursuant to this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Such
return of documents shall be certified in writing by a senior officer of the
Parent or the Purchaser. The Parent and the Purchaser agree and acknowledge
that remedies at law for any breach of its obligations under this Section
4.06 may be inadequate and that, in addition thereto, the Vendors and the
Corporation shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction
and, to the extent practicable, specific performance, in the event of any
such breach; and

  



  

(2) The Vendors, ViroChem Employees and ESOP Holders agree to, and shall
cause their agents, representatives, Affiliates, partners, employees,
officers and directors to: (i) treat and hold as confidential (and not
disclose or provide to any person access to) all confidential information
(whether oral or written) concerning the Parent and the Purchaser if marked or
disclosed as such or the Corporation, except as may be required to be
disclosed by Applicable Laws, (ii) in the event that any Vendor, ViroChem
Employee or ESOP Holder or any such agent, representative, Affiliate,
partner, employee, officer or director becomes legally compelled to disclose
any such confidential information to the extent practicable, provide the
Parent and the Purchaser with prompt written notice of such requirement so
that the Parent and the Purchaser or the Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates may seek a protective order or other remedy or waive
compliance with this Section 4.06, and (iii) in the event that such
protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or the Parent or the
Purchaser waives compliance with this Section 4.06, furnish only that portion
of such confidential information which it is legally required to provide and
exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that
confidential treatment will be accorded all such confidential information.
Each Vendor, ViroChem Employee and ESOP Holder agrees and acknowledges that
remedies at law for any breach of its obligations under this Section 4.06 may
be inadequate and that, in addition thereto, the Parent and the Purchaser
shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific
performance, in the event of any such breach.

  



        
   

  



  

 **4.07** ** _Release of Claims_**

  

 ** **

  

Each Vendor, on behalf of it and its successors and assigns, hereby releases
and forever discharges the Corporation, the Parent and the Purchaser and each
of their officers and directors, from any and all actions, accounts,
agreements, bonds, causes of action, claims, contracts, damages, debts,
demands, doings, dues, executions, extents, omissions, promises, reckonings,
specialties, suits, sum(s), variances and liabilities whatever, in law or
equity, which such Vendor, in its capacity as a shareholder of the

Corporation arising out of any act or omission prior to the Time of Closing,

(1) by the Purchaser and the Parent if a breach of any representation,

and/or the Corporation, in each case such that the conditions set forth in
Sections 5.02(1), 5.02(2), 5.02(3) or 5.02(4) would not be satisfied and such
breach has not been waived or is incapable of being cured or, if capable of
being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days following the
date on which the Purchaser and the Parent notify the Vendors and the
Corporation of such breach;

  



  

(2) by the Vendors if a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of
this Agreement has been committed by the Purchaser or the Parent, in each
case such that the conditions set forth in Sections 5.03(1) or 5.03(2)
would not be satisfied and such breach has not been waived or is incapable of

(3) by written agreement of the Purchaser, the Parent, the Corporation and

(5) by the Vendors, if there has been any Material Adverse Effect in respect

court or Governmental Authority shall have issued an order or taken any other
action, in each case, which has become final and non-appealable and which
restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement;  _provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 5.05(4) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to fulfill any obligation or condition under this Agreement has
been the cause of, or resulted in, such order or other action; or

  



  

(7) by the Vendors or the Purchaser and the Parent if the completion of the
transactions herein contemplated has not occurred (other than as a result of
a failure by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to satisfy a
closing condition in favour of the other party which is within its reasonable
control and subject to the party seeking to terminate this Agreement not
being otherwise in default or breach) on or before the date which is one
hundred and twenty (120) days from the date of this Agreement, or such later

 **5.06** ** _Effect of Termination_**

  

 ** **

  

(1) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 5.05, this
Agreement (except for Sections 4.06 ( _Confidentiality_ ) and 8.03 ( _Fees
and Commissions_ ), which shall survive such termination) will then be null
and void and have no further force and effect, and no party shall have any
Claim to performance of any nature whatsoever against any other party under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) termination rights
arise as contemplated by Section 5.05(1) or 5.05(2) and the party which is
seeking termination of this Agreement is not itself in default or (ii) in the
case of a termination right arising under Section 5.05(7), the failure of the
closing to occur results from a default by the other party to satisfy a
closing condition which is within its reasonable control, then the parties
agree in either case (x) that irreparable damage (for which monetary damages
would not be an adequate remedy) would occur, and (y) in addition to any
other remedies, upon the occurrence of any such event, the non-breaching
party shall have the right to obtain a decree of specific performance or
other injunctive relief (without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of
monetary damages as a remedy) to prevent the continuation of any such event.

  



  

(2) Nothing in this Article 5 shall relieve or have the effect of relieving a
party from liability for damages incurred or suffered by another party as a
result of a breach of this Agreement by such party acting in bad faith with a
clear intent and design to prevent the conditions precedent to this
Agreements completion from being satisfied.

Days after first having actual knowledge of the matter; provided that no
failure to provide such written notice shall excuse the indemnifying party
from any of its obligations under this Article 7 except to the extent that
the indemnifying party can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a result
of such failure. Prior to receipt of a Third Party Claim (as defined below),
neither the Parent, the Purchaser nor any Purchaser Indemnitee shall
undertake to compromise or offer to settle any potential claims of third
parties for which Claims might be indemnifable under this Article 7.

  



  

(2) In the event that any action shall be instituted or that any claim or
demand shall be asserted by any third party in respect of which
indemnification may be sought under Article 7 hereof (regardless of the
limitations set forth therein) (each, a " **Third Party Claim** "), the
indemnified party shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any
Third Party Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this
indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. The failure of the

shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying partys
obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that the indemnifying
party can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a result of such failure.
Subject to the provisions of this Section 7.06,

  



        
   

  



  

the indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole expense, to be
represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory
to the indemnified party, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Claims
indemnified against hereunder, including but not limited to asserting claims
and affirmative defenses and impleading or pursuing claims against other
Persons who may have been responsible for all or part of the Claims
associated with such Third Party Claim. If the indemnifying party elects to
defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third
Party Claim which relates to any Claims indemnified by it hereunder, it shall
within thirty (30) days of the indemnified partys written notice of the
assertion of such Third Party Claim (or sooner, if the nature of the Third
Party Claim so requires) notify the indemnified party of its intent to do so;
_provided_ , that the indemnifying party must conduct the defense of the
Third Party Claim actively and diligently thereafter in order to preserve its
rights in this regard. If the indemnifying party elects not to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which
relates to any Claims indemnified against hereunder, fails to notify the
indemnified party of its election as herein provided or contests its
obligation to indemnify the indemnified party for such Claims under this
Agreement, the indemnified party may defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim at its own expense. If the
indemnified party defends any Third Party Claim, then the indemnifying party
shall reimburse the indemnified party for the expenses of defending such
Third Party Claim upon submission of periodic bills. If the indemnifying
party shall assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, the indemnified
party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such
Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that such indemnified party shall
be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the
expense of the indemnifying party if (i) so requested by the indemnifying
party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
indemnified party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party that would make such separate
representation advisable; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the indemnifying
party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel for all
indemnified party in connection with any Third Party Claim. The parties
hereto agree to provide commercially reasonable access to the other to such
documents and information as may be reasonably requested in connection with
the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.06 to the contrary, neither
the indemnifying party nor the indemnified party shall, without the written
consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or
permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment unless the claimant or
claimants and such party provide to such other party an unqualified release
from all liability in respect of the Third Party Claim. If the indemnifying
party makes any payment on any Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party
shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and
remedies of the indemnified party to any insurance benefits or other claims
of the indemnified party with respect to such Third Party Claim.

  



  

(3) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the
time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been
consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have
arrived at a mutually binding agreement, in each case with respect to a Third
Party Claim hereunder, the indemnified party shall forward to the
indemnifying party notice of any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter and the indemnifying
party shall pay all of such remaining sums so due

funds within five (5) Business Days after the date of such notice; _provided_
, _however_ , that any amounts owed by a Vendor or ViroChem Employee shall be
paid out of the Holdback Escrow Fund in accordance with this Agreement and
the Holdback Escrow Agreement, if applicable.

  



  

(4) The Vendors, ViroChem Employees and ESOP Holders shall have no right of
contribution or other recourse against the Corporation or its directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, agents, attorneys, representatives, assigns
or successors for any Third Party Claims asserted by the Purchaser
Indemnitees, it being acknowledged and agreed that the covenants and
agreements of the Corporation are solely for the benefit of the Purchaser
Indemnitees.

(2) _Authority_. The appointment of the Securityholders Representative by
each such ViroChem Employee and ESOP Holder is coupled with an interest and
may not be revoked in whole or in part (including, without limitation, upon
the death or incapacity of such ViroChem Employees and ESOP Holders). Such
appointment shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators,
estates, personal representatives, officers, directors, security holders,
successors and assigns of each such ViroChem Employee and ESOP Holder. All
decisions of the Securityholders Representative shall be final and binding
on all of the ViroChem Employees and ESOP Holders, and no such ViroChem
Employees and ESOP Holders shall have the right to object, dissent, protest
or otherwise contest the same. The Parent and the Purchaser shall be entitled
to rely upon, without independent investigation, any act, notice, instruction
or communication from the Securityholders Representative and any document
executed by the Securityholders Representative on behalf of any such
ViroChem Employees and ESOP Holders and shall be fully protected
in connection with any action or inaction taken or omitted to be taken in
reliance thereon absent wilful misconduct. The Securityholders
Representative shall not be responsible for any loss suffered by, or
liability of any kind to, such ViroChem Employees and ESOP Holders arising
out of any act done or omitted by the Securityholders Representative in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Securityholders
Representatives duties hereunder, unless such act or omission involves gross
negligence or wilful misconduct.

  



  

(3) _Limitations on Authority_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Section 7.09(2) or any other provision of this Agreement or the Holdback
Escrow Agreement, the Securityholders Representative shall have no authority
with respect to Claims for

  



        
   

  



  

indemnification against an individual ViroChem Employee or ESOP Holder
pursuant to Sections 7.02(1)(a), 7.02(1)(b) or 7.03 of this Agreement or
with respect to any other Claims against an individual ViroChem Employee or
ESOP Holder, and the Purchaser and Parent shall deal exclusively with the
relevant ViroChem Employee or ESOP Holder, or such Persons authorized
representative, with respect to such matters.

  



  

(4) _Resignation_. The Securityholders Representative may resign by
providing thirty (30) days prior written notice to each ViroChem Employee,
ESOP Holder and the Parent. Upon the resignation of the Securityholders
Representative, a majority-in-interest of the Vendors shall appoint a
replacement Securityholders Representative to serve in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that such appointment shall be
subject to such newly-appointed Securityholders Representative notifying the
Parent in writing of his, her or its appointment and appropriate contact
information for purposes of this Agreement, and the Parent shall be entitled
to rely upon, without independent investigation, the identity of such newly-
appointed Securityholders Representative as set forth in such written
notice.
