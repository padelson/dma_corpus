 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreementˮ), dated as of August 29,
2018, is made by and among Stryker Corporation, a Michigan corporation
("Parentˮ), Austin Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Subˮ), and K2M Group
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Companyˮ). Defined terms used in
this Agreement have the respective meanings ascribed to them herein.

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent, the Company (the
"Company Boardˮ) and Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Boardˮ) have approved and, in
the case of the Company Board and the Merger Sub Board, declared advisable and
in the best interests of their respective stockholders, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the merger of Merger
Sub with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (the "Mergerˮ), upon the terms and
subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCLˮ);

WHEREAS, the Company Board has, subject to Sections 5.5(d) and 5.5(e),
resolved to recommend that the Company's stockholders approve the adoption of
this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties and covenants and subject to the conditions herein contained, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER

Section 1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation of the Merger and a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent (the "Surviving Corporationˮ).

Section 1.2. The Closing. Subject to the provisions of Article VI, the closing
of the Merger (the "Closingˮ) shall take place at 10:00 a.m. (local time) on a
date to be specified by the parties hereto, but no later than the second (2nd)
Business Day after the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of such conditions),
unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto (such date being the "Closing Dateˮ). The Closing shall take place at
the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 155 North Wacker
Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606. Section 1.3. Effective Time. Concurrently with the Closing, the Company shall
cause an appropriate certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the
"Certificate of Mergerˮ) to be executed and filed with the Delaware Secretary
of State as provided under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the
time the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary
of State or at such later date and time as is agreed between Parent and the
Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger
becomes effective being hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Timeˮ). The
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL.

Section 1.4. Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.

(a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, by virtue of the Merger, be
amended and restated in its entirety as set forth in Exhibit A hereto and, as
so amended and restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided by Law and such
certificate of incorporation (subject to Section 5.6).

(b) At the Effective Time, Parent shall take such action necessary to change
the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, to be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, except as to the name of
the Surviving Corporation, which shall be "K2M Group Holdings, Inc.", until
thereafter amended as provided by Law, the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

Section 1.5. Board of Directors; Officers. The members of the board of
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the members of the board of directors of the
Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers
of the Surviving Corporation, in each case to hold office in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected, designated or qualified.



ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1. Effect on Securities.

(a) Effect of Merger. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the
holders of any Securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

(i) Cancellation of Company Securities. Each share of common stock, $0.001 par
value per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stockˮ) held by the
Company as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent (including Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof (such
shares, "Canceled Sharesˮ).

(ii) Conversion of Company Securities. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Canceled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, $27.50 per share in
cash, without interest (such amount of cash, the "Merger Considerationˮ). Each
share of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1(a)(ii) shall no longer be
outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and
the holders of certificates (the "Certificatesˮ) or book-entry shares ("Book-
Entry Sharesˮ), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
Company Common Stock, shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2, the Merger
Consideration.

(iii) Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) fully paid
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation
and constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the number or type of outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification,
recapitalization, exchange, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination or readjustment of shares or any similar event or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the
Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent amounts and items, as
the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this
Section 2.1(b) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action
that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this
Agreement.

Section 2.2. Surrender of Certificates.

(a) Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Funds. Prior to the Closing,
Parent shall, at its sole cost and expense, enter into a customary paying
agent agreement with a nationally recognized financial institution designated
by Parent that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agentˮ)
for the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a)(ii).
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Paying Agent, for payment in accordance with this Article
II through the Paying Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Canceled
Shares or Dissenting Shares). Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent
if and as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation pending payment
thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the shares of Company Common
Stock, provided, however, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii) and to the extent of any such loss, Parent shall promptly
fund additional cash amounts to the Paying Agent sufficient to enable payment
of such amounts. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and
exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and no part of
such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of shares of Company
Common Stock.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any
event within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in
the form and have such other customary provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions (which instructions shall be in the form and
have such other customary provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for cash in an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates.

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in
exchange therefor as promptly as reasonably practicable, cash in an amount
equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate, and the
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) so surrendered shall be
forthwith cancelled. Each Book-Entry Share shall automatically upon the
Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent
to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Book-Entry Share. Until surrendered, in the case of a
Certificate, or paid, in the case of a Book-Entry Share, in each case, as
contemplated by this Section 2.2(c), each Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section
2.2(c). The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) and make such payments and deliveries with respect to Book-
Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with customary exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for
the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the cash
payable pursuant to this Section 2.2(c).

(d) Unregistered Transfers. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment of the appropriate amount of Merger Consideration may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer (and accompanied by all documents
reasonably required by the Paying Agent) or such Book-Entry Share shall be
properly transferred and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the satisfaction of Parent
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(e) Termination of Fund. Any portion of the funds made available to the Paying
Agent which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
the Surviving Corporation or its designee upon demand, and any such holders
prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as general creditor
thereof for payment of their claims for Merger Consideration.

(f) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration delivered
to a Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered or
Book-Entry Share not paid, in each case, in accordance with Section 2.2(c),
immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority under applicable Law, any such Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

(g) Withholding. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, any of their
applicable Subsidiaries and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration and any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, any of their applicable Subsidiaries or the Paying Agent are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so withheld
and paid over to an applicable Governmental Authority as required by
applicable Law shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, any of their
applicable Subsidiaries or the Paying Agent.

Section 2.3. Company Equity Awards.

(a) Treatment of Company Options. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall assume
any Company Option or substitute for any Company Option any similar award for
Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger and any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. At the Effective Time, each
Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto,
whether vested or unvested, shall by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of any holder of any Company Option be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive from the Company at the Effective Time a
cash payment (without interest) equal to (i) the product of (A) the excess, if
any, of (1) the Merger Consideration over (2) the per share exercise price of
such Company Option, and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option as of the Effective Time (the "Option
Considerationˮ), less (ii) any applicable withholding Taxes required by
applicable Law to be withheld. As of the Effective Time, all Company Options
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and
each holder of a Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Option Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise
price payable in respect of a share of Company Common Stock underlying a
Company Option equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, such Company Option
shall be cancelled for no consideration immediately prior to the Effective
Time and the holder thereof shall have no further rights with respect thereto.

(b) Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Awards. Neither Parent nor Merger
Sub shall assume any Company Restricted Stock Awards or substitute for any
Company Restricted Stock Awards any similar award of Parent Common Stock in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. As of the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Award that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any holder of any Company Restricted Stock Award be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive from the Company at the Effective Time a cash
payment (without interest) equal to (i) the product of (A) the Merger
Consideration and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Restricted Stock Award as of the Effective Time (the "Restricted
Stock Considerationˮ), less (ii) any applicable withholding Taxes required by
applicable Law to be withheld.

(c) Treatment of Company RSU Awards. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall
assume any Company RSU Award or substitute for any Company RSU Award any
similar award for Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the Effective Time,
each Company RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, shall by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any holder of any Company RSU Award be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive from the Company at the Effective Time a
cash payment (without interest) equal to (i) the product of (A) the Merger
Consideration and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company RSU Award as of the Effective Time (the "RSU Considerationˮ),
less (ii) any applicable withholding Taxes required by applicable Law to be
withheld; provided, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any Company RSU Award which
immediately prior to such cancellation is "deferred compensation" subject to
Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the applicable settlement date(s)
for such Company RSU Award if required in order to comply with Section 409A of
the Code.

(d) Method of Payment. Any Option Consideration, Restricted Stock
Consideration or RSU Consideration to which an employee or former employee of
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries becomes entitled pursuant to Section
2.3(a), Section 2.3(b) or Section 2.3(c) shall be paid through the payroll of
the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as soon
as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time (and in any event,
within ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Date). Any Option
Consideration, Restricted Stock Consideration or RSU Consideration to which
any other person becomes entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(a), Section 2.3(b)
or Section 2.3(c) shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable (or, at the option of the Surviving Corporation,
by the Paying Agent), as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time (and in any event, within ten (10) Business Days after the
Closing Date).

 (e) Company ESPP. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Company Board (or, if applicable, any committee thereof administering the
Company ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other necessary
actions such that (i) with respect to any Offering Period in effect as of the
date of this Agreement under the Company ESPP, such Offering Period shall
terminate and each ESPP Option shall be exercised upon the earlier to occur of
(A) an earlier Purchase Date ("New Purchase Dateˮ) in accordance with Section
6.04(a) of the Company ESPP that is no later than four (4) complete Trading
Days prior to the Effective Time or (B) the date on which the Offering Period
would otherwise end, and no additional Offering Period shall commence under
the Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement; (ii) no individual
participating in the Company ESPP shall be permitted to (A) increase the
amount of such participant's rate of payroll contributions thereunder from the
rate in effect as of the date of this Agreement or (B) except to the extent
required by applicable Law, make separate non-payroll contributions to the
Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement; (iii) no individual
who is not participating in the Offering Period in effect as of the date of
this Agreement may commence participation in such Offering Period following
the date of this Agreement; and (iv) subject to the consummation of the
Merger, the Company ESPP shall terminate as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The Company shall notify each participant in writing at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to any New Purchase Date that the Purchase Date
for such participant's ESPP Option (including for purposes of determining the
ESPP Option Price of such ESPP Option) has been changed to the New Purchase
Date and that such participant's ESPP Option will be exercised automatically
on the New Purchase Date, unless prior to such date the participant has
withdrawn from the Offering Period.

(f) Company Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide
such notice, if any, to the extent required under the terms of any of the
Company Equity Plans, obtain any necessary consents, adopt applicable
resolutions, amend the terms of any of the Company Equity Plans or any
outstanding awards thereunder, and take all other appropriate actions to (i)
give effect to the transactions contemplated herein; (ii) terminate each of
the Company Equity Plans as of the Effective Time; and (iii) ensure that after
the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Equity Award, any beneficiary
thereof nor any other participant in any of the Company Equity Plans shall
have any right thereunder to acquire any Securities of the Company or to
receive any payment or benefit with respect to any award previously granted
under any of the Company Equity Plans, except as provided in this Section 2.3.
The Company shall provide Parent with documentation evidencing the completion
of the foregoing actions (the form and substance of such documentation shall
be subject to review and approval by Parent, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) no later than the Business Day
preceding the Effective Time.

Section 2.4. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Paying Agent or Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable and customary amount as the Paying Agent or Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article II.

 Section 2.5. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, to the extent that holders of Company Common Stock are entitled
to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, any shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected his, her or its
demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and not effectively
withdrawn or lost such holder's rights to appraisal (the "Dissenting Sharesˮ),
shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall instead be
entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL (it being understood and acknowledged that at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and such holder shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the
consideration therefor as may be determined in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL); provided, however, that if any such holder shall have failed to
timely perfect or shall have waived, effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or
its right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL (whether occurring before,
at or after the Effective Time), or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
have determined that such holder is not entitled to such right to appraisal
and payment under Section 262 of the DGCL, such holder's shares of Company
Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, and such shares shall no longer be deemed to be Dissenting
Shares. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, effective or attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL received by the Company relating to appraisal demands, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all discussions, negotiations and Proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such
demand or Proceeding, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.6. Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights. At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and from and after
the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent for transfer following the Effective Time, they shall be canceled
against delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration, as provided for in
Section 2.1(a)(ii), for each share of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

Section 2.7. Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation or Parent with full right, title and possession of
and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company with respect to
the Merger, the officers and directors of Parent shall be fully authorized (in
the name of Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and otherwise)
to take such action.

the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements, exhibits and other
documents (including exhibits, financial statements and schedules thereto and
all other information incorporated therein and amendments and supplements
thereto) required by it to be filed (or furnished) under the Exchange Act or
the Securities Act (collectively, but excluding the Proxy Statement, the
"Company SEC Documentsˮ). As of its filing (or furnishing) date or, if amended
prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment

filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act, as of their
respective effective dates), each Company SEC Document complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act, as the case may be. As of its filing date or, if amended or
superseded by a filing or amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, as of
the date of the last such amendment, each Company SEC Document filed pursuant
to the Exchange Act did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Each Company SEC Document that is a
registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed
pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or
amendment became effective prior to the date of this Agreement, did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no amendments or modifications to the Company SEC Documents that are
required to be filed with (or furnished to) the SEC, but that have not yet
been filed with (or furnished to) the SEC. No Subsidiary of the Company is

in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; (iii)

in all material respects the financial position, the stockholders' equity, the
results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, as of the times and for the periods referred to therein (except

external purposes in conformity with GAAP. The Company has evaluated the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and,
to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Company
SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q or any amendment

significant aspects of such disclosure, if any) (i) all "significant
deficiencies" and "material weaknesses" (as such terms are defined in Auditing
Standard No. 5 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect
on the date of this Agreement) in the design or operation of internal control
over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves the
Company's management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting. Since January 1, 2015,

operation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

(e) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that all
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,

Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2015 through the date of this Agreement, there
have been no internal investigations regarding accounting, auditing or revenue
recognition discussed with, reviewed by or initiated at the direction of the
chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer or

Board, any board of directors of any of its Subsidiaries or any committee of
the Company Board or any board of directors of any of its Subsidiaries.

financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer
of the Company and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as

under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with
respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such

partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, on
the other hand), including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act), in each case,
where the result, purpose or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of
any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in the Company SEC Documents (including any audited
financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements of the Company
included therein).

"prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA and

the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or anticipated with or by the

provide any health or welfare benefits (whether or not insured) to retired or
other former employees, directors or consultants, except as specifically
required by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA ("COBRA") or, pursuant to an applicable
employment agreement or severance agreement, plan or policy listed in Section
3.12(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter requiring the Company or any
Subsidiary to pay or subsidize COBRA premiums for a terminated employee
following the employee's termination.

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, or any
termination of employment or service (or other event or occurrence) in
connection therewith will (i) entitle any current or former employee, director
or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any payment or
benefit (or result in the funding of any such payment or benefit) or result in
any forgiveness of Indebtedness with respect to any such persons; (ii)
increase the amount of any compensation, equity award or other benefits otherwise payable by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of
payment, funding or vesting of any compensation, equity award or other

with the transactions contemplated hereby will be an "excess parachute

nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to gross-up, indemnify or
otherwise reimburse any individual with respect to any Tax, including under
Sections 409A or 4999 of the Code.

(j) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has
used the services or workers provided by third Person contract labor
suppliers, temporary employees, "leased employees" (as that term is defined in
Section 414(n) of the Code), or individuals who have provided services as
independent contractors to an extent that would reasonably be expected to
result in the disqualification of any of the Benefit Plans or the imposition
of material penalties or excise taxes with respect to the Benefit Plans by the
Internal Revenue Service, the United States Department of Labor or the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and no such individuals are entitled to any
benefits under any Benefit Plan that they have been improperly denied by
reason of their misclassification as independent contractors.

(k) With respect to each Foreign Benefit Plan, except as would not be expected
to result in any material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries:
(i) such Foreign Benefit Plan is in compliance and has been administered at
all times in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Laws of such
jurisdiction in which such Benefit Plan is established and the terms of the
applicable Foreign Benefit Plan; (ii) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
have complied with all applicable reporting and notice requirements, and such
Foreign Benefit Plan has obtained from the Governmental Authority having

determinations, if any, that such Foreign Benefit Plan is in material
compliance with the Laws of the relevant jurisdiction if such determinations
are required in order to give effect to such Foreign Benefit Plan; (iii) to
the Knowledge of the Company, there are no pending investigations by any
Governmental Authority involving any Foreign Benefit Plan; and (iv) the
consummation of the contemplated transactions will not by itself create or
together with another event result in any liability with respect to such
Foreign Benefit Plan. Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates has (i)
ever been an employer in relation to, participated in, or had any liability
(whether prospective, contingent or otherwise) to or in respect of a Foreign
Benefit Plan constituting a defined benefit pension program or scheme, or (ii)
otherwise entered into any contractual arrangements, or given any promises or
commitments, relating to providing pension benefits to employees or officers
(or former employees or officers) pursuant to any plan, program, agreement or
arrangement that would constitute a Foreign Benefit Plan. If required under
applicable laws to be funded and/or book-reserved, such Foreign Benefit Plan
is funded and/or book-reserved, as appropriate, to the extent so required by
applicable Laws. Each Foreign Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify for
tax-preferential treatment under applicable Laws so qualifies, except as could
not reasonably be expected to result in a material liability.

 (l) No employee has transferred to the Company or any Affiliate in the United
Kingdom under the United Kingdom Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of

to any retirement benefits under a defined benefit pension scheme.

caused to be duly and timely filed (taking into account any extension of time
within which to file) all U.S. federal income and other material Tax Returns
required to be filed by any of them and all such filed Tax Returns (taking
into account all amendments thereto) are true, complete and accurate in all
material respects and (ii) paid all material Taxes due and owing (whether or
not shown on such Tax Returns) except to the extent that such Taxes are being
contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate
reserves have been maintained in accordance with GAAP.

(b) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries did not, as of the

in any notes thereto).

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no pending, ongoing or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, audits, examinations, investigations or
other Proceedings by any Governmental Authority in respect of material Taxes
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No deficiencies for a material
amount of Taxes have been claimed, proposed, assessed or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any
Governmental Authority that have not been fully paid, settled or withdrawn.
None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of
limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to any Tax assessment, deficiency or collection, which waiver or
extension currently remains in effect. Neither the Company nor its
Subsidiaries have received within the past three years a written claim from
any Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries does not currently file a Tax Return that it is or may be subject
to taxation by that jurisdiction in respect of Taxes that would be covered by

any of its Subsidiaries with respect to Taxes.

is or was required by Law to withhold or collect have been duly and timely
withheld or collected, and have been duly and timely paid to the proper
Governmental Authority or other proper Person or properly set aside in
accounts for this purpose.

(e) There are no Tax rulings, requests for Tax rulings, applications for
change in accounting methods or closing agreements with respect to Taxes, in
each case with a Governmental Authority, that could reasonably be expected to
materially affect liabilities for Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any period after the Effective Time.

(f) Except as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be required to include any
item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for
any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date as a
result of: (i) any installment sale or open transaction disposition made prior
to the Effective Time; (ii) any prepaid amount received on or prior to the
Effective Time; (iii) Section 481(a) of the Code (or an analogous provision of
state, local, or foreign Law) by reason of a change in accounting method prior

under Section 1502 of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law).

(g) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has ever been a member of a
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax group (other than such a group the
common parent of which is or was the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), and
none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability for
Taxes of any other Person (other than Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of foreign, state or local Law), as a transferee or successor or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, otherwise as a matter of Law.

(h) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound
by any Tax sharing, Tax allocation or Tax indemnification agreement or
arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between
or among the Company and its Subsidiaries or customary commercial Contracts,
the principal subject matter of which is not Taxes) that will not be
terminated on or before the Closing Date without any future liability to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(i) There are no Liens for Taxes on any of the assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries other than Liens for Taxes that are not yet due and
delinquent or that are being contested in good faith and by appropriate
proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been maintained in accordance
with GAAP. (j) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has participated in or been
a party to a transaction that, as of the date of this Agreement, constitutes a
"listed transaction" within the meaning of Section 6707A(c)(2) of the Code or
Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b).

(k) Within the last two (2) years, none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has been a "distributing corporation" or "controlled corporation"
in any transaction intended to qualify under Section 355 of the Code.

the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Law.

(o) None of the Company's Subsidiaries that are classified as "controlled

Section 3.16. Intellectual Property.

(a) Section 3.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
complete and correct list, as of the date of this Agreement, of all (i)
Company Registered IP and (ii) unregistered Trademarks included in the Company
Owned IP and material to the operation of the businesses of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For each item of Company Registered IP,
Section 3.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists the owner, country(ies)
or region, registration and application numbers.

(b) The Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries owns, or has a valid right
to use, all material Company Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of the
Company, the Company Intellectual Property is sufficient as of the Closing, in
all material respects, for the conduct of the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
respective businesses as such businesses are conducted as of the Closing. The
Surviving Corporation will own or possess sufficient rights to all material
Intellectual Property as of the Closing and immediately following the Closing
that are necessary to the operation of the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
respective businesses, as conducted as of the Closing by the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable.

(c) With respect to Company Owned IP, (x) the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries is the sole and exclusive owner of each item free and clear of
all Liens other than Permitted Liens and (y) the Company and its Subsidiaries
have taken commercially reasonable actions to maintain each item. With respect
to Company Registered IP, each item is registered in the name of the Company
or one or more of its Subsidiaries.

 (d) The rights, licenses and interests of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in and to all Company Licensed IP are free and clear of all Liens
or similar restrictions that materially restrict the use of the Company
Licensed IP where such Liens or similar restrictions are the result of an
action by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than Permitted Liens
and restrictions contained in the applicable agreements with the licensor of
such Company Licensed IP.

(e) The Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective patent counsel have not
knowingly made any material misrepresentations in the filings submitted to the
applicable Governmental Authorities with respect to all Patents included in
the Company Registered IP and, to the Knowledge of the Company, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in patent or copyright misuse
or any fraud or inequitable conduct in connection with any Company Registered
IP.

(f) None of the activities or business currently conducted by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries at any time since January 1, 2012, materially
infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates any valid and enforceable
Intellectual Property of any third Person (except that with respect to
Patents, the foregoing representation is made to the Knowledge of the
Company). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
judgment that materially restricts or impairs the use of any Company
Intellectual Property.

(g) There is not now and has not been since January 1, 2012, a pending or
threatened claim in writing or Proceeding by any Person asserting the alleged
infringement, misappropriation or violation of any Intellectual Property of
any Person by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or contesting the
validity, ownership, enforceability or right of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to exercise any Company Owned IP, including in the nature of
being offered a license or covenant not to sue, and to the Knowledge of the
Company, there is no basis for any such Proceeding with respect to valid and
enforceable Intellectual Property of any third Person. Since January 1, 2012,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
notice of any pending conflict with, or infringement, misappropriation or
violation of the rights of any Person with respect to any Intellectual
Property or with respect to any license of the Company Intellectual Property,
or challenging the validity, ownership, enforceability, or right of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to use any of the Company Intellectual
Property.

(h) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has asserted rights in any of the
Company Intellectual Property that is material to the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, against any Person in any cease and
desist letter or other written notice, including in the nature of offering a
license or covenant not to sue.

(i) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have at all times taken
reasonable measures to protect and preserve the confidentiality of all
material confidential information and Trade Secrets that are Company Owned IP,
or any Trade Secrets disclosed to the Company or its Subsidiaries for which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries had or has an obligation of secrecy,
against unauthorized access, disclosure, use, modification or other misuse. To
the Knowledge of the Company, there has been no material unauthorized access,
disclosure or use of any material Trade Secrets that are Company Owned IP, or
any Trade Secrets disclosed to the Company or its Subsidiaries for which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries had or has an obligation of secrecy,
against unauthorized access, disclosure, use, modification or other misuse. (j) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the Company
and its Subsidiaries at all times have used reasonable measures to protect the
material Trade Secrets that are part of the Company Intellectual Property and
have secured from all of their employees and consultants who independently or
jointly contributed to the conception, reduction to practice, creation or
development of any Company Owned IP, unencumbered and unrestricted exclusive
ownership of all such employee's or consultant's, as applicable, Intellectual
Property in such contribution that the Company or its Subsidiaries does not
already own by operation of Law and such employee or consultant, as
applicable, has not retained any rights or licenses with respect thereto.
Without limiting the foregoing, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be material to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have obtained
proprietary information and invention disclosure and assignment Contracts from
all current and former employees and consultants, and those Contracts assign
and require any assignment to the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries
all right, title and interest in and to Intellectual Property developed by
such employees and consultants in their capacity as employee or consultant, as
applicable, except with respect to any Intellectual Property that vests in the
Company or its Subsidiaries by operation of Law.

(k) No item of Company Registered IP has been held to be invalid or
unenforceable in a court decision that is unappealed or unappealable by the
Company. The Company Owned IP (and, to the Knowledge of the Company, the
Company Licensed IP) is subsisting (or in the case of applications, applied
for) and to the Knowledge of the Company, valid and enforceable; provided,
however, that this Section 3.16(k) shall not be interpreted to give any
representation, warranty or other assurance that any Patent applications or
Trademark applications that are part of the Company Intellectual Property will
issue or be granted.

(l) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have at all times been in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws (including the EU
General Data Protection Regulation) relating to privacy, data protection and
collection and use of personal information to which the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries have had access or have collected, used or held for use in the
conduct of its business. No claims are pending or have been threatened in
writing or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened other than in writing,
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries alleging a violation of any
third Person's privacy, personal information or data rights.

(m) There are no settlements, forbearances to sue, consents, Orders or similar
obligations to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is
subject that (i) restrict the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' rights to
use, enjoy or exploit any material Company Intellectual Property; (ii)
materially restrict the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' business in
order to accommodate a third Person's Intellectual Property; or (iii) permit
third Persons to use any material Company Intellectual Property.





 (n) Other than in connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has entered into any contractual obligation requiring it to
indemnify any other Person against infringement or other violation of any
Intellectual Property of any third Person, nor has the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries entered into any contractual obligation requiring the Company or
one of its Subsidiaries to grant any Person the right to bring infringement
actions or otherwise enforce rights with respect to any of the Company Owned
IP.

(o) To the Knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2015, no current or
former employee or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (x) is
in violation of any (A) term or covenant of any contractual or other
obligation to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to invention
disclosure, invention assignment, non-disclosure or non-competition, or (B)
any applicable material non-disclosure obligation or restrictive covenant
obligation for the benefit of any former employer of such employee or
consultant, by virtue of such employee or consultant being employed by or
performing services for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or using Trade
Secrets or proprietary information of such former employer for the benefit of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (y) has developed any technology,
Software or other copyrightable, patentable or otherwise proprietary work for
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is subject to any agreement under
which such employee or consultant has assigned or otherwise granted to any
third Person any rights (including Intellectual Property rights) in or to such
technology, Software or other copyrightable, patentable or otherwise
proprietary work. To the Knowledge of the Company, all disclosures by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a third Person of material Company-owned
confidential information and Trade Secrets, or confidential information and
Trade Secrets as to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries had or has an
obligation of secrecy, have been pursuant to the terms of a written
contractual obligation between the Company or its applicable Subsidiaries and
such third Person.

(p) With regard to proprietary Software that is used by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or is currently in development by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries: (i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
assigned, delivered, licensed or made available, and does not have any
obligation to assign, deliver, license or make available, the source code for
any such Software to any third Person, including any escrow agent or similar
Person; (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has experienced
any material defects or disruptions in such Software, including any material
error or omission in the processing of any transactions that have not been
corrected; (iii) no such Software (A) contains any code designed or intended
to disrupt, disable, harm or otherwise impede in any manner the operation of,
or provide unauthorized access to, a computer system or network or other
device on which such code is stored or installed, or to damage or destroy data
or files without the user's consent, or (B) is subject to the terms of any
"open source" or other similar license that provides for the proprietary
portions of such source code of the Software to, upon distribution to third
parties, be disclosed, licensed, publicly distributed or dedicated to the
public; (iv) current copies of the source code for all such material Software
are recorded on machine readable media, clearly identified and securely stored
(together with the applicable documentation) by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; and (v) no capital expenditures are necessary with respect to
such Software or its use other than capital expenditures in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice. During the three (3) years
prior to the date hereof, (A) there have been no material security breaches in
the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' information technology systems and (B) there have been no disruptions in the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' information technology systems that materially adversely
affected the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' business or operations. The
Company has used commercially reasonable efforts to evaluate the disaster
recovery and backup needs of the Company and its Subsidiaries and has
implemented plans and systems that are reasonably designed to address its
assessment risk.

(q) No issued Patents or pending patent applications that are Company Owned IP
are involved in any interference, reissue, reexamination, opposition, inter
partes review, covered business method review, post-grant review, or other
post-grant proceeding. No Trademark that is Company Owned IP is involved in
any opposition, invalidation, cancellation, or other administrative
proceeding. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is undertaking any
interference, reissue, reexamination, opposition, inter partes review, covered
business method review, post-grant review, invalidation, cancellation, or
other administrative proceeding with respect to Intellectual Property of any
third Person.

(r) No material Company Intellectual Property is being used or enforced by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to result in the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of any
Intellectual Property used in and necessary for or otherwise material to the
conduct of the Company's and any of its Subsidiaries' businesses as currently
conducted.

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries do not own any real property.

occupies any real property from any other Person (whether as a tenant,
subtenant or pursuant to other occupancy arrangements) (collectively, the
"Company Leased Real Propertyˮ). The Company has made available to Parent a
true, correct and complete copy of each such Lease to date.

(c) Except as where such failure would not, individually or in the aggregate,

such other party, as the case may be, is in default under such Lease, and to
the Knowledge of the Company, no other counterparty is in default under such
Lease. No event has occurred and no condition exists, which with the giving of
notice or the passage of time, or both, will constitute a default under a
Lease by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any counterparty under such Lease, that would, individually or in the
aggregate, materially impair or be reasonably likely to materially impair the
continued use and operations of the Company Leased Real Property to which they
relate in the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
presently conducted.

(f) Except as where such failure would not, individually or in the aggregate,
materially impair or be reasonably likely to materially impair the continued

Company, possesses, uses or occupies all or any portion of any Company Leased

any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, will (i) violate any
provision of the Parent Organizational Documents, (ii) assuming that the
Consents, registrations, declarations, filings and notices referenced in
Section 4.3(b) have been obtained or made, conflict with or violate any Law
applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or by which any property or asset of Parent

Consent of, notice to or filing with any third Person pursuant to any of the
terms or provisions of any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party
or by which any property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub is bound, or result
in the creation of a Lien, other than any Permitted Lien, upon any of the
property or assets of Parent or Merger Sub, other than, in the case of clauses
(ii) and (iii), as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

obtained or made would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or any asset or property of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, and (b) there is no Order outstanding against, or involving,
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any asset or property of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries that, in each case of clauses (a) and (b), would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

Section 4.5. Information Supplied. None of the information with respect to
Parent and its Subsidiaries that is or will be furnished to the Company by or
on behalf of Parent in writing specifically for use in the Proxy Statement
will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading at the time such Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at
the time of the Company Stockholders' Meeting.

Section 4.6. Brokers. No investment banker, broker, finder or other
intermediary other than Citigroup Global Markets Inc., the fees and expenses

arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

Section 4.7. Sufficient Funds. Parent will have, as of the Closing Date,
sufficient cash to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that require payment in connection with the

for the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.8. Merger Sub. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct

prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 4.9. No Interested Stockholder. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any "affiliate" or "associate" (as each such term is defined
in Section 203 of the DGCL and Article X of the Certificate of Incorporation)
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, is, or has been at any time during the
period commencing three (3) years prior to the date hereof through the date
hereof, an "interested stockholder" (as such term is defined in Section 203 of
the DGCL and Article X of the Certificate of Incorporation) of the Company.
None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their controlled Affiliates directly or
indirectly beneficially owns any Company Common Stock, other than shares
beneficially owned through benefit or pension plans.

made, any representations or warranties relating to itself or its business or
otherwise in connection with the Merger and Parent and Merger Sub are not

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to make any

connection with the Merger, and if made, such representation or warranty must
not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub as having been authorized by such
party and (c) except to the extent the subject of any representation or
warranty expressly set forth in Article III, any estimates, projections,
predictions, data, financial information, memoranda, presentations or other
materials or information provided to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
representatives are not, and shall not be deemed to be or include,

Change in accordance with Section 5.5(e), the Company shall, through the
Company Board, make the Company Recommendation, and shall include such Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in

lawfully request and the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
reasonably necessary to consummate the Merger and any other transactions to be
performed or consummated by such party in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and to carry out fully the purposes of this Agreement. Each of the
parties hereto shall as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of
this Agreement, upon a date to be mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto
(and in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement, unless agreed otherwise by the parties hereto), make its respective
filings under the HSR Act. Each of the parties hereto shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, upon a date to be
mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto, make any other applications and
filings as reasonably determined by the Company and Parent under other
applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later
than as required by Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to, and without the prior written consent of
Parent, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates will,
grant or offer to grant any accommodation or concession (financial or
otherwise), or make any payment, to any third Person in connection with
seeking or obtaining its consent to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (it being understood that this sentence does not apply to the
actions required by Section 5.3(d) or Section 5.3(e)).

(b) In connection with and without limiting the efforts referenced in this
Section 5.3, each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation of any required governmental
filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any investigation
or other inquiry from a Governmental Authority or in connection with any
Proceeding initiated by a private party, in each case, under any applicable
Antitrust Laws, including (i) promptly informing the other party of such
inquiry or Proceeding, (ii) consulting in advance before making any
presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, or in connection
with any such Proceeding, to any other Person, and supplying each other with
copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications between
either party and any Governmental Authority, or in connection with any such
Proceeding, between either party and any other Person with respect to this
Agreement and (iii) providing the other party with a reasonable advance
opportunity to review and comment upon and consider in good faith the views of
the other in connection with all written communications (including any
analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals)
between either party and any Governmental Authority, or in connection with any
such Proceeding, between either party and any other Person with respect to
this Agreement; provided that materials required to be provided by one party
to another pursuant to this Section 5.3(b) may be redacted (i) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company, (ii) as necessary to
comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address
reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns or
may be provided on an outside counsel basis, if reasonably appropriate. In
addition, each of the parties hereto will give reasonable notice to and
consult with the other in advance of any meeting or substantive telephone call
or conference with any Governmental Authority, or in connection with any such
Proceeding, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the
Governmental Authority, give the other the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meeting, telephone call or conference.

(c) The parties shall consult with each other with respect to obtaining all
permits and Consents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger.









 (d) Subject to the limitations set forth below in Section 5.3(e), Parent
agrees to take, or cause to be taken (including by its Subsidiaries), any and
all steps and to make, or cause to be made (including by its Subsidiaries),
any and all undertakings necessary to resolve such objections, if any, that a
Governmental Authority may assert under any Antitrust Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to avoid or eliminate any
impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in
each case, so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and
in any event no later than the Termination Date, including (x) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any businesses,
assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of the Company, (y)
creating, terminating, or divesting relationships, ventures, contractual
rights or obligations of the Company and (z) otherwise taking or committing to
take any action that would limit Parent's freedom of action with respect to,
or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses,
assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of the Company, in each
case as may be required in order to obtain all expirations or terminations of
waiting periods required under any Antitrust Law or to avoid the commencement
of any action by a Governmental Authority to prohibit the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement under any Antitrust Law, or, in the alternative,
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other Order in any action or proceeding seeking
to prohibit the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or delay the
Closing beyond the Termination Date. To assist Parent in complying with its
obligations set forth in this Section 5.3(d), the Company shall enter into one
or more agreements requested by Parent to be entered into by any of them prior
to the Closing with respect to any transaction to divest, hold separate or
otherwise take any action that limits the Company's freedom of action,
ownership or control with respect to, or their ability to retain or hold,
directly or indirectly, any of the businesses, assets, equity interests,
product lines or properties of the Company (each, a "Divestiture Action");
provided, however, that the consummation of the transactions provided for in
any such agreement for a Divestiture Action shall be conditioned upon the
Closing or satisfaction of all of the conditions to Closing in a case where
the Closing will occur immediately following such Divestiture Action (and
where Parent has irrevocably committed to effect the Closing immediately
following such Divestiture Action).

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of Parent
or any of its Affiliates shall be required to take any Divestiture Action or
otherwise agree to or proffer to sell, divest, hold separate, lease, license,
transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or impair or take any other action
with respect to Parent's or any of its Affiliates' ability to own or operate
any assets, properties, businesses or product lines of Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Securities of the
Company or its Subsidiaries) or, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
any assets, properties, businesses or product lines of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that none of Parent or any of its
Affiliates shall be required to take any action contemplated in Section 5.3(d)
or this Section 5.3(e) in connection with any Proceeding by a Person other
than a Governmental Authority, and the Company shall not, and shall not cause
or permit any of its Subsidiaries to, unless requested to do so by Parent,
commit to or effect any action contemplated in Section 5.3(d) or this Section
5.3(e). Section 5.4. Access to Information; Confidentiality. From the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and Merger Sub, and their respective
Representatives, reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, to all of the officers, employees, agents, properties,
books, contracts and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and during
such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
furnish reasonably promptly all other information concerning the business,
properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or
Merger Sub may reasonably request. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
provided herein, the Company may restrict or prohibit such access to the
extent that (a) any applicable Law requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to
restrict or prohibit such access, (b) granting such access would violate any
Contract or material obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
a third Person with respect to confidentiality or otherwise breach, contravene
or violate, constitute a default under, or give a third Person the right to
terminate or accelerate any obligations under, any then-effective Contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or would disclose any
information that is competitively sensitive or (c) granting access to such
documents or information would reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of
any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege in respect of such documents or information, provided, however, that
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate the
applicable information to Parent in a way that would not violate the
applicable Law, Contract or material obligation or waive such privilege or
work-product doctrine. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub will
hold any information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.4 in accordance with
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation pursuant to this
Section 5.4 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made by the Company hereunder. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide any access or make
any disclosure to Parent pursuant to this Section 5.4 to the extent such
access or information is reasonably pertinent to a litigation where the
Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties.

Section 5.5. No Solicitation.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time
and the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Section 7.1, except as expressly provided in Section 5.5(b) or Section 5.5(d),
(i) the Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and instruct its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives
to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all existing activities,
discussions, negotiations and communications, if any, with any Persons (or any
of their Representatives) with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal
(other than Parent or any of its Affiliates or Representatives with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); (ii) the Company shall not,
and shall not permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries'
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (A) initiate, seek, solicit,
knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage, or knowingly induce or take any
other action designed or intended to lead to, or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to any inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or
announcement of, any Company Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any negotiations or discussions with, or furnish or
cause to be furnished any information or data to, or furnish access to the
Company's (or any of its Subsidiaries') properties with respect to, any Person
(other than Parent or any of its Affiliates or Representatives) relating to
any Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected
to lead to any Company Acquisition Proposal (other than informing any Persons
of the provisions of this Section 5.5), or grant any waiver or release under
(or terminate, amend or modify any provision of), or fail to use reasonable
best efforts to enforce to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
any confidentiality or standstill or similar agreement (except that if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
outside legal counsel, that the failure to grant any waiver or release would
be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, the Company may waive any such standstill provision solely to the extent
necessary to permit a third Person to make a Company Acquisition Proposal),
(C) execute or enter into any binding or non-binding letter of intent,
agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other agreement, commitment, arrangement or understanding
relating to or in connection with, or that is intended to or would reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal (each, an
"Alternative Acquisition Agreementˮ), (D) submit to the stockholders of the
Company for their approval any Company Acquisition Proposal or Company
Superior Proposal, or (E) resolve to do, or agree or announce an intention to
do, any of the foregoing; (iii) the Company shall not provide (and will not
permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives to
provide) and shall promptly, and in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours
of the date of this Agreement, terminate access of any third Person (and its
Representatives) (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives) to any data room (virtual or actual) containing any of the
Company's (or any Subsidiary of the Company's) confidential information
granted in connection with, or with the intent of obtaining, any possible
Company Acquisition Proposal; and (iv) the Company, to the extent it has a
right to do so, shall, and shall instruct its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries' Representatives to, use their respective reasonable best efforts
to request that any such third Person (and its Representatives) (other than
Parent or any of its Affiliates or Representatives) in possession of
confidential information about the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or its
or its Subsidiaries' businesses or operations) return or destroy all such
information, and in connection therewith the Company shall, to the extent it
has a right to do so, within twenty-four (24) hours of the date of this
Agreement, demand the return or destruction of all confidential information
and materials provided to any third Persons (or their Representatives) (other
than Parent or any of its Affiliates or Representatives) relating to a
possible Company Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company receives,
after the date hereof, a bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal from a
third Person that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.5, then the
Company may (i) furnish information concerning its business, properties or
assets to such Person pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (a
copy of which shall be provided to Parent promptly after execution) and (ii)
negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person
concerning such Company Acquisition Proposal, in each case of clause (i) and
(ii), if and only if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with the Company's financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
that (x) such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to lead to or result in a Company Superior Proposal and (y) the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Board's
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Company (A) shall promptly (and in
any case within twenty-four (24) hours) provide Parent notice (1) of the
receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include, if
applicable, a complete, unredacted copy of such Company Acquisition Proposal, and (2) of any inquiries, proposals or offers
received by, any requests for information from, or any discussions or
negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or its Subsidiaries' Representatives concerning a
Company Acquisition Proposal or proposal that is reasonably likely to
constitute or lead to or result in a Company Acquisition Proposal, and
disclose the identity of the other party (or parties) and, if applicable, the
terms (including any amendments thereto) of such inquiry, offer, proposal,
request, discussion or negotiation and, in the case of written materials,
provide copies of such materials, (B) shall substantially concurrently (and in
any case within twenty-four (24) hours) make available to Parent all
information, including copies of all written materials, provided by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or its Subsidiaries' Representatives
to such party but not previously made available to Parent and (C) shall keep
Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably prompt basis (and, in any case,
within twenty-four (24) hours of any significant development, discussions or
negotiations) of the status and details (including amendments and proposed
amendments) of any such Company Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, offer,
proposal, request, discussion or negotiation (which shall include, if
applicable, copies of all drafts and final versions (and any comments thereon)
of agreements (including schedules and exhibits thereto) relating to any
Company Acquisition Proposal exchanged between the Company or its Subsidiaries
or any of its or its Subsidiaries' Representatives in each case thereof, on
the one hand, and the Person (or any of its Representatives) making such
Company Acquisition Proposal or such other inquiry, offer or proposal, on the
other hand).

(c) Except as expressly permitted by Section 5.5(d) or Section 5.5(e), neither
the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify
or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (ii)
approve, authorize, declare advisable, endorse or recommend (or publicly
propose to approve, authorize, declare advisable, endorse or recommend) any
Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to include in the Proxy Statement the
Company Recommendation, (iv) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company
Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of a written request
by Parent to provide such reaffirmation following public disclosure of any
Company Acquisition Proposal, (v) fail to recommend against any Company
Acquisition Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer subject to Regulation
14D under the Exchange Act in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of such tender or exchange
offer (any action described in clauses (i) through (v) of this sentence being
referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Changeˮ) or (vi) adopt or
approve, or propose to adopt or approve, or allow the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any Alternative Acquisition Agreement
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement permitted under, and in
compliance with Section 5.5(b)).

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company or the
Company Board receives a Company Superior Proposal, the Company Board may
authorize and cause the Company to (x) effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change and (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) and
concurrently with such termination enter into a definitive agreement providing
for such Company Superior Proposal (subject to the satisfaction of its
obligations under Section 7.3) if (i) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; (ii) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it
intends to take such action; (iii) the Company has provided Parent a copy of
the proposed definitive agreements (and any related agreements) relating to
such Company Superior Proposal (and has informed Parent of the identity of the
Person making such Company Superior Proposal); (iv) until 11:59 p.m., New York
City time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day following the notice delivered
pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 5.5(d), the Company and its
Representatives shall have discussed and negotiated with Parent in good faith
(to the extent Parent requests to negotiate) any proposed modifications to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that
any amendment to any material term or condition of any Company Superior
Proposal shall require a new notice and a new negotiation period, which shall
expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the second (2nd) Business Day
following the delivery of such new notice); and (v) no earlier than the end of
such negotiation period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with the Company's financial advisor and outside legal
counsel), after considering and taking into account the terms of any proposed
amendment or modification to this Agreement made by Parent in writing during
such period, that (A) the Company Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of
the notice described in clause (ii) above still constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal and (B) the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, other than in
connection with a Company Superior Proposal (which shall be subject to Section
5.5(d) and shall not be subject to this Section 5.5(e)), prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, in response to a
Company Intervening Event, effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if
(i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Company's outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
(ii) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect such
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.5(e) (which
notice shall reasonably specify the facts and circumstances providing the
basis of the Company Intervening Event and for the Company Board's
determination to effect the Company Adverse Recommendation Change in detail);
(iii) until 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day
following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 5.5(e),
the Company and its Representatives shall have discussed and negotiated with
Parent in good faith any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement (to the extent Parent requests to negotiate) (it being
understood and agreed that any material change to the relevant facts and
circumstances shall require a new notice and a new negotiation period, which
shall expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the second (2nd) Business
Day following the delivery of such new notice); and (iv) no earlier than the
end of such negotiation period, the Company Board shall have determined in
good faith (after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel),
after considering and taking into account the terms of any proposed amendment
or modification to this Agreement made by Parent in writing during such
period, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law.



 (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; provided, however, that (A) in no event shall this
Section 5.5(f) permit the Company or the Company Board to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change except as otherwise permitted pursuant to
Section 5.5(d) or Section 5.5(e), (B) in no event shall this Section 5.5(f)
affect, modify or supplement the definition of Company Adverse Recommendation
Change herein (or to the consequences thereof in accordance with this
Agreement) and (C) any such disclosure (other than issuance by the Company of
a "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) that does not expressly reaffirm the Company
Recommendation shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change;
provided further that any factually accurate public statement that describes
the Company's receipt of a Company Acquisition Proposal and the operation of
this Agreement with respect thereto and expressly reaffirms the Company
Recommendation shall not be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change. The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the text of any
disclosure proposed to be made pursuant to this Section 5.5(f) at the earliest
practicable time in advance of such disclosure.

Section 5.6. Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities, including advancement of expenses, for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of
the directors or officers of the Company at or prior to the Effective Time
(the "DandO Indemnified Parties") as provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation, the Bylaws or any indemnification Contract between such
directors or officers and the Company (in each case, as in effect on the date
of this Agreement) shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses equivalent to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time solely with
respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time and shall
not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Parties;
provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any action
pending or asserted or any claim made for indemnification within such period
shall continue until the disposition of such action or resolution of such
claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall guarantee and stand
surety for, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance
with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section
5.6.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of or after the
Effective Time to, purchase a six (6)-year prepaid "tail" policy, with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided under the Company's existing policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance, with respect
to matters arising on or before the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions or actions contemplated by this Agreement), and Parent shall
cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full
term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase
or pay for insurance hereunder; provided, however, that the Company shall not
pay, and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay, in excess of
300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement in respect of such "tail" policy. If the Company or the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies prior
to, as of or after the Effective Time, Parent shall, for a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time, cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in
effect the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company with respect to
matters arising on or before the Effective Time; provided, further, however,
that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company
prior to the date of this Agreement in respect of the coverage required to be
obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount.

(c) The covenants contained in this Section 5.6 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which any such Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract
or otherwise.

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors or assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.6.

Section 5.7. Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose
occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may be, could reasonably be expected
to cause any condition set forth in Section 6.2 not to be satisfied at any
time from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time; (b) any notice or
other communication from any third Person alleging that the consent of such
third Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (c) any material regulatory
notice, report or results of inspection from the FDA or any similar
Governmental Authority. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of (i)
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose occurrence or non-
occurrence, as the case may be, could reasonably be expected to cause any
condition set forth in Section 6.3 not to be satisfied at any time from the
date of this Agreement to the Effective Time; and (ii) any notice or other
communication from any third Person alleging that the consent of such third
Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties hereto or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto hereunder and any
failure to give such notice with respect to clauses (b) or (c) above, or (ii)
or (iii) above, as applicable, shall not constitute a breach of this Section
5.7 for purposes of Section 6.2(b) or Section 6.3(b). Except with respect to
Antitrust Law, which is the subject of Section 5.3, the Company and Parent
shall, to the extent permitted by Law, promptly provide the other with copies
of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Authority in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 5.8. Public Disclosure. Parent and the Company shall mutually agree on
the initial press release or releases with respect to the execution of this
Agreement. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect, except as
otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement, neither the Company nor
Parent, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall issue any press release
or other announcement with respect to the Merger, the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or this Agreement without the prior consent of
the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), except as such
press release or other announcement may be required by Law or the rules of a
national securities exchange or trading market on which such party's
Securities are listed, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide the other party
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such release or
announcement in advance of its issuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a)
the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.8 shall not apply to any press
release or other announcement (i) made by the Company with respect to or in
connection with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change effected by the
Company Board in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) made by the Company or
Parent concerning this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby in connection with a determination by the Company or the
Company Board in accordance with Section 5.5(b) or Section 5.5(d) that a
Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to
constitute, a Company Superior Proposal or any dispute between the parties
regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby,
provided, however, that in the case of the preceding clause (i) or (ii), to
the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, the disclosing party gives the
other party reasonable advance notice of (including contents of) its intended
press release or other announcement, and (b) to the extent the content of any
press release or other announcement has been previously approved and made in
accordance with this Section 5.8, no separate approval shall be required in
respect of such content to the extent such content is substantially replicated
in a subsequent press release or other announcement or substantially
consistent with a previously approved press release or announcement.

Section 5.9. Intellectual Property Matters. The Company shall, prior to the
Closing use all reasonable efforts to ensure that title in all Company
Registered IP is recorded in the name of the Company or one or more of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and to the extent that any such Company
Registered IP is recorded in any governmental registry in the name of any
Person other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or there are
outstanding encumbrances of any type against such Company Registered IP, use
all reasonable efforts to obtain appropriate assignments, discharges or other
documents intended to place record ownership in the name of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and/or effect the discharge prior to the Closing, as
applicable. Without limiting Section 5.1(o), the Company shall use all
reasonable efforts to ensure that all maintenance, annuity and other fees and
all filings necessary to assure the continued enjoyment of any issued Company
Registered IP, and all amendments, responses to office actions, issue fees and
other fees and filings necessary to maintain the pendency of and pursue the
prosecution of any pending applications, including the filing of continuation
applications, have been and will be paid or filed on a timely basis through
the Closing. Section 5.10. Employee Matters.

(a) For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the earlier
of (x) the date that is twelve (12) months following the Effective Time and
(y) the date on which the employment of an employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries who continues his or her employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates following the
Effective Time (each, a "Continuing Employeeˮ) terminates, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates shall provide each
Continuing Employee with (i) an annual base salary, at least equal to the
annual base salary, provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (ii) cash bonus and cash incentive opportunities that are
no less favorable than the cash bonus and cash incentive opportunities
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates, and
(iii) employee benefits that are no less favorable (in the aggregate) to the
employee benefits (including severance benefits but excluding for such
purposes any equity or equity-related awards, and any defined benefit pension
benefits) provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Affiliates.

(b) If the Closing occurs (i) prior to the completion of the 2018 fiscal year
or (ii) after the completion of the 2018 fiscal year but prior to the payment
of bonuses with respect to such fiscal year, Parent or its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) shall pay an annual bonus under the
applicable bonus plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of the
2018 fiscal year to each eligible employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries based on actual performance levels as of the date of this
Agreement, extrapolated through the last day of the 2018 fiscal year, which
payment shall be made at the time such bonuses would ordinarily be paid to
eligible employees by the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms
of such plans and in compliance with Section 409A of the Code; provided that
if such employee is terminated by the Company or its Subsidiaries without
cause prior to the payment date, such bonus shall be paid on such employee's
termination date. If the Closing occurs during the 2019 fiscal year, Parent or
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) shall pay a pro-rated
annual bonus under the applicable bonus plans of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in respect of the portion of the 2019 fiscal year that occurs
prior to the Closing Date to each eligible employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries based on target level performance through the Closing Date,
which payment will be made at the time such bonuses would ordinarily be paid
by the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of such plans, but
in no event later than the end of the first quarter of 2020 or such earlier
date as may be required to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

(c) Parent agrees that each Continuing Employee shall, as of the Effective
Time, receive full credit for service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accrual under the employee
benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Affiliates in which such Continuing Employee becomes a
participant (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any
defined benefit pension plan); provided, however, that nothing herein shall
result in the duplication of any benefits for the same period of service. With
respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates for the benefit of
Continuing Employees (including any medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision
benefit plans), Parent shall (i) cause to be waived any eligibility waiting
periods, any evidence of insurability requirements or required physical
examinations, actively-at-work requirements and the application of any pre-
existing condition limitations under such plan to the extent such were waived or satisfied under the comparable health or
welfare benefit plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) cause each Continuing Employee to be
given credit under such plan for all amounts paid (or otherwise deemed paid)
by such Continuing Employee under any similar Benefit Plan for the plan year
that includes the Effective Time for purposes of applying deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the plans maintained by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, as
applicable, for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs; provided,
however, that Parent's obligations under this clause (ii) shall be subject to
its receipt of all necessary information, from either the Company or such
Continuing Employee, related to such amounts paid by such Continuing Employee.

(d) Unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate, effective as of
at least one (1) day prior to the Closing Date, any and all Benefit Plans
intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a "Company 401(k)
Planˮ). No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that the Company has taken action
to terminate each Company 401(k) Plan (effective as of no later than one (1)
day prior to the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board,
as the case may be. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be
subject to review and approval of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this Section
5.10 shall create such rights in any such Persons. Nothing herein shall (i)
guarantee employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, as
applicable, to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time
and for any reason; (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates, as applicable, to continue any Benefit Plans, or
other employee benefit plans or arrangements or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; or (iii) amend
any Benefit Plans or other employee benefit plans or arrangements.

Section 5.11. Merger Sub. Parent will take all actions necessary to cause
Merger Sub to comply with and perform all of its obligations under or relating
to this Agreement, including in the case of Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Section 5.12. Rule 16b-3 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to take all such steps as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable (to the extent permitted under applicable Law and no-
action letters issued by the SEC) to cause any dispositions of Company Common
Stock (including derivative Securities with respect to Company Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Section 5.13. Repayment and Termination of Existing Credit Agreement. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent, at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a draft of, and on or prior
to the Closing Date, an executed copy of, a customary payoff letter from the
agents under the Existing Credit Agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent relating to the repayment in full of all obligations
thereunder or secured thereby, the termination of all commitments in
connection therewith and the release of all Liens securing the obligations
thereunder (the "Payoff Letterˮ). The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent (or the
agent under the Existing Credit Agreement, in the case of prepayment and
termination notices) on or prior to the Closing, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, all the documents, filings and notices
required for the termination of commitments under the Existing Credit
Agreement and the release of all Liens securing the obligations thereunder,
including the filing of UCC releases, termination of control agreements, and
delivery of possessory collateral, which shall in each case be subject to the
occurrence of the Closing and the repayment in full of all obligations then
outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement. At the Closing, Parent shall
pay or shall cause to be paid, in full and in immediately available funds, any
and all amounts outstanding and then due and payable under the Existing Credit
Agreement in accordance with the Payoff Letter.

Section 5.14. Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under Laws and rules
and policies of NASDAQ to cause the delisting of the Company and of the shares
of Company Common Stock from NASDAQ as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time and the deregistration of the shares of Company Common Stock
under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting. The
Company shall not cause the Company Common Stock to be delisted from NASDAQ
prior to the Effective Time. If the Surviving Corporation is required to file
any quarterly or annual report by a filing deadline that is imposed by the
Exchange Act which falls on a date within the ten (10) days following the
Closing Date, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to
Parent at or prior to the Closing a substantially final draft of any such
annual or quarterly report reasonably likely to be required to be filed during
such period.

Section 5.15. State Takeover Laws. If any state takeover statute becomes or is
deemed to become applicable to the Company or the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company Board shall take
any and all actions within its control as are necessary to render such
statutes inapplicable to the foregoing.

Section 5.16. Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent notice as
soon as possible of, and the opportunity to participate in (subject to a
customary joint defense agreement), but not control, the defense or settlement
of, any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or
executive officers relating to or in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether
commenced prior to or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement. The
Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to compromise or settle any
such litigation commenced prior to or after the date of this Agreement against
the Company or any of its directors or executive officers relating to or in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case, without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned). Section 5.17. Resignations. Prior to the Effective Time, upon Parent's
request, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any director
of the Company and each subsidiary of the Company to execute and deliver a
letter effectuating his or her resignation as a director of such entity
effective as of the Effective Time.

Section 5.18. Convertible Note Indentures.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such actions as
may be required in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of the
applicable Convertible Note Indenture or under applicable Law, including the
giving of any notices that may be required in connection with the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement and any repurchases or
conversions of the Convertible Notes issued under the applicable Convertible
Note Indenture occurring as a result of, or in connection with, with the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement. In addition,
following the occurrence of any event that would require an adjustment to the
Conversion Rate under any Convertible Note Indenture, the Company shall
promptly provide Parent written notice accurately setting out (i) the updated
Conversion Rate for each Convertible Note Indenture and (ii) the number of
Additional Shares (as defined in the applicable Convertible Note Indenture),
if any, by which such Conversion Rate will be increased upon the occurrence of
a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the applicable Convertible Note
Indenture), in each case, as adjusted to reflect all events that have occurred
through the date on which such update is provided that would result in an
adjustment pursuant to the terms of the applicable Convertible Note Indenture.

(b) The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any notices, certificates, press releases, supplemental
indentures, legal opinions, officers' certificates, written or verbal
responses to any substantive inquiries from holders of the Convertible Notes
or other documents or instruments deliverable pursuant to or in connection
with the Convertible Note Indentures prior to the dispatch or making thereof,
and the Company shall promptly respond to any reasonable questions from, and
reflect any reasonable comments made by, Parent or its counsel with respect
thereto prior to the dispatch or making thereof.

(c) On or after the date hereof, the Company shall not elect a Settlement
Method under the Convertible Note Indentures other than the Default Settlement
Method as of the date hereof without the written consent of Parent.

(d) Capitalized terms in this Section 5.18 that are not otherwise defined in
this Agreement shall have the meaning given them in the applicable Convertible
Note Indenture.

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

Section 7.1. Termination. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained (except as otherwise expressly noted), as follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of each of Parent and the Company; or

(b) by either Parent or the Company:

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before 5:00 P.M. (New
York City time) on August 29, 2019 (the "Termination Date"); provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party if the failure of such party to
perform or comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement in any
material respect has been the principal cause of or principally resulted in
the failure of the Closing to have occurred on or before the Termination Date;

(ii) if any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued
or entered any Order after the date of this Agreement or any Law shall have
been enacted or promulgated after the date of this Agreement that has the
effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
Merger or other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and in the case
of such an Order, such Order shall have become final and non-appealable;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 7.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to a party if the failure of such
party to perform or comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement in
any material respect has been the principal cause of or principally resulted
in the issuance of such Order; or

(iii) if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained upon a
vote taken thereon at the Company Stockholders' Meeting duly convened therefor
or at any adjournment or postponement thereof at which a vote on the adoption
of this Agreement was taken. (c) by the Company:

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of
their respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would
result in the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section
6.3(b) and (B) is not capable of being cured by Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, by the Termination Date or, if capable of being cured, shall not
have been cured by Parent or Merger Sub on or before the earlier of (x) the
Termination Date and (y) the date that is thirty (30) calendar days following
the Company's delivery of written notice to Parent of such breach or failure
to perform; provided, however, that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(i) if the Company is
then in material breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement so as
to result in the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(b); or

(ii) at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in
order for the Company to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Company Superior Proposal to the extent permitted by, and subject to the
applicable terms and conditions of, Section 5.5(d); provided, however, that
immediately prior to or simultaneously with such termination, the Company pays
to Parent the Company Termination Fee (it being understood that the Company
may enter into such definitive written agreement simultaneously with such
termination of this Agreement).

(d) by Parent:

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would result in the failure
of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) and (B) is not
capable of being cured by the Company by the Termination Date or, if capable
of being cured, shall not have been cured by the Company on or before the
earlier of (x) the Termination Date and (y) the date that is thirty (30)
calendar days following Parent's delivery of written notice to the Company of
such breach or failure to perform; provided, however, that Parent shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(d)(i)
if Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its obligations
under this Agreement so as to result in the failure of a condition set forth
in Section 6.3(b); or

(ii) if (A) the Company Board shall have made a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or (B) the Company or the Company Board, as applicable, shall have
materially breached any of its obligations under Section 5.5(a).

Section 7.2. Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated and the Merger abandoned pursuant to Section 7.1, written notice
thereof shall be given by the terminating party to the other party, specifying
the provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this
Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and of no effect without
liability on the part of any party hereto, and all rights and obligations of
any party hereto shall cease; provided, however, that no such termination
shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any
material and intentional breach of this Agreement or fraud, in which case, the
aggrieved party shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or in equity; and provided,
further, however, that the Confidentiality Agreement, this Section 7.2,
Section 7.3, and Article VIII shall survive any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1. For purposes of this Agreement, "material and
intentional breach" shall mean an action or omission taken or omitted to be
taken that the breaching party intentionally takes (or fails to take) and
knows would, or knows would reasonably be expected to, cause a material breach
of this Agreement. The failure of Parent or Merger Sub, for any reason, to
have sufficient cash available on the date that the Closing is required to
occur pursuant to Section 1.2 hereof to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall
constitute a material and intentional breach of this Agreement.

Section 7.3. Termination Fees.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by:

(i) (A) Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) on the basis of a breach of a
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or (B) either Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or Section 7.1(b)(iii) and in any such
termination under clauses (A) or (B), (1) prior to such termination, a Company
Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement has been publicly
disclosed and not publicly withdrawn at least three (3) Business Days prior to
the Company Stockholders' Meeting in the case of termination pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)(iii) or is otherwise known to the Company Board and not
withdrawn (publicly, if publicly disclosed) prior to such termination in the
case of termination pursuant to either Section 7.1(d)(i) or Section 7.1(b)(i),
and (2) within twelve (12) months after any such termination under clauses (A)
or (B), any Company Acquisition Proposal is consummated or the Company enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal
(regardless of when or whether such transaction is consummated) (provided,
however, that for purposes of this Section 7.3(a)(i), the references to
"fifteen percent (15%)" in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)");

(ii) the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii); or

(iii) Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii);

then, in any such case, the Company shall pay to Parent the Company
Termination Fee.

Any payments required to be made under this Section 7.3(a) shall be made by
wire transfer of same-day funds to the account or accounts designated by
Parent, (x) in the case of clause (i) above, on the same day as the earlier of
any consummation of, or entry into a definitive agreement with respect to, the
transaction contemplated therein, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above,
immediately prior to or simultaneously with such termination and (z) in the
case of clause (iii) above, promptly, but in no event later than two (2)
Business Days after the date of such termination.



 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties hereto agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(c) The Company acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this Section
7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and (ii) without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 7.3 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit
that results in a judgment against the Company for the payment of any amount
set forth in this Section 7.3, the Company shall pay Parent its costs and
expenses in connection with such suit (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
together with interest on such amount at an annual rate equal to the prime
rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually
received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

Section 7.4. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto in writing at any time before or after receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be (i) any amendment
that by applicable Law or in accordance with the applicable rules of any stock
exchange requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without
such further approval of such stockholders nor (ii) any amendment or change
not permitted under applicable Law.

Section 7.5. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance by any other party hereto with any agreement or condition of such
party contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall only be valid if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be
bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on
the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 8.4. Interpretation; Certain Definitions.

(a) The parties hereto have participated collectively in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
collectively by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of this Agreement.

(b) The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "herewith" and
words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. References to articles, sections,
paragraphs, exhibits, annexes and schedules are to the articles, sections and
paragraphs of, and exhibits, annexes and schedules to, this Agreement, unless
otherwise specified, and the table of contents and headings in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the phrase "without limitation." Words describing the singular number shall be
deemed to include the plural and vice versa, words denoting any gender shall
be deemed to include all genders, words denoting natural persons shall be
deemed to include business entities and vice versa, and references to a Person
are also to its permitted successors and assigns. The term "or" is not
exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if." The phrases "the date of this Agreement" and "the date
hereof" and terms or phrases of similar import shall be deemed to refer to
August 29, 2018, unless the context requires otherwise. References to any
information or document being "made available" or "furnished" and words of
similar import shall include such information or document having been posted
to the "Project Gladiator 2018" online data room hosted on behalf of the
Company by Merrill DatasiteOne by 3:45 p.m. New York City time on the date of
this Agreement. Terms defined in the text of this Agreement have such meaning
throughout this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated in this Agreement, and
all terms defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings when used in any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. Any Law defined or referred to herein or in any
agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such Law as from time
to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes)
by succession of comparable successor Laws (provided, however, that for
purposes of any representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
that are made as of a specific date or dates, references to any statute shall
be deemed to refer to such statute, as amended, and to any rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case, as of such date). All
references to "dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the United States.

 Section 8.5. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority
to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

Section 8.6. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto, except that Merger Sub may assign any or
all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent, or a combination thereof, so
long as such assignment would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect and no
such assignment shall release Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, from
any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Any
attempted assignment in violation of this Section 8.6 shall be null and void.

Section 8.7. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the exhibits, annexes
and appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Company Disclosure Letter, the entire agreement, and
supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to the subject
matter hereof.

Section 8.8. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder; provided, however, that it is specifically intended
that (a) the DandO Indemnified Parties (with respect to Section 5.6 and this
Section 8.8 from and after the Effective Time) are intended third-party
beneficiaries hereof and (b) from and after the Effective Time, the holders of
other Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards are intended third-party
beneficiaries of Article II.

Section 8.9. Governing Law. This Agreement and all Proceedings (whether based
on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

Section 8.10. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy would occur in the event that any party hereto does not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breaches such provisions. Accordingly, the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, prior to any valid termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company,
on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that, prior to any valid termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Section 7.1, it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has
an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party hereto
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide, furnish or post
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction,
and each party hereby irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
provision, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.

Section 8.11. Consent to Jurisdiction.

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby, with respect to any legal claim or
Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (i) expressly and irrevocably submits, for itself and with
respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal
court within the State of Delaware), (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to
deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave
from any such courts, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any claim or
Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement except in such courts and (iv) irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so, and agrees not to assert, by way
of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any claim or Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final and
nonappealable judgment in any Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law.

(b) Each party hereto irrevocably consents to the service of process in any
claim or Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect hereof brought by any other party hereto made by mailing
copies thereof by registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid,
return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to
Section 8.3, and such service of process shall be sufficient to confer
personal jurisdiction over such party in such claim or Proceeding and shall
otherwise constitute effective and binding service in every respect.



 Section 8.12. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, all of which shall together be considered one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by
electronic transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed
counterpart of this Agreement.

HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) BETWEEN ANY OF
