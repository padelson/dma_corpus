MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 

3.1 _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, Parent GP, Merger Sub, the Partnership, Partnership GP or any
holder of Parent securities or Partnership Units:

 

(a) All of the limited liability company interests in Merger Sub outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically converted into
the sole limited partner interest in the Partnership.

(b) The general partner interest in the Partnership issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain outstanding in the
Surviving Entity in the form set forth in the Existing Partnership Agreement,
and Partnership GP, as the holder of such general partner interest, will
continue as the sole general partner of the Surviving Entity as set forth in
the Existing Partnership Agreement. At the Effective Time, the books and
records of the Partnership will be revised to reflect that all limited
partners of the Partnership immediately prior to the Effective Time cease to
be limited partners of the Partnership pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
and that Parent is the sole limited partner of the Partnership, and the
Partnership will continue without dissolution. Immediately prior to the
Merger (but following the ATLS Merger), ATLS shall distribute all of the
equity interests in Partnership GP to TRGP, which shall immediately thereafter
contribute such interests to Parent.

 

(c) Each Partnership Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding any Excluded Units) will be converted into the
right to receive (i) 0.5846 Parent Units (the " _Equity Consideration_ ," and
such ratio, the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), which Parent Units will be duly
authorized and validly issued in accordance with applicable Laws and the
Parent Agreement, (such Parent Units described in this _clause (c)_ are
referred to herein as the " _New Common Units_ ") and (ii) cash in amount of
$1.26 (the " _Cash Consideration_ " (which shall not include any cash paid by
Parent in connection with the Class E Preferred Unit Redemption) and together
with the Equity Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, all Partnership Units owned immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the Partnership or its wholly owned Subsidiaries or by
Parent or its wholly owned Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Excluded Units_
") will automatically be cancelled and no consideration will be
received therefor.

3.2 _Rights As Unitholders; Unit Transfers_. All Partnership Units converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
3.1(c)_ will cease to be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and
will cease to exist when converted as a result of and pursuant to the Merger.
At the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate representing Partnership
Units (a " _Certificate_ ") and each holder of non-certificated Partnership
Units, represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Units_ ") will cease to be a
limited partner of the Partnership and cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive, (a) the Merger Consideration, (b) any
cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional New Common Unit in 

 



17  accordance with _Section 3.3(d)_, and (c) any distributions in accordance
with _Section 3.3(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the rights of (i) any
holder of the Partnership Phantom Units will be as set forth in _Section
3.5_, and (ii) Parent and its Subsidiaries, and the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries will be as set forth in _Section 3.1(d)_. In addition, holders
as of the relevant record date of Partnership Units outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will have continued rights to any distribution,
without interest, with respect to such Partnership Units, with a record date
occurring prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by
the Partnership with respect to such units in accordance with the terms of the
Existing Partnership Agreement and this Agreement and which remains unpaid as
of the Effective Time (a " _Regular Distribution_ "). Regular Distributions
by the Partnership are not part of the Merger Consideration, and will be paid
on the payment date set therefor to such holders of Partnership Units, whether
or not they exchange their Partnership Units, pursuant to _Section 3.3_. At
the Effective Time, the unit transfer books of the Partnership will be closed
immediately and there will be no further registration of transfers on the unit
transfer books of the Partnership with respect to Partnership Units.

3.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will appoint a
commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Partnership to
act as exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of exchanging Partnership
Units for the Merger Consideration as required by this _Article III_ (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). On the Closing Date, promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of the holders of the applicable Partnership Units, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article III_, through the Exchange Agent, New Common
Units and cash as required by this _Article III_. Parent agrees to make
available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient
to pay any distributions pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ and to make payments
in lieu of any fractional New Common Units pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_, in
each case without interest. Any cash (including as payment for any fractional
New Common Units in accordance with _Section 3.3(d)_ and any distributions
with respect to such fractional New Common Units in accordance with _Section
3.3(c)_) and New Common Units deposited with the Exchange Agent are
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent will,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions from Parent, deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be paid for Partnership Units pursuant to this
Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by  _Sections
3.3(c)_ and _3.3(d)_ , the Exchange Fund will not be used for any other
purpose.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will
instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of Partnership Units
as of the Effective Time (other than the Partnership and its Subsidiaries and
Parent and its Subsidiaries and other than any holders of Book-Entry Units)
(i) a letter of transmittal (specifying that in respect of certificated
Partnership Units, delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent, and which will be in customary form and agreed to by
Parent and the Partnership prior to the Effective Time) (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions (in customary form and agreed to by
Parent and the Partnership prior to the Effective Time) for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of Partnership Units 

 



18  represented by such Certificates. Promptly after the Effective Time, upon
surrender of Certificates, if any, for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
together with such letters of transmittal, properly completed and duly
executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to
such instructions, each holder who held Partnership Units immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than the Partnership and its Subsidiaries and
Parent and its Subsidiaries) will be entitled to receive upon surrender of the
Certificates therefor (x) New Common Units representing, in the aggregate, the
whole number of New Common Units that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ (after taking into account all Partnership Units
then held by such holder) and (y) a check in an amount equal to the aggregate
amount of the cash that such holder has the right to receive with respect to
such Partnership Units pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ and _Section 3.3(d)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
holder of Book-Entry Units shall not be required to deliver an executed
letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
_Article III_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-
Entry Units, which at the Effective Time were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, shall automatically upon the Effective Time
be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver
as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, (x) New Common Units
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of New Common Units that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ (after taking
into account all Partnership Units then held by such holder) and (y) a check
in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the cash that such holder has
the right to receive with respect to such Partnership Units pursuant to
_Section 3.3(c)_ and _Section 3.3(d)_. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any Merger Consideration, any cash payment in lieu of fractional New Common
Units, any Parent distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ or any
Regular Distribution. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Partnership
Units that is not registered in the transfer records of the Partnership or the
Merger Consideration, as applicable, and any Parent distributions payable
pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ payable in respect of such Partnership Units
may be paid to a transferee, if the Certificate representing such Partnership
Units is presented to the Exchange Agent, and accompanied by all documents
reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and the
Person requesting such exchange will pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger
Consideration, in any name other than that of the record holder of such
Partnership Units, or will establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable. Until such required
documentation has been delivered and Certificates, if any, have been
surrendered, as contemplated by this  _Section 3.3_, each Certificate will
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such delivery and surrender the Merger Consideration, payable in
respect of Partnership Units, and any cash or distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_, _Section 3.3(d)_ and
(without the necessity of such surrender) Regular Distributions.

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Partnership Units_. No
distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Units with a record
date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any Partnership
Units represented by Certificates with respect to New Common Units that such
holder would be entitled to receive in accordance herewith and no cash payment
in lieu of fractional New Common Units will be paid to any such holder until
such holder has delivered the required documentation and surrendered any such
Certificates as

 



19  contemplated by this _Section 3.3_. Subject to applicable Law, following
compliance with the requirements of _Section 3.3(b)_ (or immediately in the
case of the Book-Entry Units), there will be paid to such holder of New
Common Units issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly
after the time of such compliance (or immediately in the case of the Book-
Entry Units), the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional New Common
Units to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_ (which
shall be paid by the Exchange Agent as provided therein) and the amount of
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to New Common Units and payable with respect to such New Common
Units, and (ii) promptly after such compliance (or immediately in the case of
the Book-Entry Units), or, if later, at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to such delivery and surrender and a payment date subsequent to such
compliance payable with respect to such New Common Units (which shall be paid
by Parent). 

(d) _Fractional New Common Units_. No certificates or scrip of New Common
Units representing fractional New Common Units or book entry credit of the
same will be issued upon the surrender of Partnership Units outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with _Section 3.3(b)_,
and such fractional interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to have any rights as a holder of any New Common Units. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Partnership Units converted
in the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a New Common Unit (after taking into account all Partnership Units exchanged
by such holder) will receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest rounded
up to the nearest whole cent) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the
Average Closing Price as of the Closing Date and (ii) the fraction of a New
Common Unit that such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant
to this _Article III_. As promptly as practicable after the determination of
the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests,
Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of
fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. The
parties acknowledge that payment of the Cash Consideration in lieu of issuing
fractional shares of New Common Units was not separately bargained-for
consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be
caused by the issuance of fractional New Common Units.

(e) _Further Rights in Partnership Units_. The Merger Consideration issued
upon conversion of a Partnership Unit in accordance with the terms hereof
(including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_) and any declared
distributions to be paid on Parent Units as described in  _Section 3.3(c)_
will be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Partnership Unit.

(f)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Partnership Units after 180 days
following the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand by Parent
and, from and after such delivery, any former holders of Partnership Units
who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ will thereafter
look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration, payable in respect of such
Partnership Units, any cash in lieu of fractional New Common Units to which
they are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_, or any distributions with
respect to New Common Units to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section
3.3(c)_, in each case, without any interest thereon.

 



20 (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of an indemnity agreement or a bond, in such amount
reasonably determined by Parent, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration, payable in respect of Partnership Units represented by such
Certificate, any distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ and any cash payable in lieu of fractional New
Common Units to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to  _Section
3.3(d)_.

(h) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent are
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Partnership Units such amounts or
securities as Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent determines are required
to be deducted and withheld under the Code or any provision of state, local,
or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment or issuance. To
the extent that amounts or securities are so deducted and withheld such
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid or issued to the holder of Partnership Units in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be. The Parties agree that the Partnership intends to
deliver to Parent a valid certificate of non-foreign status pursuant to U.S.
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b) such that no withholding will be
required pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code.

 

(i) _Issuance in Book-Entry Form_. All New Common Units to be issued in the
Merger will be issued in book-entry form, without physical certificates. Upon
the issuance of New Common Units to the holders of Partnership Units in
accordance with this _Section 3.3_, Parent will reflect such admission on the
books and records of Parent.

 

(j) _No Dissenters Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(k) _Tax Characterization of Merger and Cash Received_. The Partnership and
Parent each acknowledges and agrees that for federal income Tax purposes (and
applicable state income or franchise tax purposes) the transactions
consummated pursuant to this Agreement will be treated as an "assets over"
partnership merger transaction under Treasury Regulation Sections
1.708-1(c)(1) and 1.708-1(c)(3)(i), whereby both Operating Partnership and the
Partnership will be the terminating partnerships and Parent will be the
resulting partnership. As a result, the transactions consummated pursuant to
this Agreement shall be treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as a
contribution of all of the assets of Operating Partnership and the Partnership
to Parent in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the cash received in lieu
of fractional New Common Units and the assumption of liabilities. To the
maximum extent possible, the Cash Consideration and any cash received in lieu
of fractional New Common Units shall be treated as a reimbursement of pre-
formation capital expenditures described in Treasury Regulation Section
1.707-4(d). To the extent the Cash Consideration and the cash received in lieu
of fractional New Common Units exceeds the amount that can be so treated,
such excess cash will be treated as proceeds of a disguised sale transaction
described in Section 707(a)(2)(B) of the Code (a " _Disguised Sale_ "). Each
holder of Partnership Class E Preferred Units will be deemed to have

 



21  consented for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and to the extent
applicable, state or local income tax purposes) to report any cash received in
the Class E Preferred Unit Redemption pursuant to Section 7.14(b) as proceeds
from the sale of the holders of Partnership Class E Preferred Units to Parent
consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.708-1(c)(4). Each of the
Partnership and Parent agrees to prepare and file (and cause their respective
Subsidiaries to prepare and file) all U.S. federal income Tax Returns in
accordance with the foregoing and shall not take any position inconsistent
therewith on any such Tax Return, or in the course of any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to U.S. federal income Taxes, except as
otherwise required by applicable Laws following a final determination by a
court of competent jurisdiction or other final administrative decision by an
applicable Governmental Authority.

3.4 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. Without limiting the covenants in _Sections
4.1_ and _4.2_ , in the event the outstanding Partnership Units or Parent
Units shall have been changed into a different number of units or shares or a
different class after the date of this Agreement by reason of any
subdivisions, reclassifications, splits, unit or share distributions,
combinations or exchanges of Partnership Units or Parent Units, the Exchange
Ratio will be correspondingly adjusted to provide to the holders of such
Partnership Units the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event.

3.5 _Treatment of Partnership Phantom Units_.

 

(a) _Cancellation and Settlement of SpinCo Employee Partnership Phantom
Units_. Each phantom Partnership Unit granted under the Partnership Equity
Plans (each, a " _Partnership Phantom Unit_ " and, such plans, the "
_Partnership Equity Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a SpinCo Employee, a non-
employee director of ATLS or the Partnership or a former employee shall, as of
the Effective Time, become fully vested and be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each Partnership
Unit underlying such Partnership Phantom Unit. The holders of Partnership
Phantom Units shall receive the payments described in the immediately
preceding sentence (together with any dividend equivalents corresponding
to Partnership Phantom Units that vest in accordance with this _Section
3.5_), less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the
Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the
making of such payments, within five (5) Business Days following the
Effective Time.

(b) _Partial Rollover of Midstream Business Employee Partnership Phantom
Units_. Each Partnership Phantom Unit, whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a Midstream
Business Employee shall, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive: (i) the Cash Consideration in respect of each
Partnership Unit underlying such Partnership Phantom Unit and (ii) a phantom
unit award corresponding to Parent Units (a " _Parent Phantom Unit_ ") with
respect to a number of Parent Units (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal
to the product of (A) the number of Partnership Units underlying such
Partnership Phantom Unit, _multiplied by_ (B) the Exchange Ratio. The holders
of Partnership Phantom Units shall receive the payments described in the
immediately preceding sentence (together with any dividend equivalents
corresponding to Partnership Phantom Units that vest in accordance with this 
_Section 3.5_), less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign

 



22  Tax Law with respect to the making of such payments, within five (5)
Business Days following the Effective Time. Except as otherwise provided in
this _Section 3.5_, each such Parent Phantom Unit assumed and converted
pursuant to this _Section 3.5_ shall continue to have, and shall be subject
to, the same material terms and conditions and the same vesting conditions as
applied to the corresponding Partnership Phantom Unit immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and shall settle in Parent Units upon vesting.

(c) _Certain Tax Considerations_. The actions contemplated by this _Section
3.5_ shall be taken in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. The aggregate
amount required to be withheld from any holder of Partnership Phantom Units in
connection with the payments described in Sections _3.5(a)_ and _(b)_ shall
first be applied to reduce the portion of such payments payable in the form of
Parent Units and, to the extent such withholding amount exceeds the portion of
such payments payable in the form of Parent Units, such excess shall be
applied to reduce the portion of such payments payable in cash.

(d)  _Termination of Partnership Equity Plans; Issuance of Parent Phantom
Units_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all actions necessary
to terminate each of the Partnership Equity Plans, effective as of and subject
to the occurrence of the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, Parent issue
the Parent Phantom Units in accordance with _Section 3.5(b)_.

(e)  _Parent Actions_. Parent shall take all limited partnership action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Parent Units for
delivery with respect to the settlement of Partnership Phantom Units
contemplated by  _Section 3.5(a)_. Parent shall include in the Registration
Statement a number of Parent Units sufficient to satisfy the settlement of
Partnership Phantom Units contemplated by _Section 3.5(b)_. Parent shall take
all limited partnership action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient
number of Parent Units for delivery upon exercise or settlement of the
Partnership Phantom Units assumed by it in accordance with _Section 3.5(b)_.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, if and to the
extent necessary to cause a sufficient number of Parent Units to be registered
and issuable with respect to Parent Phantom Units, Parent shall file a post-
effective amendment to the Registration Statement or registration statement
on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the
Parent Units subject to Parent Phantom Units and shall use its reasonable
commercial efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Parent
Phantom Units remain outstanding. Not later than immediately following the
Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of a Partnership Phantom
Unit assumed by Parent an appropriate notice setting forth such holders
rights pursuant to the corresponding Parent Phantom Unit.

 

(f) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take any actions reasonably necessary to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this _Section 3.5_, including,
without limitation, having the applicable board or committee administering the
plans governing the affected awards adopt resolutions necessary to effect
the foregoing.

Material Adverse Effect on the Partnership (a " _Partnership Material Adverse
Effect_ ")), the Partnership represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub

limited partnership validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
the State of Delaware. The Partnership has all requisite power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted, except as would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Partnership Material Adverse

business or the ownership, leasing, holding or operating of its properties
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except in each case of
_clauses (i)_ through _(iii)_ , as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. The
Partnership has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the
Partnership Certificate of Limited Partnership, the Existing Partnership
Agreement, the Partnership GP Agreement, the Partnership GP Certificate of
Formation (the " _Partnership Organizational Documents_ "), and the
certificates of formation and limited liability company agreements (or

Subsidiaries (the " _Partnership Subsidiary Documents_ "), in each case as
amended to the date of this Agreement. All such Partnership Organizational
Documents and Partnership Subsidiary Documents are in full force and effect
and the Partnership and its significant Subsidiaries are not in violation of
any of their provisions in any material respect.

Units issuable pursuant to Partnership Phantom Units, when issued in
accordance with the respective terms thereof, will be, duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (except as such nonassessability
may be affected by matters described in Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of
the DRULPA) and free of preemptive rights (except as set forth in the
Partnership Agreement).

interests, or any commitment to authorize, issue or sell the same or any such
equity securities, except pursuant to this Agreement, and (C) there are no
contractual obligations of the Partnership or any of its
respective Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
partnership interest or other equity interest in the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries or any such securities or agreements listed in _clause (B)_ of
this sentence.

 

(d) Neither the Partnership nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding bonds,

in its Subsidiaries as set forth in _Schedule 5.1_ of the Partnership
Disclosure Schedule and, as reflected in _Section 5.3_ of the
Partnership Disclosure Schedule, the Partnership does not own beneficially,
directly or indirectly, any equity securities or similar interests of any

requisite limited partnership power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement and, subject to the Partnership
Unitholder Approval, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
Subject to the Partnership Unitholder Approval, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby have been authorized by all necessary limited
partnership action by the Partnership. The Conflicts Committee has (a)

insolvency, reorganization or other similar Law affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally or by general equitable principles).

state securities Laws and with the NYSE, assuming the other consents and
approvals contemplated by _Section 5.6_ and _Article VIII_ are duly obtained
and assuming the consents, waivers and approvals specified in  _Section
7.9(a)_ are obtained, the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by the
Partnership do not and will not (i) constitute a breach or violation of,
or result in a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would become a default) under, or result in the termination or in a
right of termination or cancellation of, or accelerate the performance
required by, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
franchise, lease, contract, agreement, joint venture or other instrument or
obligation to which the Partnership or any of its respective Subsidiaries is a
party or by which the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries or properties is
subject or bound, (ii) constitute a breach or violation of, or a default under

registrations with, any Governmental Authority are necessary in connection
with (i) the execution and delivery by the Partnership of this Agreement or

filings or registrations the absence or unavailability of which would not,
either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect or materially delay consummation of the
Merger.

 

5.7 _Financial Reports and the Partnership SEC Documents_.

 

(a) Since January 1, 2012, the Partnership has filed or furnished with the SEC
all forms, registration statements, reports, schedules and statements
required to be filed or furnished prior to the date hereof under the Exchange
Act or the Securities Act. At the time filed (or, in the case of registration
statements, solely on the dates of effectiveness) (except to the extent
amended by a subsequently filed Partnership SEC Document prior to the date of
this Agreement, in which case as of the date of such amendment), each
Partnership SEC Document complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, as the case may be and, did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact, or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) Any consolidated financial statements of the Partnership included in the
Partnership SEC Documents (the " _Partnership Financial Statements_ ") as of
their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment)

requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, (ii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be expressly

(c) Neither the Partnership nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has
any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet

transaction or relationship between or among the Partnership and any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the purpose of such contract is
to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Partnership in the Partnerships published financial
statements or any Partnership SEC Documents

 

5.8 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Partnership has established and
maintains internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls
and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under
the Exchange Act); such 

 



33  disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. The
Partnerships principal executive officer and its principal financial officer
have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation of internal control
over financial reporting, to the Partnerships auditors and the audit
committee of the Partnership Board (x) all significant deficiencies in the
design or operation of internal controls that are reasonably likely
to adversely affect the Partnerships ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial data and have identified for the Partnerships auditors
any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Partnerships internal controls. The principal
executive officer and the principal financial officer of the Partnership have
made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act
and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to
the Partnership SEC Documents, and the statements contained in
such certifications were complete and correct as of the dates they were made.

financial statements (or notes thereto) included in the Partnerships Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, the unaudited
financial statements (or notes thereto) included in the Partnerships
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2014 (the
" _Balance Sheet Date_ "), or in the financial statements (or notes thereto)
included in subsequent Partnership SEC Documents filed by the Partnership
prior to the date of this Agreement, neither the Partnership nor any of its
consolidated Subsidiaries had at the Balance Sheet Date or has incurred since
that date, any liabilities that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a

Agreement, or reflected in the notes thereto, (B) incurred since the Balance
Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business, (C) incurred in
accordance with this Agreement or in connection with transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, (D) that would not reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Partnership
Material Adverse Effect or (E) that have been discharged or paid in full.

5.10 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any change, event,
development, circumstance, occurrence or effect that has had or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

for this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) the
Partnership has carried on and operated its businesses in all material
respects in the ordinary course of business and (ii) none of the Partnership
nor any Subsidiary of the Partnership has undertaken any action that would be
prohibited by _Section 4.1(j)_ if such provision were in effect at all times
since the Balance Sheet Date.

not in default under or in violation of any, applicable Law, other than any
noncompliance, default or violation which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse
Effect. The Partnership has not received any written communication since the
Balance Sheet Date and prior to the date of this Agreement from
a Governmental Authority that alleges that the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries is not in compliance with or is in default or violation of any
applicable Law, except where such non-compliance, default or violation would
not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Except for the Environmental Permits (which are provided for in _Section
5.13_), the Partnership and each of its Subsidiaries is in possession of all
franchises, tariffs, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements,

Governmental Authority necessary under applicable Law to own, lease and
operate their properties and to lawfully carry on their businesses as they are
being conducted as of the date of this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Partnership Permits_ "), except where the failure to be in possession of such
Partnership Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. All Partnership
Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full
force and effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or
cancellation of any of the Partnership Permits is pending or threatened,
except where such suspension or cancellation would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse
Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of the
Partnership, no event or condition has occurred or exists which would result
in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a benefit under, or acceleration
of an obligation of the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries under, any
Partnership Permit, or has caused (or would cause) an applicable Governmental
Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew, extend, any Partnership Permit
(in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or both), except for
violations, breaches, defaults, losses, accelerations or failures that would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

and contracts or agreements that will be assumed by the Spin-Off Companies or
their Subsidiaries or for which SpinCo has agreed to indemnify the
Partnership, in each case, pursuant to the Separation Agreement).

 



36 (c) Except to the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity, and _provided_ that any indemnity, contribution
and exoneration provisions contained in any such Partnership Material

obligation of the Partnership and, to the Knowledge of the Partnership,
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the other parties thereto and
(ii) is in full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement, in each
case unless the failure to be so would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse
Effect.

event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default
on the part of any of the parties thereto, or any notice of termination,
cancellation or material modification, in each case, except such events of
default, other events, notices or modifications as to which requisite waivers

 __Except as set forth in (a) all forms, registration statements, reports,

or the Securities Act since January 1, 2012 and on or prior to the date of
this Agreement, and in each case excluding all exhibits and schedules thereto
and documents incorporated by reference therein (collectively, the " _Parent
SEC Documents_ ") (but excluding any disclosure contained in any such Parent
SEC Documents under the heading "Risk Factors" or "Cautionary Note Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements" or similar heading (other than any historical
factual information contained within such headings, disclosure or statements))
or (b) the Parent Disclosure Schedule prior to the execution of this Agreement
( __ _provided_ __that (i) disclosure in any section of such Parent
Disclosure Schedule is deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other
section of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the
face of the Parent Disclosure Schedule that such disclosure is applicable to
such other section notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross
reference thereto and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in such Parent
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty is not
deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or material
fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent (a " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ ")), Parent and Merger Sub
represent and warrant to the Partnership and Partnership GP as follows: __

 

6.1 _Organization, General Authority and Standing_. Parent is a limited
partnership validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware, and Merger Sub is a limited liability company validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Parent GP is a
limited liability company validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the State of Delaware. Each of Parent, Parent GP and Merger Sub

do business and in good standing to do business as a foreign limited

such licensing or qualification necessary, except in each case of _clauses
(ii)_ through _(iii)_ as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has
made available to

 



45  the Partnership true and correct copies of the Parent Certificate of Limited

as set forth in the Parent Agreement).

 

(b) As of October 10, 2014, except as set forth above in this _Section 6.2_
and as set forth in Parents equity plans or grant documents issued

Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any partnership or other equity
interest of Parent or such Subsidiary or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable for such partnership interests or equity interests, or any
commitment to authorize, issue or sell the same or any such equity securities,
except pursuant to this Agreement, and (C) there are no contractual
obligations of Parent or any of its respective Subsidiaries to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any partnership interest or other equity interest
in Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any such securities or agreements
listed in _clause (B)_ of this sentence.

 

(c) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding bonds,

matter.

 

(d) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting or

in its Subsidiaries set forth on _Section 6.1_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, and as reflected in _Section 6.3_ of the Parent Disclosure

reorganization or other similar Law affecting the enforcement of creditors
rights generally or by general equitable principles).

 

6.5 _No Violations or Defaults_. Subject to required filings under federal and
state securities Laws and with the NYSE, assuming the other consents and
approvals contemplated by _Section 6.6_ and _Article VIII_ are duly obtained
and assuming the consents, waivers and approvals specified in _Section
7.9(a)_ are obtained, the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by
Parent do not and will not (i) constitute a breach or violation of, or result
in a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
become a default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of
termination or cancellation of, or accelerate the performance required by, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise, lease,

accelerations, contraventions, conflicts or Liens which, either individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

registrations with, any Governmental Authority are necessary in connection
with (i) the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement
or (ii) the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions

delay consummation of the Merger.

6.7 _Financial Reports and Parent SEC Documents_.

 

(a) Since January 1, 2012, Parent has filed and furnished with the SEC all
forms, registration statements, reports, schedules and statements required to
be filed or furnished prior to the date hereof under the Exchange Act or the

which case as of the date of such amendment), each Parent SEC Document
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may
be, and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

reasonably practicable, and (iii) take, or cause to be taken (including by
their respective Subsidiaries), all other actions consistent with this
_Section 7.1_ necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable (and in
any event no later than the Outside Date).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each
of the Parent Entities, TRGP and the Partnership agrees to take, and to cause
its respective Subsidiaries to take, any and all steps and to make, and cause
to be made, any and all

 



58  undertakings necessary to resolve such objections, if any, that a
Governmental Authority may assert under any Antitrust Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Transactions), and
to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under the Antitrust Laws that
may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to such
transactions so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable,
and in any event no later than the Outside Date, including (x) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any
businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of any
Party or any of its Subsidiaries, (y) creating, terminating, or divesting
relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of any Party or its
Subsidiaries and (z) otherwise taking or committing to take any action that
after the Closing would limit Parent or its Subsidiaries TRGP or its
Subsidiaries or the Partnership or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, freedom
of action with respect to, or their ability to retain or hold, one or more of
their or their Subsidiaries (including ATLS, the Partnerships or their
Subsidiaries) businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or
properties, in each case as may be required in order to obtain all approvals,
consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting periods,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations or to avoid the
commencement of any action to prohibit the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or, in the alternative, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any action or proceeding seeking to prohibit the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or delay the Closing beyond the Outside Date (each, a "
_Divestiture Action_ "); _provided_ that none of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
TRGP and its Subsidiaries or the Partnership and its Subsidiaries shall be
required to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any
condition or limitation, in connection with the foregoing that would
reasonably be expected to (i) in the case of assets, properties or business
of Parent or its Subsidiaries, materially and adversely impact the business
or operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries (as measured prior to the
Effective Time) within any specific oil and natural gas producing basin or in
any distinctive market area if outside of an oil and natural gas producing
basin or (ii) in the case of assets, properties or business of the Partnership
or its Subsidiaries, materially and adversely impact the business or
operations of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries (as measured prior to the
Effective Time) within any specific oil and natural gas producing basin or in
any distinctive market area if outside of an oil and natural gas producing
basin; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the consummation of the transactions
provided for in any such agreement for a Divestiture Action shall be
conditioned upon the Closing or satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions to Closing in a case where the Closing will occur
immediately following such Divestiture Action.

(d) Each of the Parties hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry
by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Merger, including any
proceeding initiated by a private Person, (ii) promptly inform the Other
Parties of (and supply to the Other Parties) any communication received by
such Party from, or given by such Party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental
Authority and any material communication received or given in connection with
any proceeding by a private Person, in each case regarding the Merger, (iii)
permit the Other Parties to review in advance and incorporate the Other
Parties reasonable comments in any communication to be given by it to any

 



59  Governmental Authority with respect to obtaining any clearances required
under any Antitrust Law in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and (iv) consult with the Other Parties in advance of any meeting or
teleconference with any Governmental Authority or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private Person, with any other Person, and, to the extent not
prohibited by the Governmental Authority or other Person, give the Other
Parties the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
teleconferences. Subject to _Section 7.4(b)_, the Parties will take
reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege
or any other privilege pursuant to this _Section 7.1_ in a manner so as to
preserve the applicable privilege. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, TRGP shall, on behalf of the Parties, control
and lead all communications and strategy relating to the Antitrust Laws,
subject to the good faith consultations with ATLS and the Partnership and the
inclusion of ATLS and the Partnership at meetings with any Governmental
Authority with respect to any discussion related to the Merger under the
Antitrust Laws.

 

7.2 _Registration Statement; Partnership Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Partnership will prepare the Partnership Proxy Statement and the Parent will
prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement (which shall include
the Partnership Proxy Statement). Each of the Partnership and Parent will use
its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such
filing and keep the Registration Statement effective for so long as necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The Partnership will use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Partnership Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the Partnership Unitholders as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent
shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state or
provincial securities law in connection with the issuance and reservation of
the New Common Units, and the Partnership shall furnish all information
concerning the Partnership and the holders of Partnership Units or a
beneficial interest therein as may be reasonably requested in connection with
any such action. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration
Statement will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement
to, the Partnership Proxy Statement will be made by the Partnership without
providing the Other Parties a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon; _provided_ , that the Partnership, in connection with a Partnership
Change in Recommendation, may amend or supplement the Registration Statement
and the Joint Proxy Statement to effect such change if, and to the extent,
such amendment or supplement is required by applicable Law. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Partnership or
Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, is
discovered by the Partnership or Parent that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to either the Registration Statement or the
Partnership Proxy Statement, so that any such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information will
promptly notify the Other Parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information will be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to the Partnership Unitholders. The
Parties will notify each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or the staff of the

 



60  SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Partnership Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement
or for additional information and will supply each other with copies of (i)
all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the
Partnership Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating to the
Registration Statement.

(b) Subject to _Section 7.2(c)_ and the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article IX_ , the Partnership will, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Registration Statement being declared effective by
the SEC, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold, the Partnership Meeting. Except as permitted by _Section 7.3_, the
Partnership Proxy Statement shall include the Partnership Boards
recommendation that the Partnership Unitholders approve this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (the " _Partnership
Board Recommendation_ "). Subject to the termination of this Agreement, the
Partnerships obligations to call, give notice of and hold the Partnership
Meeting in accordance with _Section 7.2_ shall not be limited by the making,
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Superior Proposal
or Alternative Proposal, or by any Partnership Change in Recommendation.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Partnership agrees that:
(i) unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Article
IX_ (including, if applicable, upon payment of the Termination Fee and the
Expenses), the Partnership shall not submit any Superior Proposal to a vote of
the Partnership Unitholders; and (ii) it shall not (without Parents prior
written consent) adjourn, postpone or cancel (or propose, publicly or
otherwise, or resolve to, to adjourn, postpone or cancel) the Partnership
Meeting, except (i) in the absence of proxies sufficient to obtain the
Partnership Unitholder Approval, to solicit additional proxies for
the purpose of obtaining Partnership Unitholder Approval, (ii) in the absence
of a quorum, or (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing
and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Partnership
has determined after consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary
under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Partnership Unitholders prior to Partnership
Meeting, such additional time not to exceed ten (10) calendar days.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if there occurs a
Partnership Change in Recommendation, the Partnership shall remain required to
call, hold and convene the Partnership Meeting unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms.

(c) The Partnership will use its reasonable best efforts to hold
the Partnership Meeting on the same day as the ATLS unitholders meeting and
TRGP stockholders meeting to be held pursuant to the ATLS Merger Agreement on
the same day at the same time as soon as reasonably practicable after the date
of this Agreement, and to set the same record date as such meetings.

7.3 _Alternative Proposals; Change in Recommendation by the Partnership_.

(a) Each of Partnership GP and the Partnership will and will cause the
Partnerships Subsidiaries to, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause
its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Person (other
than the Parent Entities and their respective Representatives) conducted on
or prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any

 



61  Alternative Proposal (which, for this purpose, need not have been an
unsolicited proposal) and shall request of each such Person that executed a
confidentiality agreement with the Partnership with respect to any
Alternative Proposal (which, for this purpose, need not have been an
unsolicited proposal) in the six (6) months prior to the date hereof and is in
possession of confidential information about Partnership GP, the
Partnership or any of their Subsidiaries the return or destruction of all
such confidential information in accordance with the terms of the
confidentiality agreement with such Person. From and after the execution of
this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ , neither Partnership GP nor the
Partnership will, and each of the Partnership and the Partnership will cause
their respective Subsidiaries, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause
its and their respective officers, directors, managers, members, employees and
other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information), facilitate
the making, submission or announcement of any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, any Alternative
Proposal, or (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public information
regarding Partnership GP, the Partnership or their Subsidiaries with respect
to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, or in connection with or
for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any Alternative Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 7.3_,
if at any time following the execution of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval, (i) the Partnership has
received an unsolicited written Alternative Proposal that the Partnership
Board (upon the recommendation of the Conflicts Committee) believes is _bona
fide_ , and that did not result from a breach of this _Section 7.3_, and (ii)
the Partnership Board (upon the recommendation of the Conflicts Committee),
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
determines in good faith that such Alternative Proposal could reasonably
result in a Superior Proposal, then the Partnership may, subject to _clauses
(x)_ and _(y)_ below, (A) furnish information, including non-public
information, with respect to the Partnership and its Subsidiaries to, and
afford access to the business, properties, books and records of the
Partnership and its Subsidiaries, to the Person making such Alternative
Proposal and such Persons Representatives and (B) enter into and participate
in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Alternative
Proposal and its Representatives; provided that (x) (I) promptly following
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) of the Partnership first
furnishing any such non-public information to, or first entering into
discussions or negotiations with, such Person, the Partnership shall give
Parent written notice of such action, including the identity of such Person,
and (II) prior to furnishing any such non-public information, the Partnership
shall have received from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement with confidentiality provisions no less favorable to the
Partnership than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement as in effect
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, a copy of which shall be
provided to Parent promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
following execution and (y) the Partnership will promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) provide to Parent any non-public information about
the Partnership and its Subsidiaries that was not previously provided or made
available to Parent following the provision of any such non-public information
to such other Person.

 

(c) In addition to the other obligations of the Partnership set forth in this
_Section 7.3_, the Partnership will promptly (and in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours after

 



62  receipt) (i) advise Parent in writing of any Alternative Proposal (and any
changes thereto) that it receives and the material terms and conditions of any
such Alternative Proposal, including the identity of such Person making such
Alternative Proposal, and (ii) if in writing, provide Parent a copy of any
such Alternative Proposal. The Partnership will keep Parent reasonably
informed of the status and material terms and conditions of such Alternative
Proposal and any material modification thereto, including if in writing,
providing Parent with a copy thereof. The Partnership Entities agree that
neither the Partnership nor any of its Subsidiaries will enter into any
agreement with any Person which prohibits the Partnership from providing any
information to Parent in accordance with this _Section 7.3_.

 

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.3_, neither the
Partnership Board nor the Conflicts Committee shall (i): (A) change,
withdraw, withhold, modify or qualify, or publicly propose to withdraw, modify
or qualify, in each case, in any manner adverse to Parent, the Partnership
Board Recommendation, (B) fail to include the Partnership
Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, (C) fail to reaffirm
(publicly, if so requested by Parent) the Partnership Board Recommendation
within five (5) Business Days after the date of any Alternative Proposal (or
material modification thereto) is publicly disclosed by the Partnership or
the Person making such Alternative Proposal (except for a tender or exchange
offer, which shall be governed by clause (D)), (D) fail to announce publicly
within the ten (10) Business Days period (as specified in Rule 14e-2 under
the Exchange Act) after a tender offer or exchange offer relating to the
Partnership Units shall have been commenced that the Partnership Board (upon
the recommendation of the Conflicts Committee) recommends rejection of such
tender offer or exchange offer and reaffirming the Partnership Board
Recommendation; or (E) publicly approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve, recommend or enter into, any Alternative Proposal (any action
described in this _Section 7.3(d)_ being referred to as a " _Partnership
Change in Recommendation_ "); or (ii) approve, adopt or allow Partnership GP,
the Partnership or any of their Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, or other similar contract or any tender or
exchange offer providing for, with respect to, or in connection with,
any Alternative Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, a public statement that
describes the Partnerships receipt of an Alternative Proposal and the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed a
Partnership Change in Recommendation.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if (i) the
Partnership receives a written, unsolicited Alternative Proposal (and such
proposal is not withdrawn) that the Partnership Board (upon the recommendation
of the Conflicts Committee) believes is _bona fide_ , (ii) such Alternative
Proposal did not result, directly or indirectly, from a breach of this
_Section 7.3_, and (iii) the Partnership Board (upon the recommendation of
the Conflicts Committee) determines, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Alternative Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Partnership Board (upon the
recommendation of the Conflicts Committee) may at any time prior to obtaining
the Partnership Unitholder Approval, effect a Partnership Change
in Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership Board may
not take such action pursuant to the foregoing unless:

 

(i) the Partnership has provided prior written notice to Parent specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons for such action (including a description of the
material

 



63  terms of such Superior Proposal and delivering to Parent a copy of the
proposed definitive agreement providing for the Alternative Proposal for such
Superior Proposal in the form to be entered into and any other relevant
proposed transaction agreements, at least seventy-two (72) hours in advance of
its intention to effect a Partnership Change in Recommendation, unless at the
time such notice is otherwise required to be given there are less than
seventy-two (72) hours prior to the Partnership Meeting, in which case the
Partnership will provide as much notice as is reasonably practicable (the
period inclusive of all such hours, the " _Notice Period_ ") (it being
understood and agreed that any material amendment to the terms of a Superior
Proposal shall require a new notice pursuant to this _Section 7.3(e)(i)_ and
a new Notice Period, except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to forty-
eight (48) hours (or if there are less than forty-eight (48) hours prior to
the Partnership Meeting, as much notice as is reasonably practicable)); and

 

(ii) during the Notice Period the Partnership has negotiated with Parent in
good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal.

 

(f) The Partnership Board (upon the recommendation of the Conflicts Committee)
is permitted, at any time prior to obtaining the Partnership Unitholder
Approval, other than in connection with an Alternative Proposal, to make a
Partnership Change in Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event but
only if (i) prior to taking any such action, the Partnership Board (upon
the recommendation of the Conflicts Committee) determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Partnerships outside legal counsel, that failure
to take such action would result in a breach of its duties under applicable
Law, the Existing Partnership Agreement or the Partnership GP Agreement, (ii)
the Partnership has given at least seventy-two (72) hours advance written
notice to Parent that the Partnership Board (upon the recommendation of the
Conflicts Committee) intends to take such action (which notice shall specify
in reasonable detail the reasons for such action) and (iii) during such period
the Partnership has negotiated with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so as to permit the Partnership Board (upon the recommendation
of the Conflicts Committee) not to make a Partnership Change in
Recommendation. An " _Intervening Event_ " means a material event,
circumstance, state of facts, occurrence, development or change that did not
exist or was not known to the Conflicts Committee on the date of this
Agreement (or if known, the consequences of which were not known by the
Conflicts Committee as of the date of this Agreement), which event,
circumstance, state of facts, occurrence, development or change, or any
material consequences thereof, (i) becomes known to the Conflicts Committee
prior to the receipt of the Partnership Unitholder Approval and (ii) does not
relate to an Alternative Proposal; _provided, however_ , that (x) no event,
circumstance, state of facts, occurrence, development or change arising from
any action or omission by Partnership GP, the Partnership or any of their
Subsidiaries that is required to be taken or omitted by this Agreement,
including any action taken or omission made with respect to the obtaining of
the necessary consents and approvals pursuant to Sections 7.1 and 7.9 may
give rise to an Intervening Event and (y) if the Intervening Event relates to
an event, circumstance, state of facts, occurrence, development or change
involving Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, then such event, circumstance,
state of facts, occurrence, development or change shall not constitute an
Intervening Event unless it has a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



64 (g) Nothing contained in this Agreement will prevent the Partnership or the
Partnership Board from taking and disclosing to the Partnership Unitholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Partnership Unitholders) or
from making any legally required disclosure to Partnership Unitholders;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership Board shall not make a
Partnership Change in Recommendation except in accordance with Section 7.3(e)
or 7.3(f). Any "stop-look-and-listen" communication by the Partnership or the
Partnership Board to the Partnership Unitholders pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
the Partnership Unitholders) will not be considered a Partnership Change in
Recommendation.

 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any unsolicited proposal or offer from
any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act),
other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (A) direct or indirect
acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions, and whether through a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation, unit exchange, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction), of assets of
the Partnership and its Subsidiaries equal to 20% or more of the
combined assets of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries or to which 20% or
more of the combined revenues or earnings of the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries are attributable or (B) direct or indirect acquisition (whether
in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, and whether
through a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, unit exchange,
share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or other transaction) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning
of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of the equity securities
of the Partnership GP or securities of the Partnership representing 20% or
more of the voting power of the securities of the Partnership.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited written offer to acquire,
directly or indirectly, (a) 75% or more of the outstanding equity securities
of the Partnership representing 75% or more of the voting power of the
securities of the Partnership or (b) 75% or more of the combined assets of the
Partnership and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and on terms and
conditions which the Partnership Board (upon the recommendation of the
Conflicts Committee) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, to be more favorable from a
financial point of view to the Partnership Unitholders than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account at the time of
determination such matters the Partnership Board (upon the recommendation of
the Conflicts Committee) deems relevant, including the legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of such offer (including conditions to and
expected timing and risks of consummation and the ability of the party making
such proposal to obtain financing for such Acquisition Proposal,
if applicable) and any changes to the terms of this Agreement that as of that
time had been committed to by Parent in writing.

7.4  _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, each Party shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to afford to the Other Parties and
their respective

 



65  Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours (and, with
respect to the books and records, the right to copy) to all of its and its
Subsidiaries properties, commitments, books, contracts, records and
correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form),
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives throughout the period prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article
IX_. Each Party shall furnish promptly to the Other Parties (i) a copy of each
report, schedule and other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any
communication (including "comment letters") received by such Party from the
SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws and (ii) all other information
concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as
the Other Parties may reasonably request, including information necessary to
prepare the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement. Except for
disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, each
Party and its Representatives shall hold information received from the Other
Parties pursuant to this _Section 7.4(a)_ in confidence in accordance with
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) This _Section 7.4(b)_ shall not require any Party to permit any access,
or to disclose any information, if such access or disclosure would
unreasonably disrupt the operations of such Party and its Subsidiaries or, in
the reasonable, good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which
may be in-house counsel) of such Party would reasonably be expected to result
in (i) any violation of any contract or Law to which such Party or its
Subsidiaries is a party or would cause a loss of privilege to such Party or
any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) if such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and any Other Party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, are adverse parties in a litigation, such information being reasonably
pertinent thereto; _provided_ that, in the case of  _clause (i)_, the
Parties shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such
information to the extent doing so (1) would not (in the good faith belief of
the Party being requested to disclose the information (after consultation
with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) reasonably be likely to result
in the violation of any such contract or Law or cause a loss of such privilege
or (2) could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the Party being
requested to disclose the information (after consultation with counsel, which
may be in-house counsel)) be managed through the use of customary "clean-room"
arrangements pursuant to which non-employee Representatives of the Other Party
shall be provided access to such information; provided, further, that the
Party being requested to disclose the information shall (x) notify the Other
Parties that such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its
Subsidiaries obligations under any such contract or Law or cause a loss of
such privilege and (y) communicate to the Other Parties in reasonable detail
the facts giving rise to such notification and the subject matter of such
information (to the extent it is able to do so in accordance with the first
proviso in this _Section 7.4(b)_) and (z) in the case where such disclosures
are reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries obligations under
any contract, use reasonable commercial efforts to seek consent from the
applicable third party to any such contract with respect to the disclosures
prohibited thereby (to the extent not otherwise expressly prohibited by the
terms of such contract).

7.5 _Public Statements_. The initial press releases with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall each be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and
the Partnership. Except following any Partnership Change of Recommendation,
Parent and the Partnership will not, and each of the foregoing will cause its
Representatives not to, issue any public announcements or

 



66  make other public disclosures regarding this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, without the prior written approval of the Parties;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a Party or its Representatives may issue a
public announcement or other public disclosures required by Law or the rules
of any stock exchange upon which such Partys or its Parent entitys capital
stock is traded, provided such Party uses reasonable best efforts to afford
the Other Party an opportunity to first review the content of the proposed
disclosure and provide reasonable comment regarding same.

 

7.6 _Confidentiality_. The obligations of Parent and the Partnership under the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms and all information provided to any Party or its
Representatives pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement is deemed to
be "Evaluation Material" as defined under the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in the Confidentiality Agreement shall
be deemed to restrict the performance by the Partnership Entities or the
Parent Entities of their respective obligations under this Agreement, and in
the case of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement the terms of this Agreement shall control.

 

7.7 _Takeover Laws_. Neither the Partnership nor Parent will take any action
that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the ATLS
Merger Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws,
and each of them will take all reasonable steps within its control to exempt
(or ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement from the Takeover Laws of any state that purport to apply to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

7.8 _New Common Units Listed_. Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to
list, prior to the Closing, on the NYSE, upon official notice of issuance,
the New Common Units.

7.9 _Third-Party Approvals_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and the
Partnership and their respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to prepare all documentation, to
effect all filings, to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all Governmental Authorities and third parties necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to comply with
the terms and conditions of such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations and to cause the Merger to be consummated as expeditiously as
practicable. Each of Parent and the Partnership has the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other, in
each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
with respect to, all material written information submitted to any third
party or any Governmental Authorities in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the
Parties agrees to act reasonably and promptly. Each Party agrees that it will
consult with the Other Parties with respect to the obtaining of all material
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party will keep the Other Parties
apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



67 (b) Each of Parent and the Partnership agrees, upon request, to furnish the
Other Party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries,
directors, officers and unitholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Partnership Proxy
Statement, the Registration Statement or any filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of such Other Party or any of such Other Partys
Subsidiaries to any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(c) This _Section 7.9_ shall not apply to (i) approval under Antitrust Laws

7.10 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or
indemnification agreement or under the Existing Partnership Agreement, this
Agreement or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of
any of the Partnerships Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity, jointly and severally, will: (i)
indemnify and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been or becomes at
any time prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of
Partnership GP, the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries and also with
respect to any such Person, in such Persons capacity as a director, officer,
employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, foundation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise (whether or not such other entity or enterprise is affiliated with
the Partnership) serving at the request of or on behalf of Partnership GP, the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries and together with such Persons heirs,
executors or administrators (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to
the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law in connection
with any Claim or Action against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, Indemnification Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid
in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) resulting therefrom;
and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within 15 days after any request for
advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, any Indemnification
Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or
otherwise participating with respect to any Claim or Action in advance of the
final disposition of such Claim or Action, including payment on behalf of or
advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Indemnification Expenses incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with
respect to such indemnification or advancement, in each case without the
requirement of any bond or other security. The indemnification and advancement
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity pursuant to this _Section
7.10(a)_ extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time
and any Claim or Action relating thereto (including with respect to any acts
or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the ATLS Merger Agreement, including the consideration and
approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any
Claim or Action relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and
advancement conferred hereunder continue as to any Indemnified Party who has
ceased to be a director or officer of the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement and inure to the benefit of
such Persons heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. As used
in this _Section 7.10_: (x) the term " _Claim_ " means any threatened,
asserted, pending or completed action or proceeding,

 



68  whether instituted by any Party, any Governmental Authority or any other
Person, that any Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to the
institution of any action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or other
alternative dispute resolution mechanism (" _Action_ "), arising out of or
pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified Partys duties or
service as a director or officer of Partnership GP or of any of the
Partnerships Subsidiaries or as a trustee of (or in a similar capacity with)
any compensation and benefit plan of any thereof; (y) the term "
_Indemnification Expenses_ " means documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees
and expenses and all other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs,
expenses and obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses, court
costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as
well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness
in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is sought pursuant
to this _Section 7.10(a)_, including any Action relating to a claim for
indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party; and (z) the
phrase "to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law"
includes, but is not limited to (1) to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by any provision of the DRULPA and the DLLCA that authorizes or
permits additional indemnification by agreement or otherwise, or the
corresponding provision of any amendment to or replacement of the DRULPA and
the DLLCA and (2) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any
amendments to or replacements of the DRULPA and the DLLCA adopted after the
date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which an entity may
indemnify its directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents,
or fiduciaries or Persons serving in any capacity in which any Indemnified
Party serves. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of the DRULPA or the DLLCA
that adversely affects any right of any Indemnified Party will be prospective
only and does not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any Claim
or Action involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or
omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal. Neither
Parent nor the Surviving Entity will settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened Claim or Action in respect
of which indemnification has been or could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Claim or Action without admission or finding of wrongdoing, or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the Indemnitees as provided in the Existing
Partnership Agreement (or, as applicable, the charter, bylaws, partnership
agreement, limited liability company agreement, or other organizational
documents of any of Partnership GP or the Partnerships Subsidiaries) and
indemnification agreements (including, without limitation, the Director and
Officer Indemnification Agreements) of Partnership GP, the Partnership or any
of its Subsidiaries will be assumed by the Surviving Entity and Parent in the
Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and will survive the
Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent will maintain in
effect the current directors and officers liability and fiduciary liability
insurance policies covering the Indemnified Parties (but may substitute
therefor other policies of at least the same

 



69  coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous to the Indemnified Parties so long as that substitution does not
result in gaps or lapses in coverage or are alleged to have occurred) with
respect to matters occurring on or before the Effective Time, but Parent is
not required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual
premiums paid therefor prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum
Amount_ ") and will purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be
obtained for that amount if the coverage described in this _Section 7.10(c)_
would cost in excess of that amount. If the Partnership elects, then it may,
on or prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail policy" with respect to
acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective
Time that were committed or alleged to have been committed by such
Indemnified Parties in their capacity as such; _provided_ that in no event
shall the cost of such policy, if purchased by the Partnership, exceed six
times the Maximum Amount and, if such a "tail policy" is purchased,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall have any further obligations
under this _Section 7.10(c)_.

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and is
not the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 7.10_.

(e) Parent will cause the Surviving Entity to perform all of the obligations
of the Surviving Entity under this _Section 7.10_.

(f) This _Section 7.10_ survives the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and to be enforceable by, the Indemnified
Parties and the Indemnitees and their respective heirs and personal
representatives, and will be binding on Parent, the Surviving Entity and their
respective successors and assigns.

7.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Partnership shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Partnership, to
the extent in each case it obtains Knowledge thereof of (i) any notice or
other communication received by such Party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent
would reasonably be expected to be material to the Partnership or Parent,
(ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such Party
or any of its Subsidiaries and that relate to the Merger, (iii) the discovery
of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would result in the failure
to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VIII_ and
(iv) any material failure of such Party to comply with or satisfy any covenant
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereby which would result
in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in
_Article VIII_; _provided_ that, in the case of _clauses (iii)_ and _(iv)_ ,
the failure to comply with this  _Section 7.11_ shall not result in the
failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article
VIII_, or give rise to any right to terminate this Agreement under _Article
IX_, if the underlying fact, circumstance, event or failure would not in and
of itself give rise to such failure or right.

 



70 7.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Partnership will take all such steps as may be required (to the extent
permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Partnership Units
(including derivative securities with respect to Partnership Units) resulting
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who
is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Partnership, or will become subject to such reporting
requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

7.13 _Transaction Litigation_. Other than any Proceeding or Action where
Parent is adverse to the Partnership, the Partnership shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any security holder
litigation against the Partnership, and/or its respective directors relating
to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
no such settlement shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of
Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

__7.14 _APL Preferred Units_ __. (a) If the record date of the Partnership
Meeting (" _Record Date_ ") occurs before the Mandatory Conversion Date (as
defined in Section 2 of the certificate of designations of the Partnership
Class D Preferred Units (the " _Class D Certificate of Designations_ ")), the
Partnership Entities and the Parent Entities shall cooperate and take such
actions as are necessary, required or advisable to cause all Partnership Class
D Preferred Units issued and outstanding as of the Record Date to convert, on
the Record Date, into Partnership Units in accordance with Section 7(b) of the
Class D Certificate of Designations and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof. _ _

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Partnership Entities and the Parent
Entities shall cooperate and take, or cause their Subsidiaries to take, such
actions as are necessary, required or advisable to redeem, effective as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, all Partnership Class E Preferred
Units outstanding as of such time for cash in accordance with Section 5 of
the certificate of designations of such Partnership Class E Preferred Units
and without any action on the part of the holders thereof (the " _Class E
Preferred Unit Redemption_ "); _provided_ , that Parent shall provide to the
Partnership, or deposit with the paying agent for the Class E Preferred Unit
Redemption on behalf of the Partnership, proceeds in an amount sufficient to
fund the Class E Preferred Unit Redemption. Consistent with  _Section
3.3(k)_, the Class E Preferred Unit Redemption shall, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes (and to the extent applicable, state or local income tax
purposes), be treated as the proceeds from the sale of the holders of
Partnership Class E Preferred Units to Parent as described in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.708-1(c)(4).

7.15 _Distributions_. Parent and the Partnership shall coordinate with each
other the declaration of, and the setting of record dates and payment dates
for, distributions in respect of their respective units so that, in respect of
any fiscal quarter, holders of Partnership Units do not (a) receive more than
one distribution in respect of both Partnership Units and Parent Units
received pursuant to the Merger in exchange therefor, or (b) fail to receive a
distribution in respect of one of either Partnership Units or Parent Units
received pursuant to the Merger in exchange therefor.

 



71 7.16 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys rights
or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree that
(a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Partnership,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other partys
operations prior to the Closing and (b) prior to the Closing, each of Parent
and the Partnership shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

 

7.17 _Cash Requirements_. From and after the date of this Agreement, the
Partnership agrees that, unless otherwise approved by Parent in writing, no
cash distributions will be made by the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries
to ATLS or ATLS GP or any other Retained Company or any Spin-Off Company;
provided, that this provision will not restrict cash transfers among
the Partnership and its Subsidiaries or restrict distributions in the
ordinary course to ATLS in respect of its holdings of general partner
interests, limited partner interests and incentive distribution rights in the
Partnership.

under this  _Section 9.1(b)_ is not available to the Partnership, on the one
hand, or Parent, on the other hand, if such order was due, in whole or in

Merger Sub, on the other hand, to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement;

(c) by Parent if the Partnership has breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform if it was continuing as of the

perform is incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, is not
cured by the earlier of (x) the Outside Date or (y) within thirty (30) days
following receipt by the Partnership of written notice of such breach or
failure from Parent; _provided_ that if such breach or failure to perform is
capable of being cured by the Partnership by the Outside Date, such

Partnership is using its reasonable best efforts to cure such breach or
failure to perform;  _provided_ , _further_ that Parent shall not have the

fifty percent (50%) of the Termination Fee  _minus_ any payment in respect of
the Expenses previously paid to the Partnership pursuant to _Section 9.4(f)_.

(h) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Partnership pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_ and TRGP becomes obligated to pay a
"termination fee" under _Section 9.4(e)_ of the ATLS Merger Agreement, Parent
shall, concurrent with the payment of such "termination fee" by TRGP, pay
fifty percent (50%) of the Termination Fee to the Partnership.

 



77 (i) Any payment of the Termination Fee or Expenses (or applicable portion
thereof) will be made in cash by wire transfer of same day funds to an
account designated in writing by the recipient of such payment.

(j) As used herein, (i) " _Termination Fee_ " means a cash amount equal to
$122,900,000, (ii) " _Expenses_ " means a cash amount equal to $40,900,000 to
be paid in respect of the expenses of Parent or the Partnership, as
applicable, incurred in connection with the negotiation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the performance of the transactions
contemplated hereby. In no event will the Partnership or the Parent be
required to (i) make a payment in respect of the Termination Fee to the other
Party on more than one occasion or (ii) make a payment in respect of the
Expenses to the other Party on more than one occasion.

 

(k) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Upon payment of the Termination Fee to Parent (or 50% of the
Termination Fee if that is the amount that is payable and no payment could
be payable under _Section 9.4(a)_), the Partnership and its Subsidiaries
shall not have any further liability with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby to Parent or its stockholders, except in the
case of fraud or willful and material breach. The Parties acknowledge that
neither the Termination Fee (nor a 50% portion thereof) nor the Expenses are a
penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the other Party in the circumstances in which such Termination Fee
(or a 50% portion thereof) or Expenses are payable and which do not involve
fraud or willful and material breach, for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance
on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision.

10.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of
Law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of
the Other Parties, except that (i) Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and (ii) Parent may assign

Agreement to one or more wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent, but no such
assignment shall relieve Parent, or Merger Sub of any of its obligations

shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section
10.6, each Party shall be entitled to assign its rights (but not delegate any
of its obligations) described in _Article IX_ to one or more Affiliates of
such Party, and no such assignment shall relieve such Party of its obligations
under _Article IX_.

 

10.7 _Entire Understanding; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and
the other Transaction Agreements, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties
with respect to the matters therein and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings on such matters. The provisions of this Agreement are
binding upon, inure to the benefit of the Parties and, subject to _Section
10.6_, their respective successors and assigns, and no provision of this
Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or
liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the Parties and their
respective successors and, except (a) as provided in _Section 7.10_ (which
will be to the benefit of and enforceable by the Persons referred to in such
Section), (b) following the Effective Time, the rights of holders of
Partnership Units to receive the Merger Consideration and (c) as provided in
_Section 10.14_ (which will be to the benefit of and enforceable by the
Financing Sources). 

10.8 _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement which is invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions hereof
in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision of this
Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.

10.9 _Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware or, if such Court

 



81  does not have subject matter jurisdiction, to the Superior Court of the
State of Delaware or, if jurisdiction is vested exclusively in the Federal
courts of the United States, the Federal courts of the United States sitting
in the State of Delaware, and any appellate court from any such state or
Federal court, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree that all
claims with respect to any such claim shall be heard and determined in such
Delaware court or in such Federal court, as applicable. The Parties agree that
a final judgment in any such claim is conclusive and may be enforced in any
other jurisdiction by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law.

 

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related matter in any
Delaware state or Federal court located in the State of Delaware and the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such claim in any such
court.

(c) Each of the Parties agrees that it will not, and it will not permit any
of its controlled Affiliates to, bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind of description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against
any Financing Source or any Financing Related Party, in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the financing
or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York or, if such court does not have subject
matter jurisdiction, in any state court located in the Borough of Manhattan
(and the Parties hereto agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and
venue in, such court in connection therewith), and that the provisions of
_Section 10.10_ relating to waiver of jury trial shall apply to such action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim.

10.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW
THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND COVENANTS
THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND,
ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED TO,
BASED ON, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF,
WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT OR
CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE. ANY PARTY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY
OF THIS _SECTION 10.10_ WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF
EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

10.11 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified as Parties
and no past, present or future Affiliate, director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner, stockholder, agent,
attorney or representative of any Party has any liability for any obligations
or liabilities of the Parties or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



82 10.12 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is
accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with
this _Section 10.12_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any state or
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the
basis that (x) any Party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law
or equity. Each Party further agrees that no Party shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 10.12_,
and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 

 __10.13 _Survival_ __. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, none
of the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained in
this Agreement will survive the Closing or the termination of this Agreement
if this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Article IX_ prior
to the Closing; _provided, however_ , that if the Closing occurs, the
covenants and agreements of the Parties which contemplated performance after
the Effective Time or otherwise expressly by their terms survive the Effective
Time will survive the Closing and if this Agreement is terminated prior to
the Closing, the agreements of the Parties in _Sections 7.6_, _9.2_ , _9.3_
and _9.4_ , and this _Article X_ will survive such termination. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall (i) survive termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms and (ii) terminate as of the Effective Time. This
_Section 10.13_ shall not affect the rights and obligations of any party to
the Separation Agreement under such Separation Agreement. _ _

10.14 _No Recourse to Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the Partnership Entities agree, on behalf of themselves and
each of their former, current or future officers, directors, managers,
employees, members, partners, Partnership Unitholders, agents and other
representatives and controlled Affiliates (the " _Partnership Parties_ ")
that Bank of America, N.A., Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated and any other arranger or lender that is or may become party to
the Debt Financing Commitment (as defined in the ATLS Merger Agreement) and
any joinder agreements or credit agreements relating thereto and their
respective Affiliates (collectively " _Financing Sources_ "), and each of
their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, officers, directors, agents, representatives
and Affiliates, and each of their successors and assigns (collectively, "
_Finance Related Parties_ ") shall be subject to no liability or claims to
the Partnership Parties in connection with the financing of or in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (a) no amendment
or modification to _Section 10.7(c)_, _Section 10.9(c)_, _Section 10.10_ or
this  _Section 10.144_ (or amendment or modification with respect to any
related definitions as they affect _Section 10.7(c)_, _Section 10.10_
_Section 10.9(c)_ or this _Section 10.144_) shall be effective without the
prior written consent of each Financing Source (on behalf of themselves and
the applicable Financing Related Parties), (b) no amendment or modification to
_Section 9.4_ (or any  

 



83  amendment or modification with respect to any related definitions as they
affect _Section 9.4_) that would be adverse to the Financing Sources or the
Financing Related Parties shall be effective without the prior written
consent of each Financing Source (on behalf of themselves and the applicable
Financing Related Parties), and (c) each Financing Source and Financing
Related Party shall be an express third party beneficiary of, and shall have
the right to enforce, _Section 9.4_, _Section 10.7(c)_, _Section 10.9(c)_,
_Section 10.10_ or this _Section 10.144_. Each of the Parties hereto agrees
that  _Section 10.4_ notwithstanding, this _Section 10.144_ shall be
interpreted and any action relating to this provision shall be governed by the
laws of the State of New York.

 __This Amendment No. 3 (this " _Amendment No. 3_") to the First Amended and
Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Targa Resources Partners LP (the
" _Partnership_ "), dated as of February 14, 2007, as amended by Amendment No.
1 thereto dated as of May 13, 2008 and Amendment No. 2 thereto dated as
of May 25, 2012 (as so amended, the " _Partnership Agreement_ ") is hereby
adopted effective as of [ ], [ ] by Targa Resources GP LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company (the " _General Partner_ "), as general
partner of the Partnership. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have
the meaning given such terms in the Partnership Agreement. __

WHEREAS, acting pursuant to the power and authority granted to it under
Section 13.1(d) of the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner has
determined that the following amendment to the Partnership Agreement does not
require the approval of any Limited Partner;

 

WHEREAS, the General Partner has entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the " _Merger Agreement_ ") by and among Targa Resources Corp., a Delaware
corporation, the Partnership, the General Partner, Trident MLP Merger Sub LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company (" _Merger Sub_ "), Atlantis Energy

Merger;

 

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to the APL Parties and the Partnership
entering into the Merger Agreement, the General Partner has agreed to execute
and deliver this Amendment No. 3; and

WHEREAS, the General Partner has determined (i) that the provisions relating
to the reduction of quarterly distributions to holders of Incentive
Distribution Rights provided for in this Amendment No. 3 will be in the best
interests of the Partnership and beneficial to the Limited Partners, including
the holders of the Common Units and (ii) that this Amendment No. 3 does not

as follows:

 

Section 1\. _Amendments_. Section 6.4 is hereby amended by adding a new
subsection (c) to such Section:

 

"(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.4, commencing with

" _First Reduction Quarter_ "), aggregate quarterly distributions, if any, to
holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights provided by clauses (iii)(B),
(iv)(B) and (v)(B) of Subsection 6.4(b) shall be reduced (w) by $9,375,000
per Quarter for the First Reduction Quarter and the following three Quarters,
(x) by $6,250,000 per Quarter for the following four Quarters, (y) by
$2,500,000 per Quarter for the following four Quarters and (z) by $1,250,000
per Quarter for the following four Quarters (the amount reduced each quarter
pursuant to each of (w)  (z) is referred to as the " _Reduced Amount_ ");
_provided_ , that for any such Quarter that is subject to this Section
6.4(c), the Reduced Amount shall be distributed Pro Rata to the holders of
Outstanding Common Units."

 

Section 2\. Except as hereby amended, the Partnership Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect.

 

Section 3\. This Amendment shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware, all rights and remedies being
governed by such laws without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.
