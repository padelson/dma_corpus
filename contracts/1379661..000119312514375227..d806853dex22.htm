if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. The parties acknowledge that payment of the
Cash Consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of New Common Units was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would

been paid or issued to the holder of Partnership Units in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. The Parties agree that the Partnership intends to deliver to Parent a

under Treasury Regulation Sections 1.708-1(c)(1) and 1.708-1(c)(3)(i), whereby both Operating Partnership and the Partnership will be the terminating partnerships and Parent will be the resulting partnership. As a result, the transactions
consummated pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as a contribution of all of the assets of Operating Partnership and the Partnership to Parent in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the cash received in
lieu of fractional New Common Units and the assumption of liabilities. To the maximum extent possible, the Cash Consideration and any cash received in lieu of fractional New Common Units shall be treated as a reimbursement of pre-formation capital
expenditures described in Treasury Regulation <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Section&nbsp;1.707-4(d).</FONT> To the extent the Cash Consideration and the cash received in lieu of fractional New Common Units exceeds the amount that can be so
