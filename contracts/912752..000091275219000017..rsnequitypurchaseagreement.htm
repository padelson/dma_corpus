Amount") equal to (i) $9,600,000,000 (the "Purchase Price"), minus (ii) if
Estimated Closing Net Debt is a positive number, the amount of Estimated
Closing Net Debt, plus (iii) the Unfunded Pension Liability Adjustment Amount
plus (iv) if Estimated Closing Net Debt is a negative number, the absolute
value of Estimated Closing Net Debt, plus (v) (x) Estimated Closing Adjusted

(b) The Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the 30th
day following delivery thereof, unless Seller gives written notice of its

such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable detail
the nature of any disagreement so asserted, (ii) only include disagreements
based on mathematical errors or based on Closing Adjusted Working Capital or
Closing Net Debt not being calculated in accordance with this Agreement and
the Accounting Principles and (iii) set forth Seller's proposed resolution of
each such disagreement. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by Buyer in a
timely manner, then the Statement (as revised in accordance with this
sentence) shall become final and binding upon Seller and Buyer on the earlier

date Seller and Buyer resolve in writing any differences they have with
respect to the matters specified by Seller in the Notice of Disagreement and
(B) the date any disputed matters are finally resolved by the Accounting Firm
pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Section 2.04. During the 30-day
period following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer
shall seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they may have with
respect to the matters specified by Seller in the Notice of Disagreement.
During such period Buyer and its independent accountants and other advisors
shall have access to the working papers of Seller's independent accountants
and other advisors prepared in connection with the Notice of Disagreement. At
the end of such 30-day period, Seller and Buyer shall submit to an independent
accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm") for resolution any and all matters
that were included by Seller in the Notice of Disagreement and that remain in
dispute. The Accounting Firm shall be such nationally recognized independent
public accounting firm as shall be selected by Seller and approved in writing
by Buyer (such approval by Buyer not to be unreasonably withheld).

(c) Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm
to render a written decision resolving the matters submitted to it pursuant to
Section 2.04(b) within 30 days of such submission. In resolving matters
submitted to it pursuant to Section 2.04(b), the Accounting Firm (i) shall
base its decision based solely on written submissions by Seller and Buyer and
their respective representatives and not by independent review and (ii) with
respect to each matter submitted to it, shall not resolve such matter in a
manner that is more favorable to Seller than the Notice of Disagreement or
more favorable to Buyer than the Statement.

(d) The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be
limited to (i) whether there were mathematical errors in the Statement, and
(ii) whether Closing Adjusted Working Capital and Closing Net Debt were
calculated in accordance with this Agreement and the Accounting Principles
with respect to the matters that were submitted to the Accounting Firm for
resolution and (iii) the interest calculation in accordance with Sections
2.04(e) and 2.04(g). The Accounting Firm is not authorized to, and shall not,
make any other determination, including (A) any determination with respect to
any matter included in the Statement or the Notice of Disagreement that was
not submitted to the Accounting Firm for resolution, (B) any determination as
to compliance by Seller or Buyer with any of their respective representations,
warranties or covenants in this Agreement or (C) any determination that an
issue was not properly included by Seller in the Notice of Disagreement. Any
disputes not within the scope of disputes to be resolved by the Accounting
Firm pursuant to this Section 2.04(d) as well as any disputes about the scope
of disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section
2.04(d) shall be resolved in accordance with Section 11.12. Any determination
by the Accounting Firm, and any work or analyses performed by the Accounting
Firm, in connection with its resolution of any dispute under this Section 2.04
may not be offered as evidence in any Proceeding, other than to the extent
necessary to enforce payment obligations under this Section 2.04.

(e) The final determination by the Accounting Firm of the matters submitted to
it pursuant to Section 2.04(b) shall: (i) be in writing; (ii) include the 

Accounting Firm's calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price; (iii) include
the Accounting Firm's determination of each matter submitted to it pursuant to
Section 2.04(b); (iv) include the Accounting Firm's calculation of interest
(in accordance with Section 2.04(g)) from and including the Closing Date to
but excluding the date of determination; and (v) include a brief summary of
the Accounting Firm's reasons for its determination of each issue.

(f) The dispute resolution by the Accounting Firm under this Section 2.04
shall constitute an expert determination under New York CPLR Article 76 and
shall not constitute an arbitration. The determinations of the Accounting Firm
shall be final and binding, absent fraud, bad faith or manifest error.
Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in New
York State Supreme Court or any other court having jurisdiction over the party
against which such determination is to be enforced. The cost of any dispute
resolution (including the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of the parties) pursuant to this
Section 2.04 shall be borne by Seller and Buyer in inverse proportion as they
may prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate
allocations shall also be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the
determination of the Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of the matters
submitted.

(g) The Purchase Price shall be (i) (x) increased by the amount by which
Closing Adjusted Working Capital exceeds the Target Amount or (y) decreased by
the amount by which Closing Adjusted Working Capital is less than the Target
Amount and (ii) (x) if Closing Net Debt is a positive number, decreased by the
amount of Closing Net Debt or (y) if Closing Net Debt is a negative number,
increased by the absolute value of Closing Net Debt (the Purchase Price as so
increased or decreased shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Adjusted
Purchase Price"). If the Closing Date Amount is less than the Adjusted
Purchase Price, Buyer shall, and if the Closing Date Amount is more than the
Adjusted Purchase Price, Seller or the Selling Subsidiary shall, within 10
business days after the Statement becomes final and binding on the parties,
make payment by wire transfer in immediately available funds of the amount of
such difference to one or more bank accounts designated by Buyer, Seller or
the Selling Subsidiary (as applicable), together with interest thereon at a
rate equal to the rate of interest from time to time announced publicly by
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as its prime rate, calculated on the basis of the
actual number of days elapsed divided by 365, from and including the Closing
Date to but excluding the date of payment.

(h) In connection with the determination of Closing Adjusted Working Capital,
Closing Net Debt and the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to this Section
2.04, from the date of delivery by Seller of the estimates described in
Section 2.03(a) through the resolution of any adjustment to the Purchase Price
contemplated by this Section 2.04, Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, afford to Buyer or Seller (as applicable) and
their respective independent accountants and other advisors reasonable access
during regular business hours and in such a manner as to not interfere with
the normal operation of the Business to the personnel, properties, books and
records relating to the Business, including the Transferred Company and its
Subsidiaries, for any purpose reasonably related to the adjustment

ARTICLE IV 

Representations and Warranties of Buyer

Buyer represents and warrants to Seller as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing Date as follows:

SECTION 4.01. Buyer's Organization; Power; Execution. Buyer is a legal entity
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (where such concept is
recognized in the relevant jurisdiction) under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation. Buyer has all requisite power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to carry out, or cause to be carried out, the
transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer has, or will have at the Closing, all
requisite power and authority to execute and deliver each Transaction Document
(other than this Agreement) to which it is or will be a party and to carry
out, or cause to be carried out, the transactions contemplated by each of the
Transaction Documents (other than this Agreement) to which it is or will be a
party, including the Financing. This Agreement has been duly authorized by all
necessary action on the part of Buyer and has been duly executed and delivered
by Buyer and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Seller and the Selling Subsidiary, constitutes a valid and
legally binding obligation of Buyer in 

accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (a)
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
affecting or relating to creditors' rights generally and (b) the availability
of injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. Each of the Transaction
Documents (other than this Agreement) and the Financing has been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of Buyer and has been, or will
be at the Closing, duly executed and delivered by Buyer and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of such Transaction Document by each
other party thereto, constitutes or will constitute a valid and legally
binding obligation of Buyer in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors' rights
generally and (ii) the availability of injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies.

SECTION 4.02. Consents and Approvals; Absence of Violation or Conflicts.
Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents by Buyer, nor the consummation by Buyer of the
Transactions nor compliance by Buyer with any of the provisions hereof or
thereof, including the Financing shall: (i) conflict with or result in any
breach of any provisions of the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or
similar organizational documents of Buyer or any of its Affiliates; (ii)
require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Entity, except (a) those required to be
obtained under the DOJ Action, (b) as may be required with or to the FCC under
the Communications Laws, (c) any consent, approval, authorization or permit
required to be obtained by Seller or filing or notification required to be
made by Seller in order to transfer title to the Transferred Equity Interests
or otherwise operate the Business, which consent, approval, authorization or
permit is customary in transactions of the type contemplated hereby, and (d)
where the failure to obtain any such consent, approval, authorization or
permit, or to make such filing or notification, would not adversely affect, in
any material respect, the ability of Buyer to consummate the Transactions;
(iii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in clause (ii) of this
Section 4.02, violate any Law or Judgment applicable to Buyer; or (iv) result
in a violation of or default (or an event that, with or without notice or
lapse of time or both, would become a default) under, or give rise to a right
of termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a
benefit under, any material Contract to which Buyer is a party or by which any
of its properties is bound, except, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv), for
any such matter that would not, and would not reasonably be expected to,
prohibit or materially delay the consummation by Buyer of the Transactions.

SECTION 4.03. Litigation. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of Buyer, threatened concerning Buyer or any of its Affiliates, nor
is there any Judgment outstanding against Buyer or any of its Affiliates or to
which any of their respective properties is subject, in each case, which would
reasonably be expected to prohibit or materially delay the consummation by
Buyer of the Transactions.

SECTION 4.04. Financing. Buyer has delivered to Seller true and complete
copies of the executed (a) (i) debt commitment letter and related Redacted Fee
Letter, each dated as of May 3, 2019, between Sinclair Television Group, Inc.,
and 

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Royal Bank of
Canada, and Bank of America, N.A. (together in each case with their designated
affiliates) and (ii) debt commitment letter and related Redacted Fee Letter,
each dated as of May 3, 2019, between Buyer and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Royal Bank of Canada, and Bank of America,
N.A. (together in each case with their designated affiliates) (such agreements
described in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, including all exhibits,
schedules, annexes and amendments thereto, as may be modified pursuant to
Section 6.05, the "Debt Financing Commitments"), pursuant to which the
Financing Sources party thereto have agreed, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, to lend the amounts set forth therein (the "Debt
Financing") for the purpose of funding, in part, the Transactions and related
fees and expenses and (b) equity commitment letter (and the related Redacted
Fee Letter) with the equity financing source identified therein, in each case
dated as of May 3, 2019 (such agreements, including all exhibits, schedules,
annexes and amendments thereto, as may be modified pursuant to Section 6.05,
the "Equity Financing Commitment" and, together with the Debt Financing
Commitments, the "Financing Commitments"), pursuant to which the Financing
Sources party thereto have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, to invest the amounts set forth therein (the "Equity Financing", and
together with the Debt Financing, the "Financing") for the purpose of funding,
in part, the Transactions and related fees and expenses. As of the date
hereof, each of the Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, is in
full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer or
Buyer's Affiliates party thereto, as applicable, and to the Buyer's knowledge,
the other parties thereto, except as such enforceability may be limited by (x)
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
affecting or relating to creditors' rights generally and (y) the availability
of injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. As of the date hereof, the
Financing Commitments have not been amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified in any respect, no amendment, supplement or modification is
contemplated in a manner that could reasonably be expected to affect the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article V and the financing
commitments thereunder have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any
respect. No event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach
on the part of Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates party thereto, as applicable, or,
to the Buyer's knowledge, any other parties thereto under any term or
condition of the Financing Commitments, and assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent to Buyer's obligations hereunder, Buyer has no reason to
believe that it (or its Affiliates party thereto) will be unable to satisfy
any term or condition of closing set forth in the Financing Commitments at or
prior to Closing, or that any portion of the Financing to be made thereunder
will otherwise not be available to Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates party thereto,
as applicable, to consummate the Transactions at the time required pursuant to
this Agreement. Buyer has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all
commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Commitments to be paid
thereunder on or prior to the date of this Agreement. The Financing, when
funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments, together with cash on
hand or other sources of immediately available funds, will provide Buyer
(directly or indirectly through its Affiliates party thereto) with funds
sufficient to satisfy all of Buyer's obligations under this Agreement,
including the obligations under Article II, pay any other amounts required to
be paid by Buyer in connection with the consummation of the 

Transactions and pay all related fees and expenses of Buyer. The obligations
to make the Financing available to Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates party thereto,
as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the Financing Commitments are not
subject to any conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth
in the Financing Commitments (including, with respect to the Debt Financing,
satisfaction of the Marketing Period and changes effected pursuant to the
"market flex" provisions in the applicable Redacted Fee Letter). As of the
date of this Agreement, there are no agreements, arrangements or
understandings (whether oral or written) or commitments to enter into
agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written) to which
Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party related to the Financing other than
as expressly contained in the Financing Commitments and delivered to Seller
prior to the date hereof (except for customary engagement letters or non-
disclosure agreements which do not impact the availability of the Financing).
For the avoidance of doubt, it is not a condition to Closing under this
Agreement for Buyer or its Affiliates to obtain the Financing or any
alternative financing.

SECTION 4.05. Solvency. Assuming (i) satisfaction of the conditions to Buyer's
obligation to consummate the Transactions, and after giving effect to the
Transactions, the Financing and the payment of the Purchase Price, any
repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the
Financing Commitments and (ii) the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of Seller set forth in Article III hereof in all material respects,
Buyer will be Solvent immediately after the completion of the Closing. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Solvent" when used with respect to any
person, means that, as of any date of determination (A) the amount of the
"fair saleable value" of the assets of such person will, as of such date,
exceed (1) the value of all "liabilities of such person, including a
reasonable estimate of the amount of all known contingent and other
liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined
in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency
of debtors, and (2) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of such person, as of such date, on its existing debts (including
contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature,
(B) such person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount
of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged following such date, and (C) such person will be able
to pay its liabilities, including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all
known contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this
definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged"
and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities,
as they mature" means that such person will be able to generate enough cash
from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof,
to meet its obligations as they become due.

SECTION 4.06. Brokerage Fees. There are no claims for brokerage commissions,
finders' fees or similar compensation in connection with the Transactions
based on any arrangement or agreement made by or on behalf of Buyer or any
Affiliate thereof. 

SECTION 4.07. Securities Act. The Transferred Equity Interests are being
acquired for investment only and not with a view to any public distribution
thereof, and neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer shall offer to sell or
otherwise dispose of the Transferred Equity Interests so acquired by it in
violation of any of the registration requirements of the United States
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").

SECTION 4.08. Parent Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Buyer has delivered to Seller a guarantee, dated the date hereof,
of Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. (the "Buyer Parent") guaranteeing certain of
Buyer's payment obligations hereunder (the "Parent Guarantee"). The Parent
Guarantee is in full force and effect and is a valid, legal, binding and
enforceable obligation of Buyer Parent, except as such enforceability may be
limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors' rights generally and (b) the
availability of injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of Buyer Parent under its Parent Guarantee.
Nothing in this Section 4.08 shall be construed to limit in any way Seller's
right to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement as contemplated by Section 11.06(b), subject to the limitations set
forth in Article X.

SECTION 4.09. Operations and Liabilities of Buyer. Buyer is a newly formed
entity and has been specifically formed at the direction of Buyer Parent for
the purpose of entering into this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and consummating the Transactions. Buyer has no operations and has
not conducted any business other than in connection with this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents and the Transactions. As of the date of this
Agreement, Buyer has not, and as of the Closing Date will not have, incurred
any liabilities or other obligations (other than to Seller pursuant to this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or otherwise in connection with
consummating the Transactions).

shall cause its Affiliates and representatives not to, originate any
publicity, news release or other similar public announcement, written or oral,
whether relating to this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents
(excluding, solely for purposes of this Section 6.02, the Transition Services
Agreement) or the existence of any arrangement between the parties, without
the prior written consent of (a) Buyer, in the case of a proposed disclosure
by Seller, the Selling Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives; or (b) Seller, in the case of a proposed disclosure by Buyer
or any of its Affiliates or representatives, whether or not named in such
publicity, news release or other similar public announcement, except either

announcement as may be required by applicable Law or stock exchange regulation
or any listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly traded securities;
provided that in such event, the party issuing the same shall still be 

required, to the extent permitted by such Law, regulation or agreement, to
consult with Seller or Buyer (as applicable), whether or not named in such
publicity, news release or other similar public announcement, a reasonable
time prior to its release to allow the other party to comment thereon and,
after its release, shall provide the other party with a copy thereof.

SECTION 6.03. Effort; Regulatory Approval.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Seller
shall use its reasonable best efforts and Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use its best efforts (unless, with respect to any action,
another standard of performance is expressly provided for herein, including in
Section 6.03(d)) to (i) obtain consents, approvals (including pursuant to any
anti-trust or competition Law or Judgment), authorizations, qualifications and
orders of Governmental Entities and other third parties, (ii) as soon as
reasonably practicable, make all necessary registrations, declarations,
submissions and filings with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions
required under any applicable Law or the DOJ Action and (iii) take, or cause
to be taken, all other actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things, in
each case as is necessary to consummate the Transactions as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement; provided that Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall have no obligation to pay money or, except as provided in
Section 6.03(c) and (d), shall be under no obligation to commence, defend or
participate in any litigation in connection therewith or to offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party in connection
therewith. For the avoidance of doubt, obtaining the consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications or orders described in the first sentence of
this Section 6.03(a) is not a condition to the consummation of the Closing
solely by virtue of inclusion in this Section 6.03(a). In addition to the
foregoing, Buyer agrees to, and to cause its Affiliates to, provide such
evidence as to financial capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be
reasonably requested by any third party whose consent or approval is sought
hereunder. Subject to appropriate confidentiality protections, each of the
parties hereto will cooperate with and furnish to the other party such
necessary information and assistance as such other party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, Seller and Buyer shall, and Buyer shall
cause its Affiliates to, (i) seek approval by the DOJ of this Agreement and
Buyer as the acquiror of the Business, as required by the DOJ Action, and (ii)
submit any additional information necessary or requested by the DOJ in
connection with such approval and the review and consideration by the DOJ of
the Transactions. Seller and Buyer shall, and Buyer shall cause its Affiliates
to, promptly inform the other party of, and, subject to appropriate
confidentiality protections, provide copies of, any material communication
made by such party to, or received by such party from, any Governmental Entity
(including the DOJ) and any requests for additional information from any
Governmental Entity (including the DOJ) with respect to the Transactions (it
being agreed, however, that to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, Seller and Buyer shall not, and Buyer shall cause its Affiliates not
to, make any such written communication without the prior review and comment
of Buyer or Seller (as applicable) or their counsel, provided that such
materials 

may be redacted as necessary to remove references concerning the valuation of
the Business or Buyer's plans for operating the Business after consummation of
the Transactions) and, to the extent practicable, subject to appropriate
confidentiality protections, provide each other and their respective counsel
with advance notice of and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, the opportunity to participate in any in-person discussion or meeting
with any Governmental Entity (including the DOJ, provided the DOJ does not
object to such notice or participation) in respect of any filing,
investigation or other inquiry in connection with the Transactions and to
participate in the preparation for such discussion or meeting. Seller shall
use its reasonable best efforts and Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use its best efforts to take any and all steps necessary to
obtain the approval by the DOJ of this Agreement and Buyer as the acquiror of
the Business so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
practicable. In the event the DOJ requests any changes to this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to
amend, and shall amend, any such agreement to reflect the changes so requested
in a manner that, to the fullest extent possible, preserves the economic
benefits intended to be obtained by Seller and Buyer from the Transactions.

(c) If any objections are asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to
the Transactions under any applicable anti-trust or competition Law or
Communications Law or the DOJ Action which would otherwise prevent, materially
impede or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions, or if any
action is instituted by any Governmental Entity or any private party
challenging the Transactions as violative of any applicable anti-trust or
competition Law or Communications Law, or an order is issued enjoining the
Transactions, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts and Buyer shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its best efforts (unless, with respect
to any action, another standard of performance is expressly provided for
herein, including in Section 6.03(d)) to resolve any such objection or suits
so as to permit consummation of the Transactions as soon as practicable.

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, promptly take such actions as are necessary to secure the
approval by the DOJ of this Agreement and Buyer, as the acquiror of the
Business as required by the DOJ Action and to resolve any objections asserted
with respect to the Transactions under any applicable Law or Judgment raised
by any Governmental Entity (including the DOJ), in order to prevent the entry
of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any Judgment that
would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the
Transactions or to comply with any Judgment requiring DOJ approval, including
(i) (A) within forty-five (45) days after the date of this Agreement,
proposing and using best efforts to execute settlements, undertakings, consent
decrees, stipulations or other agreements with any Governmental Entity
(including the DOJ) or with any other Person (if such Governmental Entity or
other Person is willing to so agree) that provide, inter alia, for the relief
set forth in the remainder of this subparagraph (d), (B) within forty-five
(45) days after the date of this Agreement proposing to sell, divest or
otherwise convey and/or hold separate particular assets or categories of
assets or businesses of Buyer and its Affiliates, to the full extent of
Buyer's obligation under this subparagraph (d) if and as necessary to obtain
approval by the DOJ of this Agreement and Buyer, (C) within forty- 

five (45) days after the date of this Agreement, agreeing (if the DOJ is
willing to so agree) to sell, divest or otherwise convey or hold separate any
particular assets or categories of assets or businesses of the Business
contemporaneously with or subsequent to the Closing, (D) permitting Seller to
sell, divest or otherwise convey or hold separate any of the particular assets
or categories of assets or businesses of the Business prior to the Closing,
(E) terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of
the Transferred Company or its Subsidiaries or Buyer or its Affiliates, (F)
terminating any joint venture or other arrangement, (G) creating any
relationship, contractual right or obligation of the Transferred Company or
its Subsidiaries or Buyer or its Affiliates or (H) effectuating any other
change or restructuring of the Transferred Company or its Subsidiaries or
Buyer or its Affiliates (and, in each case, entering into agreements or
stipulating to the entry of any Judgment by, or filing appropriate
applications with, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity in connection with
any of the foregoing and, in the case of actions by or with respect to the
Business, by consenting to such action by Seller (including any consents
required under this Agreement with respect to such action); provided that any
such action may be conditioned upon the Closing) and (ii) in the event that
any administrative or judicial Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging the
Transactions, to contest and resist any such Proceeding, including defending
through litigation, including on the merits, any claims asserted in any court
or administrative or other tribunal by any Person (including any Governmental
Entity), and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Judgment,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions. From the
Closing Date until the date that is one year after the Closing Date, Buyer
agrees that it will not sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all
of the Business. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer's obligations under this
Section 6.03(d) shall be absolute and shall not be qualified or limited by
what may be considered reasonable or commercially reasonable but shall be
qualified and limited by the next sentence; provided, however, that it is also
agreed and understood by Seller and Buyer that, under the Proposed Final
Judgement filed in the DOJ Action, the DOJ may, in its sole discretion, reject
the Buyer as the acquiror of the Business and/or otherwise determine not to
approve this Agreement or the Transactions notwithstanding Buyer's compliance
with its obligations under this Agreement, including this Section 6.03, and,
as such, Buyer cannot, and does not, guarantee approval by the DOJ of the
Buyer as the acquiror of the Business, this Agreement and/or the Transactions
(it being understood that the foregoing proviso shall not in any way limit the
Buyer's obligations under this Agreement, including this Section 6.03).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as expressly disclosed in Section
6.01(c) of the Disclosure Letter, nothing in this Agreement shall (1) require
Buyer or its Affiliates to sell, divest, otherwise convey or materially
restrict (or agree to sell, divest, otherwise convey or materially restrict)
any Regional Sports Network (or any interest therein) contemporaneously with
or subsequent to the Closing, (2) permit Seller to sell, divest, otherwise
convey or materially restrict any Regional Sports Network (or any interest
therein) prior to the Closing, and/or (3) require Buyer or its Affiliates to
sell, divest, hold separate, otherwise convey or materially restrict, (or
propose to sell, divest, hold separate, otherwise convey or materially
restrict), any broadcast television station (or any interest 

therein) other than broadcast television stations listed on Section 6.03(d) of
the Disclosure Letter, in each case, whether or not requested by the DOJ.

SECTION 6.04. Pre-Closing Access.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or the
valid termination of this Agreement, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights
under the Separation Agreement to cause New Fox to, (i) permit Buyer, the
Financing Sources and their respective accountants, legal counsel and other
representatives, to conduct (and cooperate with Buyer's and the Financing
Sources') customary due diligence investigations with respect to the Business,
(ii) give Buyer, the Financing Sources and their respective accountants, legal
counsel and other representatives reasonable access upon reasonable advance
notice, for the sole purpose of allowing Buyer to successfully transition the
Business or allowing the Financing Sources to consummate the Financing, during
normal business hours and without undue interruption of Seller's or New Fox's
or any of their respective Affiliates' normal operation of their respective
businesses, including the Business, to all of the employees, properties, books
and records relating to the Business (including any employees of New Fox
formerly involved in the Business), and (iii) furnish, at Buyer's expense,
Buyer, the Financing Sources and their respective accountants, legal counsel
and other representatives during such period all such information concerning
the affairs of the Business as Buyer or the Financing Sources may reasonably
request; provided that this Section 6.04(a) shall not require Seller or New
Fox to provide Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
representatives with access to any document, communication or information (x)
related to the Transactions, the sale process with respect to the Business or
the possible sale of the Business, (y) that Seller or New Fox believes in good
faith to be covered by any attorney-client work product or similar privilege
or the subject of a confidentiality agreement, or (z) the disclosure of which
is prohibited by applicable Law or Judgment; provided that Seller shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
enforce its rights under the Separation Agreement to cause New Fox to, use
reasonable best efforts to provide such document, communication or information
in a manner that does not result in a waiver of such privilege or a violation
of such agreement, Law or Judgment; provided, further, that this Section
6.04(a) shall not entitle Buyer or its accountants, legal counsel or other
representatives to contact any third party doing business with the Business
without Seller's prior written consent.

(b) All information received by Buyer, the Financing Sources or any of their
respective representatives and given by or on behalf of Seller in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions will be held by (i) in the case of
Buyer and its Affiliates and representatives as confidential information
pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement until the Closing, at
which time such Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to
information relating to the Business and (ii) in the case of the Financing
Sources, in accordance with the confidentiality requirements in the Financing
Commitments. Buyer acknowledges that (x) any and all other information
provided to it by Seller or any of its Affiliates or representatives shall
remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement
from and after Closing and (y) 

if this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in all
respects.

(c) From and after the date hereof and to the Closing, without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent may be withheld by Seller in its sole
discretion for any reason or no reason, neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates shall contact any suppliers or vendors to, or Employees of the
Business (except pursuant to Section 6.04(a)) or customers of, the Business in
connection with or pertaining to any subject matter of this Agreement.

SECTION 6.05. Financing. (a) Buyer shall, and shall cause its applicable
Affiliates party to the Financing Commitments to, use reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Financing as
promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms (including, with respect to
the Debt Financing, the "market flex" provisions) and subject only to the
conditions contained in the Financing Commitments and in Sections 5.01 and
5.02 herein, and completion of the Marketing Period, including to (i)
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing
on the terms (including, with respect to the Debt Financing, the "market flex"
provisions) and subject only to the conditions contained in the Financing
Commitments or on other terms acceptable to Buyer, so long as such definitive
agreements (A) do not contain any additional or modified conditions or other
contingencies to the funding of the Financing than those contained in the
Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement and (B) do not reduce
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing set forth in the Financing
Commitments as of the date of this Agreement, unless (1) in case of this
clause (B), replaced with an amount of new debt or equity financing on
conditions no less favorable to Seller than the terms set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment or the Equity Financing Commitment, as applicable, as of
the date hereof and (2) in case of the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), such
agreements are not reasonably likely to impair or delay the funding of the
Financing or the Closing, (ii) satisfy, and cause its Affiliates to satisfy,
on a timely basis (after giving effect to the entire period of the Marketing
Period) all conditions applicable to Buyer or its Affiliates contained in the
Financing Commitments and (iii) consummate the Financing at the Closing.

(b) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 6.05, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to
consummate the Transactions on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein are not conditioned upon the availability or consummation of the
Financing, the availability of any replacement commitments or receipt of the
proceeds therefrom.

(c) Buyer shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or other
modification of, or waive any of its rights under, any Financing Commitments
or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing without Seller's prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided
that Buyer may amend, supplement or modify the Financing Commitments or the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing without Seller's prior written
consent if such amendment, supplement or modification would not: (i) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Financing set forth in the 

Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement, (ii) contain any
additional or modified conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the
applicable Financing than those contained in the applicable Financing
Commitments as of the date of this Agreement or (iii) modify in a manner
adverse to Buyer or its Affiliates party thereto, as applicable, the
conditions to the funding, enforceability, availability or termination of the
Financing, in any case under the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), that
would make the impairment or delay of the funding of the Financing or the
Closing reasonably likely. It is agreed and understood that, notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer may (A) amend the Financing
Commitments to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, agents, syndication
agents, documentation agents, investors, or similar entities who had not
executed the Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement in
accordance with the provisions hereof and of the Financing Commitments and (B)
amend or otherwise modify the Debt Financing Commitments to implement any
"market flex" provisions applicable thereto.

(d) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including, with respect to the Debt Financing, the "market flex"
provisions) contained in the Financing Commitments, Buyer shall promptly
notify Seller, and Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use
reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, replacement commitments on terms that will enable
Buyer to consummate the Transactions; provided that such replacement
commitments shall not be subject to any additional or modified conditions or
other contingencies to the funding of the Financing that would, individually
or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to impair or delay the funding of
the Financing or the Closing (after giving effect to the entire period of the
Marketing Period). Buyer shall deliver to Seller complete and correct copies
of all amendments, supplements, other modifications or agreements (including
Redacted Fee Letters) pursuant to which any amended, supplemented, modified or
replacement commitments shall provide Buyer (directly or indirectly through
its Affiliates party thereto) with any portion of the Financing. Upon any
amendment, supplement, modification or replacement of the Financing
Commitments in accordance with this Section 6.05, the terms "Debt Financing",
"Debt Financing Commitment", "Redacted Fee Letter", "Equity Financing", and
"Equity Financing Commitment" shall be in reference to such amended,
supplemented, modified or replaced commitment.

(e) Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective legal counsel and
other advisors and the Transferred Company's accountants, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide cooperation in connection with the arrangement
of the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Buyer; provided that (i)
such requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of Seller and its Affiliates, (ii) Seller shall not be required to
provide any audited or unaudited "carve-out" financial statements of the
Business other than the Financial Statements and (iii) such cooperation shall
not cause any representation, warranty, covenant or other term in this
Agreement to be breached or cause any closing condition set forth in Article V
to fail to be satisfied), including the following actions: 

(i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings with the Financing
Sources (and to cause the members of senior management and representatives of
the Business to participate in such meetings), rating agency presentations,
road shows, and due diligence sessions, and cooperating reasonably with the
marketing efforts of Buyer and the Financing Sources, in each case upon
reasonable notice and at mutually agreed upon dates and times;

(ii) assisting Buyer and the Financing Sources in the preparation of rating
agency presentations, offering documents, bank information memoranda
(including a version thereof that does not contain material non-public
information), lender and investor presentations, and other similar materials
for any debt or equity financing, including to cause the execution and
delivery of reasonable and customary representation letters, authorization
letters and solvency certificates and to furnish records, data or other
information necessary to support material statistical information or claims
relating to the Business appearing in the aforementioned materials; in each
case in this clause (ii): (A) subject to customary confidentiality provisions
and disclaimers, (B) required or customary in connection with the Financing,
(C) as requested by Buyer and (D) limited to information to be contained
therein with respect to the Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries;

practicable (A) (1) the Financial Statements, (2) the audited combined balance

(including the comparable prior year period) and (4) such other historical
financial information and operating data relating to the Audited Entities
(excluding YES Network Holding Company, LLC) reasonably necessary to permit
Buyer to complete a private placement of non-convertible debt securities
(including information required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the
Securities Act that is also of a type and form customarily included in an
offering memorandum with respect to a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act for financings similar to the Debt Financing and
subject to exceptions customary for such financings such as the omission of
(x) Compensation Disclosure and Analysis required by Regulation S-K Item
402(b) and (y) any information required by Items 10 through 14 of Form 10-K
(other than Item 13 as it relates to Item 404 of Regulation S-K)), including

the Seller, and 

which is (1) reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the preparation
of a confidential information memorandum and offering documents customary for

on the date hereof and (2) reasonably necessary in order to consummate the
Financing, including in connection with Buyer's preparation of customary pro
forma financial information (excluding any historical financial statements,
which are addressed in clause (A) above) (all of the foregoing, the "Required
Information"), all of which is Compliant;

(iv) using reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are reasonably
requested by Buyer or the Financing Sources to facilitate the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments (including, with respect
to the Debt Financing, reasonably facilitating the taking of collateral

actions by the Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries; provided that any
such taking of collateral or corporate actions shall be contingent upon and
effective as of the Closing;

(v) to the extent required in connection with the Financing, requesting the
Audited Entities' independent accountants to provide reasonable assistance to
Buyer consistent with customary practices (including to provide consent to
Buyer to use audit reports relating to the Financial Statements, on customary

provided that, notwithstanding the requirements of Section 6.05(e), (i) Seller
and its Affiliates shall not be required to enter into or approve any
certificate, document or agreement which will be effective prior to the
Closing Date (other than customary representation letters, authorization

or that would be inaccurate in light of the facts and circumstances at the
time approved, authorized, executed or delivered, (ii) Seller and its
Affiliates shall not be required to pay any commitment or other fee or incur
any other liability (including any guarantee, indemnity, or pledge) in
connection with the Financing (in the case of the Transferred Company, prior
to the Closing Date), (iii) nothing herein will require Seller and its
Affiliates or any of their respective representatives to provide any
information or take any action, the disclosure or taking 

of which would reasonably be expected to violate applicable Law, any fiduciary
duty, any Contract, or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party,
or jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client privilege (it being agreed
that the Seller shall give notice to Buyer of the fact that it is withholding
such information or documents on any such basis, shall withhold only that
portion of such information that is reasonably necessary to be withheld to not
violate applicable Law, duty, Contract, or obligation and to preserve
attorney-client privilege, and thereafter Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not
reasonably be expected to violate such Law, duty, Contract, or obligation or
waive attorney-client privilege) and (iv) Seller and its Affiliates and their
respective representatives shall not be required to deliver any legal opinion
or negative assurance letter in connection with the Financing.

(f) Seller shall give Buyer notice if it becomes aware that the Required
Information taken as a whole is or becomes incorrect in any material respect.
From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, Seller hereby consents
for Buyer to use the logos owned by the Business and listed on Section 6.05(f)
of the Disclosure Letter, provided that such logos shall be used solely on
materials reasonably necessary for the Financing and in a manner that is
customary for Financings of this type and solely in a manner that does not
harm or disparage the Business, the Transferred Company or any of its
Affiliates or their reputation or goodwill. All non-public information
regarding the Transferred Company and its Affiliates provided to any of Buyer,
the Financing Sources or their respective representatives pursuant to this
Section 6.05 shall be kept confidential, except for disclosure to potential
lenders and investors and their respective representatives that is reasonably
required in connection with the Financing or that is otherwise required to be
disclosed by the Buyer in connection with the Financing, subject to customary
confidentiality protections to the extent applicable.

(g) Buyer shall, promptly upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller for all
out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with such cooperation under this Section 6.05. Buyer and its
Subsidiaries shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and its Subsidiaries from and against any costs, damages, losses,
expenses, or other Liabilities suffered or incurred by them in connection with
the arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith.

(h) Buyer shall keep Seller informed on a timely basis of the status of the
Financing and any material developments relating to the Financing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall give Seller prompt
notice of (i) any default or breach (or any event that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach) by any party under the Financing Commitments or the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing of which Buyer becomes aware,
(ii) any termination of the Financing Commitments, (iii) the receipt of any
written notice or other written communication from any Person party to a
Financing Commitment with respect to any (x) actual or potential default,
breach, termination or repudiation of any Financing Commitment, any definitive
agreement relating to the Financing or any provision of the Financing
Commitments or the definitive agreements 

relating to the Financing, in each case by any party thereto, or (y) material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing
Commitment or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing, with
respect to the obligation to fund the Financing, including any condition with
respect to the obligation to fund the Financing, or the amount of Financing to
be funded on the Closing Date, (iv) if for any reason Buyer believes in good
faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing
Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing and (v) any
amendment, supplement or modifications of, or waiver of any rights under, any
Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements with respect to the
Financing (other than any amendment, supplement, modification or waiver
effected to modify pricing terms, add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities which had not executed the Financing
Commitments as of the date hereof and to implement or exercise any of the
"market flex" provisions in the applicable Redacted Fee Letter). As soon as
reasonably practicable, and in any event, within two business days after the
date Seller delivers to Buyer a written request, Buyer shall provide any
information reasonably requested by Seller relating to any circumstance
referred to in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of the immediately
preceding sentence.

(i) Buyer acknowledges that the information being provided to it in connection
with the Financing is subject to the terms of Section 6.02 and Section
6.04(b). With respect to information disclosed to any rating agency (the
"Confidential Rating Agency Information"), Buyer shall (i) inform such rating
agency of the confidential nature of the Confidential Rating Agency
Information and mark any such information provided in writing to such rating
agency as "confidential" and (ii) require such rating agency not to disclose
the Confidential Rating Agency Information to any third party or to
specifically exclude such information in such ratings agency's ratings report.
Buyer shall be responsible for any breach of this covenant by any such rating
agency.

SECTION 6.06. Intercompany Accounts and Contracts. (a) Prior to 11:59 p.m.,
New York City time, on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all intercompany accounts
between Seller and any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Company
and its Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Transferred Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, to be net settled or otherwise
eliminated, except as set forth on Section 6.06(a) of the Disclosure Letter or
as otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties, effective as of 11:59 p.m,
New York City time, on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date. Prior
to 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the date immediately prior to the
Closing Date, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary
(including Section 6.01), Seller and its Subsidiaries shall have the right to
facilitate the settling or elimination of intercompany accounts as
contemplated by this Section 6.06, in each case in such manner as Seller may
determine in its sole discretion (including by means of declaring, setting
aside or paying any dividend or distribution, purchasing or redeeming equity
interests, creating or repaying intercompany debt, increasing or decreasing
cash pool balances, making any contribution or otherwise). Any such
intercompany accounts that are not settled or otherwise eliminated as
contemplated by this Section 6.06 shall be included in the calculation of the
Adjusted Working Capital. 

(b) Prior to Closing, Seller shall terminate, or cause to be terminated,
effective as of the Closing, all Contracts, including all obligations to
provide goods, services or other benefits, but excluding the Transaction
Documents, between Seller and any of its Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the
Transferred Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand ("Affiliate
Contracts"), except as set forth on Section 6.06(b) of the Disclosure Letter
or as otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties, without any party to such
Contracts having any continuing obligation to the other parties thereto or any
Liabilities thereunder.

SECTION 6.07. Transferred Contracts. (a) At the Closing, except as set forth
on Section 3.08(d) of the Disclosure Letter, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise deliver the Transferred
Contracts to Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries (including, as of the Closing,
the Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries), as directed by Buyer,
including, in the case of Shared Contracts, by assigning, pursuant to an
agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A, the portion of such
Shared Contract relating to the operation and conduct of the Business or using
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable third party to enter
into an amendment or a new agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer, in each case, such that Buyer or its applicable Subsidiary receives all
of the benefits and bears all of the costs, liabilities and burdens with
respect to such Transferred Contracts (or the applicable portion thereof in
the case of a Shared Contract) from and after the Closing. To the extent that
the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery or attempted sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to Buyer or one of its
Subsidiaries (including, as of the Closing, the Transferred Company and its
Subsidiaries) of any Transferred Contract is prohibited by any applicable Law
or would require any governmental or third party authorizations, approvals,
consents, amendments or waivers, the parties shall use reasonable best efforts
to cooperate with each other to obtain promptly such authorizations,
approvals, consents, amendments or waivers prior to the Closing; provided,
however, that Seller shall not be required to pay any consideration or make
any concession therefor except as may be required in connection with the DOJ
Action. For the avoidance of doubt, obtaining the authorizations, approvals,
consents, amendments and waivers described in the preceding sentence is not a
condition to the Closing of the Transactions by virtue of this Section
6.07(a).

(b) If such authorization, approval, consent, amendment or waiver is obtained,
Seller shall assign, transfer, convey or deliver any such Transferred Contract
to Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries (including, as of the Closing, the
Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries), as directed by Buyer, at no
additional cost at the Closing.

(c) If, at the Closing, such authorization, approval, consent, amendment or
waiver shall not have been obtained, (i) such Transferred Contract shall not
be transferred to Buyer (or to the Transferred Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) unless and until such authorization, approval, consent,
amendment or waiver shall have been obtained and (ii) from and after the
Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (x) cooperate with
Buyer to seek mutually acceptable alternative arrangements (including by way
of amendment or addition of services to the Transition Services Agreement) for
purposes of providing the rights and liabilities and obligations under such
Transferred Contract to 

Buyer from and after the Closing (provided that such arrangements shall not
result in a breach or violation of such Transferred Contract) (an "Acceptable
Alternative Arrangement"), (y) not waive any rights related to, or terminate
(or consent to the termination of), any such Transferred Contract (or the
applicable portion thereof in the case of a Shared Contract), except in
connection with the expiration of any such Contract in accordance with its
terms; and (z) provide written notice to Buyer as soon as reasonably
practicable (and in no event later than five (5) business days) after receipt
of any notice of breach received from a counterparty to any such Transferred
Contract; provided that the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
performance by Seller under this Section 6.07(c) shall be borne by Buyer to
the extent not related to or arising out of the gross negligence, fraud or
willful misconduct of Seller or any of its Affiliates. Such Acceptable
Alternative Arrangements may include a subcontracting, sublicensing or
subleasing arrangement under which Buyer and its applicable Subsidiaries
(including the Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries) would, in compliance
with applicable Law, obtain the benefits under, and assume the obligations and
bear the economic burdens associated with, such Transferred Contract (or
applicable portion thereof in the case of a Shared Contract) from and after
the Closing, or under which Seller and its Affiliates would, upon the request
of Buyer, enforce for the benefit (and at the expense) of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries) any and
all of Seller's or its Affiliates' rights against such third party under such
Transferred Contract (or applicable portion thereof in the case of a Shared
Contract) from and after the Closing. If such authorization, approval,
consent, amendment or waiver is obtained after the Closing, Seller shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, assign, transfer, convey or deliver any such
Transferred Contract to Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries (including the
Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries), as directed by Buyer, at no
additional cost.

(d) The parties agree to take the actions set forth on Section 3.08(d) of the
Disclosure Letter.

SECTION 6.08. Resignations. Unless otherwise requested by Buyer, at or prior
to Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer the resignations of all officers and
directors of the Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries.

Cincinnati Sale Right and the sale of such FSN Cincinnati Member's equity
interests in Fox Sports Net Cincinnati, LLC, is completed prior to Closing,

compliance with the Fox Sports Sun LLC Agreement, Fox shall cause to be
delivered to Tampa Bay Rays Baseball, Ltd. (the "Rays Member") a Fox Sale
Notice (as defined in the Fox Sports Sun LLC Agreement) that is consistent
with Section 6.09(c) of the Disclosure Letter. Buyer hereby acknowledges that
the Rays Interest Holders (as defined in the Fox Sports Sun LLC Agreement) may

Section 11.6(b) of the Fox Sports Sun LLC Agreement to require Sunshine Holdco
Corporation or its designee to purchase the equity interests in Fox Sports
Sun, LLC held by the Rays Member, and, if the Rays Member elects to exercise
the Rays Sale Right, Buyer shall purchase such equity interests in accordance
with Section 11.6(f) of the Fox Sports Sun LLC Agreement.

(d) Buyer and Seller hereby acknowledge that a Fox Sale Notice (as defined in
the FSN Arizona LP Agreement) has been delivered to AZ Baseball Media Limited

Right") pursuant to Section 11.5(b) of the FSN Arizona LP Agreement to require
Fox Sports Net Arizona, L.P. ("FSN Arizona") or its designee to purchase the
equity interests in FSN Arizona held by the FSN Arizona Partner. Seller hereby
agrees that in the event that such purchase has not been consummated at or
prior to the Closing, Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the FSN
Arizona Partner the Fair Market Value (as defined in the FSN Arizona LP
Agreement as in effect on the Closing Date) when due in accordance with the
FSN Arizona LP Agreement as in effect on the Closing Date. In the event that
such Fair Market Value has not been finally determined prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer agrees that Seller shall exercise all of the rights of the
Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the determination
of such Fair Market Value under the FSN Arizona LP Agreement, including having
control over negotiations and communications with the FSN Arizona Partner and
the selection of and communications with appraisers; provided that Seller
shall (i) keep Buyer informed of all material developments and consult with
Buyer on a regular basis in connection therewith and (ii) reimburse Buyer for
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates in connection with the determination of such Fair Market Value
or any disputes relating thereto (including compliance by Buyer with its
obligations under this Section 6.09(d)). Buyer agrees that it will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with, and provide all necessary
information reasonably requested by, Seller in connection with the 

foregoing. From the Closing Date until the final determination of the Fair
Market Value (as defined in the FSN Arizona LP Agreement as in effect on the
Closing Date), Buyer agrees that it will not, and it will cause its
Subsidiaries not to, consent to or agree to any amendment, modification or
waiver of the FSN Arizona LP Agreement that would reasonably be expected to
have the effect of increasing the Fair Market Value that is required to be
paid by Seller pursuant to this Section 6.09(d) or otherwise materially
adversely impact Seller's rights or obligations under this Section 6.09(d).

pay Buyer or its designee, by wire transfer in immediately available funds to
one or more bank accounts designated by Buyer, (i) the amount of such First

ARTICLE VII 

Post-Closing Covenants

SECTION 7.01. Post-Closing Access. For a period of six (6) years after the
Closing, Buyer will, and will cause its Subsidiaries (including the
Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries) to, permit Seller and its duly
authorized representatives access for any reasonable business purpose during
normal business hours (upon reasonable advance written notice to Buyer) to all
Contracts, books, records and other data relating to the Business, the
Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries and the Transferred Equity Interests
conveyed and assumed at the Closing, in each case, with respect to periods
prior to the Closing, to the extent that such materials were delivered to
Buyer, except where such access is prohibited by applicable Law or Judgment;
provided that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of Buyer and its Affiliates. Seller shall, and shall cause its
representatives to, maintain the confidentiality of any such Contracts, books,
records and other data in accordance with Section 7.06. Seller agrees that
after the Closing, Buyer or its authorized representatives 

may, at Buyer's cost and expense, make copies of those books and records (or
redacted portions thereof) that have not been transferred to Buyer or such
other information in the possession or control of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent relating to the Business for any
reasonable business purpose, except where providing copies is prohibited by
applicable Law or Judgment. No party shall be required to provide access to
books and records pursuant to this Section 7.01 to the extent such access, in
such party's reasonable judgment would (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or
legal privilege (other than books and records subject to joint defense or
common interest privilege); provided that the requested party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide such document, communication or information
in a manner that does not result in a waiver of such privilege or (ii)
contravene any fiduciary duty or confidentiality obligation.

SECTION 7.02. Insurance. (a) Except as expressly set forth in the Ancillary
Agreements or expressly permitted pursuant to Section 7.02(b) and Section
7.02(c), the coverage under all insurance policies related to the Business and
arranged or maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates is only for the
benefit of Seller or its Affiliates, and not for the benefit of Buyer, the
Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries or the Business. Except as expressly
set forth in the Ancillary Agreements, as of the Closing, Buyer agrees to
arrange for its own insurance policies with respect to the Business covering
all periods and, except as expressly permitted pursuant to Section 7.02(b) and
Section 7.02(c), agrees not to seek, through any means, to benefit from any of
Seller's or its Affiliates' insurance policies which may provide coverage for
claims relating in any way to the Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries and
the Business (other than in respect of claims arising out facts,
circumstances, events or matters occurring prior to the Closing).

(b) The parties acknowledge that the Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries
may be entitled to the benefit of coverage under the insurance policies of
Seller or its Affiliates (the "Retained Policies") with respect to acts,
facts, circumstances or omissions occurring prior to the Closing ("Pre-Closing
Occurrences"), and, for a one-year period concluding on the first anniversary
of the Closing Date, Seller hereby authorizes Buyer to report any and all Pre-
Closing Occurrences arising in connection with the Transferred Company and its
Subsidiaries or the Business (to the extent the damages, losses and
liabilities with respect to such Pre-Closing Occurrences were not taken into
account in connection with the Purchase Price adjustment under Section 2.04)
to the applicable insurance providers to the extent permitted under the
applicable Retained Policy, and where not permitted, agrees, upon receipt of a
written request by Buyer, to make such report on Buyer's behalf.

(c) With respect to claims for Pre-Closing Occurrences made pursuant to
Section 7.02(b), (i) if reported to the applicable insurance provider by
Buyer, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller's corporate insurance department of
such claims, (ii) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, comply with
the terms of the applicable Retained Policy and (iii) each party shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the benefit of the applicable insurance coverage and shall pay, or shall cause
its Affiliate to pay, such benefit, if any, to Buyer (net of any Recovery
Costs 

incurred by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller as a result of the same);
provided that (A) Buyer shall be fully liable for all uninsured or self-
insured amounts in respect of any Retained Policy claims and (B) Buyer agrees
to reimburse Seller promptly upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs or expenses incurred by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller in connection
with making or pursuing any claim pursuant to this Section 7.02, including the
reasonable costs of filing a claim and any deductibles, premium increases,
Taxes or other amounts that are payable by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller
as a direct result of claims made pursuant to this Section 7.02 (such costs
and expenses referred to in this clause (b), "Recovery Costs"). The parties
agree that any recoveries under the Retained Policies pursuant to this Section
7.02 shall inure first to Seller to reimburse any and all Recovery Costs.

SECTION 7.03. Payments from Third Parties; Mail Handling. (a) In the event
that, on or after the Closing Date, either party shall (i) receive any
payments or other funds due to the other (including pursuant to the terms of
any of the Transaction Documents or any Shared Contract), then the party
receiving such funds shall promptly forward such funds to the proper party and
(ii) make a payment to any Person on behalf of the other party, then the party
on behalf of whom such payment was made agrees to promptly reimburse the party
making such payment. The parties acknowledge and agree there is no right of
offset regarding such payments and a party may not withhold funds received
from third parties for the account of the other party in the event there is a
dispute regarding any other issue under any of the Transaction Documents.

(b) Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, authorizes Seller and its Affiliates (and their respective
officers, directors, employees and agents), on the one hand, and Buyer and its
Affiliates (and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents),
on the other hand, as the case may be, if any such Person receives any mail,
package or other communication intended for another Party or such Party's
Affiliates or another Person and it is not readily apparent that such is the
case, to open such communications and to retain the same to the extent that
they relate to the business of the receiving Party. To the extent that any
such communications relate to the business of the non- receiving Party, the
receiving Party shall promptly deliver such mail, packages or other
communications (or, in case the same relate to both businesses, copies
thereof) to the other Party. No Party shall open mail unambiguously intended
for another Party and marked confidential or proprietary. The provisions of
this Section 7.03(b) are not intended to, and shall not be deemed to,
constitute an authorization by a Party to permit another Party to accept
service of process on its behalf, and no Party is or shall be deemed to be the
agent of another Party for service of process purposes.

SECTION 7.04. Ancillary Agreements. At the Closing, (a) Seller shall, and
shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, enter into, execute and deliver
the Assignment and Assumption Agreement in respect of the Transferred
Contracts, substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A (the "Assignment
and Assumption Agreement"), (b) Buyer and Seller shall enter into, execute and
deliver the Transition Services Agreement, substantially in the form attached
as Exhibit B (the "Transition Services Agreement"), (c) Buyer shall enter
into, execute and deliver the New Fox-RSN 

License Agreement, substantially identical to the form attached as Exhibit C
and (d) Buyer and Seller or its applicable Subsidiary shall enter into,
execute and deliver the RemainCo-RSN License Agreement, substantially
identical to the form attached as Exhibit D. Prior to the Closing, Buyer and
Seller shall negotiate in good faith with the other party and its
representatives in connection with finalizing each Exhibit (as defined in the
Transition Services Agreement).

SECTION 7.05. Separation Matters. Buyer hereby agrees that it will (a) comply
with the obligations set forth in the Separation Agreement and any Ancillary
Agreement (as defined in the Separation Agreement) applicable to the assets of
the Transferred Company and (b) comply with the provisions of the Specified
Sections (as defined in the Separation Agreement) and any applicable Ancillary
Agreements (as defined in the Separation Agreement) with respect to the assets
of the Transferred Company as if it were Remainco (as defined in the
Separation Agreement); provided that none of Buyer, the Transferred Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall have any obligations under the Tax Matters
Agreement (as defined in the Separation Agreement) or the Separation
Agreement, to the extent related to Taxes. Seller hereby agrees that it will
cause Fox to enforce its rights set forth in the Separation Agreement and any
Ancillary Agreement (as defined in the Separation Agreement) applicable to the
assets of the Transferred Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Business
(and, to the extent constituting Fox Liabilities (as defined in the Separation
Agreement), any Liabilities (as defined in the Separation Agreement) to which
any of them may become subject) at the direction of Buyer. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, if any Remainco Asset (as defined in the
Separation Agreement) that is an asset of the Transferred Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or the Business is transferred to Fox in accordance with
Section 5.05 of the Separation Agreement, Fox shall promptly procure the
transfer of such asset to Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer nominated by Buyer
(including the Transferred Company or any of its Subsidiaries) for no
additional consideration.

SECTION 7.06. Restrictive Covenants.

(a) From the date hereof and ending on the two-year anniversary of the Closing
Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives
(collectively, "Seller Restricted Parties") to, (i) maintain the
confidentiality of, (ii) not use, (iii) not divulge to any Person, any
confidential, non-public or proprietary information of the Transferred
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Business ("Business Confidential
Information"), except with the prior written consent of Buyer; provided that
such obligations shall not apply in respect of information that is or becomes
generally available to the public without breach of this Section 7.06 by any
Seller Restricted Party. If any Seller Restricted Party shall be required by
applicable Law to divulge any such information, such Seller Restricted Party
shall, to the extent legally permissible, provide Buyer with prompt written
notice of such request so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order
or other appropriate remedy, and such Seller Restricted Party shall, at the
request and expense of Buyer, cooperate with Buyer to the extent legally
permissible to obtain a protective order or other remedy; provided that, in
the event that a protective order or other remedy is not obtained, such Seller
Restricted Party may furnish only that portion of such information 

which, in the opinion of its counsel, is legally required to be disclosed and
shall, at the request and expense of Buyer, exercise its reasonable best
efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded any such information so disclosed. Nothing in or about this Agreement
prohibits any Seller Restricted Party from: (A) filing and, as provided for
under Section 21F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), maintaining the confidentiality of, a claim with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"); (B) providing Business
Confidential Information to the SEC, or providing the SEC with information
that would otherwise violate any part of this Agreement, to the extent
permitted by Section 21F of the Exchange Act; (C) cooperating, participating
or assisting in an SEC investigation or proceeding without notifying Seller,
Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates; or (D) receiving a monetary award
as set forth in Section 21F of the Exchange Act. Furthermore, the Seller
Restricted Parties shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any
federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of any Business
Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret to which the Defend
Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. Section 1833(b)) applies that is made (1) in
confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly
or indirectly, or to an attorney, in each case, solely for the purpose of
reporting or investigating a suspected violation of applicable law; or (2) in
a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or proceeding, if such
filings are made under seal.

(b) Promptly following the Closing, Seller shall (i) deliver, or cause to be
delivered, to Buyer all Business Confidential Information in the possession or
control of any Seller Restricted Party, and shall (ii) destroy, delete and
purge from its databases, files or other systems, or cause to be destroyed,
deleted or purged, all duplicate or back-up copies thereof and any notes,
extracts or summaries based thereon; provided, that (A) Seller shall be
entitled to retain any Business Confidential Information to the extent, in the
opinion of counsel, it is necessary to comply with applicable Law or in
connection with any legal Proceeding that seeks disclosure of any Business
Confidential Information and (B) Seller shall not be required to destroy or
purge ordinary course archives or backups to the extent such archives or
backups are made unreadable or inaccessible. Seller shall be responsible for
any breach of Sections 7.06(a) or (b) by any other Seller Restricted Party;
provided, further, that Seller shall not be required to take any action
pursuant to this Section 7.06(b) to the extent such action is inconsistent
with its obligations under the Separation Agreement.

(c) From the date hereof and ending on the twelve (12) month anniversary of
the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,

any Restricted Employee through a general advertisement or search firm that
does not target 

such Persons (ii) a former Restricted Employee whose employment with the
Transferred Company or its applicable Subsidiary ceased at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the start of such solicitation.

(d) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Section 7.06 were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
the parties hereto agree that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach
of this Section 7.06, Buyer shall be entitled to seek, as its sole remedy, an
injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach without the necessity
of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy. Seller hereby waives
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with
such remedy. Seller agrees that the only permitted objection that they may
raise in response to any action for equitable relief is that it contests the
existence of a breach or threatened breach of this Section 7.06.

(e) If, at the time of enforcement of any covenant contained in this Section
7.06, a court or other Governmental Entity shall hold that the duration or
scope stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the
parties hereto agree that the maximum duration or scope reasonable under such
circumstances shall be substituted for the stated duration or scope and that
the court or other Governmental Entity shall be allowed and directed to revise
the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum period and scope
permitted by applicable Law.

indemnification claim pursuant to clause (v), with its own counsel and at its
own expense.

resulting from, or relating to (i) the Business (other than in respect of
their obligations under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document) or

ARTICLE VIII 

Tax Matters

SECTION 8.01. Tax Treatment. The parties agree that, for U.S. Federal income
(and applicable state and local) tax purposes, the purchase and sale of the
Transferred Equity Interests shall be treated as a purchase and sale of all of
the assets held by the Transferred Company and its Disregarded Subsidiaries
and an assumption of all of the liabilities of the Transferred Company and its
Disregarded Subsidiaries. The parties shall report the transactions in a
manner consistent with such treatment and shall take no contrary position,
except as required by applicable Law. Buyer shall make commercially reasonable
efforts to have any Subsidiaries of the Transferred Company that are
partnerships for U.S. Federal income tax purposes use an interim closing of
the books for the partnership tax year that includes the Closing Date.

SECTION 8.02. Certain Tax Elections. Seller shall not, and shall cause the
Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries not to, take any action (including an
election pursuant to Treasury Regulations § 301.7701-3) to cause the
Transferred Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Corporate
Subsidiaries, following the LLC Conversion) to be treated as a corporation for
U.S. Federal income tax purposes.

SECTION 8.03. Allocation of Purchase Price. (a) No later than 150 days after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement allocating the
Purchase Price (increased by the amount of liabilities assumed by Buyer and
any other item properly taken into account for U.S. Federal income (and
applicable state and local) tax purposes) among the assets of the Transferred
Company and its Subsidiaries (as applicable) (the "Allocation Statement") in a
manner consistent with Sections 743, 755 and 1060 of the Code, as applicable.

(b) Seller shall deliver a written notice to Buyer within 30 days after
Seller's receipt of the Allocation Statement either accepting or objecting to
the Allocation Statement, and, if Seller shall not have delivered such written
notice within such 30-day period, Seller shall be deemed to have agreed to the
Allocation Statement, and the Allocation Statement shall become final and
binding upon the parties (the "Final Allocation"). If Seller objects to the
Allocation Statement in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence,
then Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith for a period of 30 days
after Buyer's receipt of Seller's written notice of objection to resolve their
differences, and, if the parties reach a resolution, the Allocation Statement
shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution and, as adjusted, shall become
the Final Allocation. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve their
differences within such 30-day period, then Seller and Buyer shall prepare
separate allocations, and there shall be no Final Allocation. 

(c) If a Final Allocation is agreed to or otherwise determined pursuant to
Section 8.03(b), then (i) the parties shall cooperate to adjust the Final
Allocation to reflect any adjustments made pursuant to Section 2.04, and (ii)
for U.S. Federal income (and applicable state and local) tax purposes, the
parties shall report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a
manner consistent with the Final Allocation and shall take no position
contrary thereto, except as required by applicable Law.

SECTION 8.04. Transfer Taxes. Buyer and Seller each shall bear fifty percent
(50%) of all Transfer Taxes. Buyer shall prepare and file all required Tax
Returns relating to Transfer Taxes and shall timely pay all Transfer Taxes.
Seller shall promptly reimburse Buyer for Seller's share of any such Transfer
Taxes. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer to minimize the amount of any
Transfer Taxes and, if necessary, shall cooperate with Buyer in the
preparation and filing of Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes. If Seller is
required by Law to pay any Transfer Taxes, Buyer shall promptly reimburse
Seller for Buyer's share therefor.

SECTION 8.05. Tax Cooperation, Information and Access. (a) Each party shall
cooperate with the other party and provide all assistance as the other party
may reasonably request, in each case, with respect to Tax matters.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.05(a), each party shall
deliver to the other party, as soon as practicable, such information and data
as the other party may reasonably request, and shall make available (at
mutually convenient times and locations) such knowledgeable employees and
shall permit (including by signing customary access letters and similar forms)
the other party to have reasonable access to such agents and advisors
(including accounting firms and legal counsel), in each case, as the other
party may reasonably request in order to enable the other party (i) to
complete and timely file all Tax Returns that may be required to be filed,
(ii) to respond to, prosecute or defend any audit or other examination by any
Governmental Entity with respect to Taxes and any administrative appeal,
alternative dispute resolution process or litigation with respect to Taxes and
(iii) to otherwise enable the other party to satisfy its accounting and Tax
requirements, including its customary internal Tax and accounting procedures
and applicable statutory audited financial statements processes, in each case,
with respect to the activities of the Transferred Company and any Subsidiary
of the Transferred Company. Any information obtained under this Agreement with
respect to Taxes shall be kept confidential, except as otherwise required in
connection with any of the actions or items described in the immediately
preceding sentence.

(c) Buyer shall retain all Tax records and information received in connection
with the Transactions until the later of the seventh anniversary of the filing
of the relevant Tax Return or the expiration of the relevant statute of
limitations for assessment and collection. Buyer shall provide Seller with
written notice at least sixty (60) days prior to destroying or disposing of
any such records and information and, if requested by Seller, instead deliver
any such records and information to Seller.

SECTION 8.06. Tax Sharing Agreements. Following the Closing, none of Buyer,
the Transferred Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be liable for any
Taxes of 

Seller, New Fox or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than the
Transferred Company or any of its Subsidiaries), including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Taxes reported on a Tax Return filed for a unitary, affiliated
or consolidated group of which any of the Seller, New Fox, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) is the common parent. Without limiting the foregoing, on or
before the Closing Date, the rights and obligations of the Transferred Company
and its Subsidiaries pursuant to all Tax allocation, sharing, indemnification
or similar agreements or arrangements (other than this Agreement) to which the
Transferred Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the
Seller, New Fox or any of their respective Subsidiaries, on the other hand,
are parties, shall terminate, and neither the Transferred Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or the Seller, New Fox or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall have any rights, obligations
or Liabilities thereunder after the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, none
of Seller, New Fox or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than the
Transferred Company or any of its Subsidiaries) shall be liable for Taxes
relating to the Business and imposed directly on the Transferred Company or
its Subsidiaries, such as payroll Taxes, sales and use Taxes, and similar
Taxes but any such Taxes that are current liabilities shall instead be
included in Adjusted Working Capital.

SECTION 8.07. Partnership Audits. (a) With respect to any Subsidiary of the
Transferred Company that is a partnership for U.S. Federal income tax
purposes, for all taxable periods that end on or before the Closing Date,
Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Seller, or
its designated representative, to be the "partnership representative" or "tax
matters partner", as applicable.

(b) With respect to any Subsidiary of the Transferred Company that is a
partnership for U.S. Federal income tax purposes (or applicable state or local
income tax purposes), for all taxable periods that end on or before or that
include the Closing Date and for which Seller is not either (x) the
"partnership representative" or "tax matters partner" for U.S. federal income
tax purposes or (y) any equivalent designation under applicable state or local
income tax law, then, for the jurisdiction in which Seller is not the
partnership representative, tax matters partner or equivalent designation:

(i) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the partnership
from electing to cause the BBA Rules to apply at any earlier date than is
required by applicable Law;

(ii) if a Governmental Entity proposes an adjustment to an item of income,
gain, loss, deduction or credit for any taxable period to which the BBA Rules
apply, Buyer shall (x) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
partnership to make any available modifications under the BBA Rules for
offsetting the economic burden of such adjustment, including by maximizing the
likelihood that the tax attributes of each partner are taken into account in
determining the adjustment and allocating the benefit of any such
modifications to the appropriate partner, (y) notify, or use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the partnership to notify, Seller of such
adjustment and shall send, or use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
partnership to send, Seller copies of 

all written communications from any Governmental Entity, in each case, within
five (5) business days of the partnership's receipt of such notice or
communications and (z) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
partnership not to make the election to "push out" any such adjustment to
Seller pursuant to Section 6226 of the Code if Seller, at its sole cost and
expense, (A) requests (in writing) that the partnership not make the election,
(B) timely deposits an amount with the partnership that is equal to the amount
of the tax that is attributable to Seller and (C) fully cooperates with Buyer
and the partnership to comply with the requirements of Section 6225(c)(2)(B)
of the Code; and

(iii) (x) Seller will have the right, at its own expense, directly or through
its designated representatives, to participate fully in any audit, including
the right to participate in any meetings or phone conferences with any
Governmental Entity, and (y) no audit or adjustment shall be settled, the
statute of limitations shall not be extended, no written communications shall
be made to any Governmental Entity, and no suit concerning any tax refund or
deficiency shall be filed, in each case, without the consent of Seller, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Section
8.07 shall survive the Closing and the termination of this Agreement.

ARTICLE IX 

Employees

SECTION 9.01. Transfer of Employees of the Business. On or prior to the
Closing, Seller shall take such steps as are required to (i) transfer the
employment of each Employee of the Business to the Transferred Company or one
of its Subsidiaries and (ii) transfer the employment of each employee who is
not an Employee of the Business from the Transferred Company or one of its
Subsidiaries to Seller or one of its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred
Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

SECTION 9.02. Compensation and Employee Benefits. (a) For the period
commencing at the Closing and ending on December 31, 2020 (the "Continuation
Period"), Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to each
Transferred Employee during his or her employment with Buyer and its
Affiliates (and, with respect to any compensation or benefits that apply
following a termination of employment, the applicable period thereafter) (i)
base salary or base wage rates that are no less favorable than those in effect
for each such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (ii)
target annual cash bonus opportunities and target long-term incentive
compensation opportunities that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
those in effect for each such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the
Closing, (iii) other compensation and benefits (including retirement benefits)
that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to those in effect for
similarly situated employees of Buyer Parent immediately prior to the Closing,
and (iv) severance benefits that are no less favorable than those provided to
similarly situated employees of Buyer immediately prior to the 

Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and its Affiliates shall assume
the obligation to provide and shall provide each Transferred Employee who is
eligible to receive severance benefits under the severance plans adopted by
Fox, as set forth on Section 9.02(a) of the Disclosure Letter (the "Fox
Severance Plan"), with the severance benefits provided under the Fox Severance
Plan in the event any such Transferred Employee receives or gives notice of a
qualifying termination on or prior to March 20, 2020 or otherwise becomes
entitled to receive severance benefits under the terms of the Fox Severance
Plan.

(b) Severance or Other Termination Liabilities. Buyer and its Affiliates shall
be solely responsible for any severance, redundancy or similar termination
payments or benefits that may become payable to any Transferred Employee that
directly relates to a termination of employment caused by Buyer or one of its
Affiliates that occurs on or following the Closing Date.

(c) Service Credit. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause
its Affiliates to, provide credit (without duplication) to each Transferred
Employee for his or her service recognized by Seller and its Affiliates and
their respective predecessors before the Closing for purposes of eligibility,
vesting, continuous service, determination of service awards, vacation, paid
time off and severance entitlements solely to the same extent and for the same
purposes as such service was credited under any similar Business Employee
Benefit Plan in which such Transferred Employee participated or was eligible
to participate immediately prior to the Closing; provided that such service
shall not be recognized for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan or retiree medical plan or to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or for purposes of any
frozen or discontinued Business Employee Benefit Plan or any frozen or
discontinued portion of a Business Employee Benefit Plan.

(d) Welfare Plans. Seller shall be responsible for all Liabilities related to
welfare benefit claims incurred as of the Closing under the Business Employee
Benefit Plans that are not Assumed Benefit Plans. Any former Employee of the
Business who has experienced a qualifying event under the U.S. Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as codified at Section 601 et seq.
of ERISA and at Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA") and his or her dependents
who are receiving benefits pursuant to COBRA under a Business Employee Benefit
Plan that is not an Assumed Benefit Plan as of the Closing shall be permitted
to continue receiving benefits pursuant to COBRA under such Business Employee
Benefit Plan following the Closing and none of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries) shall
have any Liabilities or obligations relating thereto. Buyer shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to provide that no pre-
existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods shall apply to Transferred
Employees under the benefit plans provided for those employees except to the
extent such condition or exclusion was applicable to an individual Transferred
Employee prior to the Closing. With respect to the plan year during which the
Closing occurs, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to provide each
Transferred Employee with credit for deductibles and out-of-pocket
requirements paid prior to the Closing in satisfying any applicable deductible
or 

out-of-pocket requirements under any employee benefit plan of Buyer or its
Affiliates in which such Transferred Employee is eligible to participate
following the Closing.

(e) Incentive Compensation. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
continue each performance period in effect at the Closing under each incentive
compensation bonus plan in which any Transferred Employee participates, with
appropriate adjustment (as reasonably determined by Buyer after consultation
with Seller) to the applicable performance targets to take into account the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, make any bonus payments earned by Transferred Employees under
any applicable incentive compensation bonus plan at the time prescribed by,
and in accordance with the other terms and conditions of, the applicable plan
as in effect immediately prior to the Closing, provided, that in no event
shall any Transferred Employee be eligible to receive any portion of his or
her bonus in respect of the fiscal year 2019 performance period that was
previously paid with respect to the period ending as of the date of the
Merger.

(f) Cash Retention Awards. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, assume and honor, in accordance with their terms, all
obligations with respect to each cash retention award granted to the
Transferred Employees and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing,
including forfeiture provisions, Tax withholding and reporting obligations
that arise in connection with the vesting and payment of each cash retention
award. Section 9.02(f) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete
list, as of the date of this Agreement, of all outstanding cash retention
awards held by Employees of the Business, including the amounts of each such
award on a holder by holder basis and the applicable vesting schedule.

(g) Vacation and Paid Leave. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates, to assume and honor all accrued but unused
vacation and other paid time-off of the Transferred Employees that are
properly accrued on the books and records of the Transferred Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing; provided that this covenant shall be subject
to the limitations with respect to using such accrued vacation as provided for
under the applicable plans and policies of Buyer and its Affiliates for
similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates, but in no event
shall any such accrued but unused vacation and other paid time-off be
forfeited to the extent it would not be forfeited in accordance with the
policies of Seller or the Company as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Seller and its Affiliates are
required under applicable Law to make a payment in settlement of accrued
vacation or paid time off of any Transferred Employee in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall reimburse Seller and
its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Company or any of its Subsidiaries)
for such payment no later than ten (10) business days following the date such
payment is actually made by Seller or its Affiliates.

(h) Business Employee Benefit Plans. From and after the Closing, the
Transferred Employees shall cease to be active participants in the Business
Employee Benefit Plans that are not Assumed Benefit Plans. 

SECTION 9.03. Assumed Benefit Plans. Buyer and its Affiliates shall assume all
assets and Liabilities related to all Assumed Benefit Plans.

SECTION 9.04. [Reserved]

SECTION 9.05. Multiemployer Plans.

(a) Buyer and its Affiliates shall be obligated to make contributions to each
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) to which
Seller or any of its Affiliates are required to contribute in respect of any
Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date (each, a
"Multiemployer Plan") in accordance with the applicable Collective Bargaining
Agreement relating thereto.(b) It is the intention of the Parties that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not result in a partial or
complete withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan, and Seller and Buyer and its
Affiliates shall cooperate to take all actions, if any, as may be necessary to
ensure the application of Section 4218 of ERISA to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and comply with any other applicable provisions
of ERISA in furtherance of the foregoing.

(b) Buyer shall provide Seller with reasonable advance notice of any action or
event that occurs before the end of the fifth calendar year commencing after
the Closing Date that would reasonably be expected to result in the imposition
of withdrawal liability under ERISA, and shall promptly furnish Seller with a
copy of any notice of withdrawal liability it may receive with respect to any
Multiemployer Plan, together with all the pertinent details. In the event that
any such withdrawal liability shall be assessed against Buyer or its
Affiliates, Buyer further agrees to provide Seller with reasonable advance
notice of any intention on the part of Buyer or its Affiliates not to make
full or any interim payment of any withdrawal liability when the same shall
become due.

(c) From and after the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates shall indemnify and
hold harmless Seller or any of its Affiliates for any Liabilities in respect
of any Multiemployer Plans, whether accrued prior to, at, or following the
Closing.

SECTION 9.06. Defined Contribution Plans. (a) Effective as of the Closing,
Buyer shall designate one or more defined contribution pension plans
(collectively, the "Buyer DC Plans") for the benefit of the Transferred
Employees who participated in one or more of the defined contribution pension
plans maintained by Fox or its Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller DC
Plans") that are intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
immediately prior to the Closing (collectively, the "Business DC Plans"). Such
Transferred Employees are referred to hereinafter as the "DC Employees". The
DC Employees shall be given credit under the respective Buyer DC Plan for all
service with Seller and its Affiliates and their respective predecessors as if
it were service with Buyer for purposes of determining eligibility and vesting
under each respective Buyer DC Plan, solely to the extent such service is
credited for the purposes of the applicable defined contribution plan in which
the Transferred Employee participated immediately prior to Closing. The
applicable Buyer DC Plans shall be tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code. 

(b) Each Buyer DC Plan will provide for the receipt in kind from the DC
Employees of "eligible rollover distributions" (as such term is defined under
Section 402 of the Code) other than distributions from Roth accounts in the
Seller DC Plans, including notes corresponding to loans (other than loans that
are fully or partially secured by amounts in Roth accounts in the Seller DC
Plans). Buyer and Seller will work together in order to facilitate any such
distribution or rollover and to effect an eligible rollover distribution for
those DC Employees who timely elect to rollover their account balances,
including notes, directly into a Buyer DC Plan.

SECTION 9.07. Equity Compensation. Each award of restricted stock units in
respect of shares of Disney Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Closing and held by a Transferred Employee (each, a "Seller RSU Award")
shall, as of the Closing and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into a deferred cash award of Buyer, with the same
vesting, forfeiture and payment terms and schedules as were applicable to such
Seller RSU Award immediately prior to the Closing, with each such Seller RSU
Award to be converted into a cash award with an economic value equal to such
Seller RSU Award calculated using the volume weighted average per-share price
of Disney Common Stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange as reported by
Bloomberg during the five (5) full trading days ending immediately prior to
the Closing Date. Section 9.07 of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list as of the date of this Agreement, of all outstanding Seller RSUs
Awards held by each Employee of the Business on a holder-by-holder basis,
including the number of shares of Disney Common Stock subject to each such
Seller RSU Award and the applicable vesting and payment schedule.

SECTION 9.08. Labor and Employment Law Matters. (a) Buyer and Seller shall,
and shall cause their applicable Affiliates to, cooperate to take all steps,
on a timely basis, as are required under applicable Law or any Collective
Bargaining Agreement to notify, consult with, or negotiate the effect, impact,
terms or timing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with each
union, labor board, employee group or Governmental Entity where so required
under applicable Law. Seller shall regularly review with Buyer the progress of
the notifications, consultations and negotiations with each union, labor
board, employee group and Governmental Entity regarding the effect, impact or
timing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer and Seller
shall, and shall cause their applicable Affiliates to, comply with all
applicable Laws, directives and regulations relating to the Employees of the
Business. To the extent that any of Seller or any of its Affiliates are,
immediately prior to the Closing, party to a Collective Bargaining Agreement
with respect to any Transferred Employee, Buyer or its applicable Affiliate
shall become a party to such Collective Bargaining Agreement and shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates to, be responsible for all Liabilities related to
periods after the Closing arising under any Collective Bargaining Agreement
with respect to any Transferred Employee. If required to become party to a
Collective Bargaining Agreement pursuant to the preceding sentence, Buyer
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, join any industrial, employer or
similar association or federation if membership is required for the currently
applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement to continue to apply. Buyer shall
indemnify Seller for any Liabilities incurred by Seller or its Affiliates with
respect to Buyer's material and uncured or uncurable 

noncompliance with the foregoing obligations, after the parties reasonably
cooperate to cure such noncompliance.

(b) Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its applicable Affiliates to, comply
with all applicable Laws, directives and regulations relating to the
Transferred Employees, including providing any required notice under the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended and any
similar state or local Law ("WARN"), with respect to events occurring on or
after the Closing. Seller shall, and shall cause each of their applicable
Affiliates to, comply with all applicable Laws, directives and regulations
relating to the Employees of the Business, including providing any required
notice under WARN, with respect to events occurring prior to the Closing.
Seller shall provide Buyer with all information relating to actions taken
prior to the Closing in order for Buyer and each of its applicable Affiliates
to comply with the applicable Laws, directive and regulations described above.

SECTION 9.09. Communications. Prior to the Closing, any broad-based employee
notices or communication materials (including website postings) from Buyer or
its Affiliates to the Employees of the Business with respect to employment,
compensation or benefits matters addressed in this Agreement or related,
directly or indirectly, to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
employment thereafter, shall be subject to the prior review and comment of
Seller and Fox, with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

SECTION 9.10. Third-Party Beneficiary Rights. This Article IX is included for
the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their respective
transferees and permitted assigns and does not and shall not create any right
in any Person, including any current or former employee of Seller, New Fox or
any of their respective Affiliates, any Employee of the Business or any former
Employee of the Business, who is not a party to this Agreement. Nothing
contained in this Agreement (express or implied) (a) is intended to create or
amend, or to require Buyer or its Affiliates to establish or maintain, any
employee benefit plan or arrangement or (b) is intended to confer upon any
individual any right to employment for any period of time, or any right to a
particular term or condition of employment. No current or former employee of
Seller, New Fox or any of their respective Affiliates, any Employee of the
Business or any former Employee of the Business, including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof, or any other Person not a party to this Agreement, shall be
entitled to assert any claim against Buyer, Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates under this Article IX.

ARTICLE X

any time prior to the Closing by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer.

SECTION 10.02. Buyer Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by Buyer at
any time prior to the Closing, if (a) Seller or the Selling Subsidiary shall
have 

breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or
failure to perform (i) would result in the failure of the conditions set forth
in Section 5.02(a) or 5.02(b) and (ii) is not capable of being cured by Seller
or the Selling Subsidiary by the Outside Date or, if capable of being cured,
shall not have been cured by Seller or the Selling Subsidiary on or before the
earlier of (x) the Outside Date and (y) the date that is thirty (30) calendar
days following Buyer's delivery of written notice to Seller of such breach or
failure to perform; (b) if any of the conditions set forth in Section 5.01
shall have become incapable of fulfillment; or (c) if the Closing shall not
have occurred on or before the Outside Date; provided, however, that Buyer may
only terminate this Agreement pursuant to (A) the preceding clause (a) if, at
the time of termination, Buyer is not in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement or (B) the preceding clauses (b) and (c) if Buyer's material breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement shall not have been the primary cause of the failure of the
conditions set forth in Section 5.01 or the failure of the Closing to have
occurred on or before the Outside Date, as applicable.

SECTION 10.03. Seller Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by Seller
at any time prior to the Closing, if (a) Buyer shall have breached or failed
to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)
would result in the failure of the conditions set forth in Section 5.03(a) or
5.03(b) and (ii) is not capable of being cured by Buyer by the Outside Date
or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured by Buyer on or before

calendar days following Seller's delivery of written notice to Buyer of such
breach or failure to perform; (b) if any of the conditions set forth in
Section 5.01 shall have become incapable of fulfillment; (c) if the Closing
shall not have occurred on or before the Outside Date; provided, however, that
Seller may only terminate this Agreement pursuant to (A) the preceding clause
(a) if, at the time of termination, Seller is not in material breach of any of
their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement or (B) the preceding clauses (b) and (c) if Seller's material breach
of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement shall not have been the primary cause of the failure of the
conditions set forth in Section 5.01 or the failure of the Closing to have
occurred on or before the Outside Date, as applicable; or (d) if (i) the
Marketing Period has ended and all the conditions set forth in Article V shall
have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, provided
that each such condition is capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to
occur at such time), (ii) Seller has irrevocably confirmed in writing that it
is prepared to effect the Closing pursuant to Section 2.01 and (iii) Buyer
fails to consummate the Closing within three business days following the later

2.01 and (y) receipt of the confirmation described in clause (ii); provided
that any termination of this Agreement by Buyer pursuant to Section 10.02(c)
shall be deemed a termination pursuant to this Section 10.03(d) if prior to
the time of such termination the conditions of clauses (i) and (ii) of this
Section 10.03(d) had been satisfied. 

SECTION 10.04. Effect of Termination. (a) If this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to this Article X, it will become void and of no further
force and effect, with no liability on the part of any party to this Agreement
(or any of their respective former, current or future general or limited
partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or
agents (collectively, the "Seller Related Parties" and the "Buyer Related
Parties", respectively)), except that the Parent Guarantee will survive in
accordance with its terms, the obligations in Section 6.04(b) with respect to
confidentiality and the provisions of this Section 10.04 and Article X will
survive any termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing
herein shall relieve any party from Liability incurred or suffered by any
other party as a result of any fraud, wilful misconduct or intentional breach
of any covenant contained in this Agreement.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 10.03(d),
then Buyer shall pay Seller a fee equal to $864,000,000 (the "Buyer
Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same-day funds no later than the second
business day following the date of such termination. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that the Buyer Termination Fee
is paid to, and accepted by, Seller in accordance with this Section 10.04(b),
the payment of such fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller
Related Parties against the Buyer Related Parties and the Financing Sources
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents,
the Financing and the Transactions, including any failure of the Closing to be
consummated, and the Buyer Related Parties and the Financing Sources shall not
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents, the Financing or the Transactions;
provided that, subject to Section 10.03(c), the foregoing shall not impair the
rights of Seller, if any, to obtain injunctive relief pursuant to Section
11.06(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall remain liable hereunder
for any reimbursement or indemnification obligations of Buyer under Section
6.05(g). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, upon payment of the
Buyer Termination Fee (plus any other amounts payable pursuant to Section
6.05(g)), neither Seller, nor any of the Seller Related Parties, nor any other
Person shall be entitled to seek or obtain any other damages of any kind
against Buyer or any Buyer Related Party or any Financing Source for, or with
respect to, or arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement, the
other Transaction Documents, the Financing or the Transactions (other than any
claim against Buyer as a result of any fraud, wilful misconduct or intentional
breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement occurring prior to
termination). In no event shall Buyer be required to pay the Buyer Termination
Fee on more than one occasion hereunder.

(c) In the event that the Buyer Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this
Section 10.04, Seller may, in its sole discretion: (i) seek specific
performance pursuant to Section 11.06(b), (ii) withdraw any claim for specific
performance and require payment of the Buyer Termination Fee by Buyer or (iii)
if Seller is unable for any reason to obtain specific performance, require
payment of the Buyer Termination Fee by Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt,
under no circumstances shall Seller be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance pursuant to Section 11.06(b) and payment of
monetary damages (including all or any portion of the Buyer Termination Fee). 

ARTICLE XI 

Miscellaneous

SECTION 11.01. No Reliance by Buyer; Own Due Diligence. Buyer is relying on
its own investigation, examination and valuation of the Business, the
Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries and the Transferred Equity Interests,
in effecting the transactions covered by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents. Buyer has made all inspections and investigations of
the Business and the Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries deemed necessary
or desirable by Buyer. Buyer is purchasing the Transferred Equity Interests
based on the results of its inspections and investigations, and not on any
representation or warranty of Seller or any of its Affiliates not expressly
set forth in this Agreement or in any other Transaction Document. In light of
these inspections and investigations and the representations and warranties
made to Buyer by Seller herein and therein, Buyer is relinquishing any right
to any claim based on any representations and warranties with respect to the
Transferred Company, its Subsidiaries or the Business, other than those
expressly set forth in this Agreement, any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto or the other Transaction Documents. Nothing in this Section 11.01 shall
limit any claim for fraud.

SECTION 11.02. Financial Information and Projections; No Other Representations
or Warranties. (a) In connection with Buyer's investigation of the Business,
Buyer has received from Seller various forward-looking statements regarding
the Business and the Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries (including the
estimates, assumptions, projections, forecasts and plans furnished to it) (the
"Forward-Looking Statements"). Buyer acknowledges and agrees (i) there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make the Forward-Looking Statements;
(ii) Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties; (iii) Buyer is taking full
responsibility for making its own investigation, examination and valuation of
the Business and has employed outside professionals to assist it with the
foregoing; (iv) Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all Forward-Looking Statements; (v)
Buyer is not relying on any Forward-Looking Statement in any manner
whatsoever; and (vi) with respect to the foregoing, except as set forth in
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, Buyer shall have no claim
against Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying any Forward-Looking Statement,
except as set forth in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

(c) Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to any Forward-
Looking Statement made (i) in the Management Presentation, (ii) in the Data
Room, (iii) in any supplemental due diligence information provided or made
available to Buyer, (iv) in connection with Buyer's discussions with
management of the Business, (v) in negotiations leading to this Agreement or
(vi) in any other circumstance, in each case, except as set forth in this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents. 

(d) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that except for the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement and in any other Transaction Document,
neither Seller nor the Transferred Company nor any other Person makes or shall
be deemed to make any express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to this Agreement, any other Transaction Document, the Business, the
Transferred Company and its Subsidiaries, the Transferred Equity Interests,
the Transactions or any other matter and any other representations and
warranties are hereby disclaimed. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that, except as set forth in this Agreement or
the other Transaction Documents, no representation or warranty has been made
or is being made as to merchantability, suitability or fitness for a
particular purpose, or quality, with respect to any tangible assets or as to
the condition or workmanship thereof or the absence of any defects therein,
whether latent or patent. Buyer agrees that the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents by Seller are
in lieu of, and Buyer hereby expressly waives all rights to, any implied
warranties that may otherwise be applicable because of the provisions of the
Uniform Commercial Code or any other statute, including the warranties of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

(e) Nothing in this Section 11.02 shall limit any claim for fraud.

SECTION 11.03. To the knowledge. "To the knowledge of Seller" or other
references to the knowledge or awareness of Seller or its Subsidiaries means
the actual knowledge, after due inquiry, of those individuals set forth in
Section 11.03 of the Disclosure Letter.

SECTION 11.04. Waivers. At any time and from time to time, any party to this
Agreement may (a) extend the time for, or waive in whole or in part, the
performance of any obligation of any party hereto under this Agreement, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in any representation, warranty or statement of any party
hereto or (c) waive any condition or compliance with any covenant contained in
this Agreement, in each case, in a written agreement signed by the parties to
be bound thereby.

SECTION 11.05. Modifications and Amendments. This Agreement shall not be
altered or otherwise amended except pursuant to an instrument in writing
executed and delivered by each of the parties hereto; provided that neither
Section 10.04(b), this Section 11.05, Section 11.04, Section 11.06 nor Section
11.12 shall be amended in a manner that is materially adverse to any Financing
Source without the written consent of such Financing Source.

SECTION 11.06. Assignability, Beneficiaries, Governing Law and Enforcement.
(a) This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective
successors and permitted assigns, but this Agreement shall not be assignable
by (i) Seller or the Selling Subsidiary without the prior written consent of
Buyer; or (ii) Buyer, without the prior written consent of Seller; provided
that, without such consent, (A) Seller may assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to an Affiliate at any time, or to a third party in connection with
a sale or transfer (by means of a merger, stock sale or 

otherwise) of all or substantially all of Seller's business; provided that no
such assignment shall relieve Seller of its obligations hereunder; and (B)
Buyer may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any of its Affiliate
or to any of its or their respective financing sources (including any agent or
other representative thereof) as collateral security for obligations in
respect of financing arrangements entered into in connection with the
Transaction (including, without limitation, the Financing) and any
refinancings, extensions, refundings or renewals thereof; provided that no
such assignment will relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder. Nothing
contained herein is intended to confer upon any Person, other than the parties
to this Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any
rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement; provided that (x) the
Financing Sources shall be express third-party beneficiaries of Section
10.04(b), Section 11.04, Section 11.05, this Section 11.06 and Section 11.12,
and each of such Sections shall expressly inure to the benefit of the
Financing Sources, each of which Financing Sources shall be entitled to rely
on and enforce the provisions of such Sections, and (y) the Company Released
Parties shall be express third-party beneficiaries of Section 6.11. This
Agreement shall be governed by the law of the State of New York without
reference to the choice of law doctrine of such state to the extent such
principles or rules would require or permit the application of Laws of another
jurisdiction.

(b) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law if any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
including the obligation to consummate the Transactions, without proof of
actual damages, this being in addition to any other remedy to which any party
is entitled at law or in equity. Each party further agrees that (i) no other
party hereto or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post
any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 11.06, and each party hereto
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument and (ii) it will not oppose
the granting of such remedy.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, it
is explicitly agreed that the right of Seller to obtain an injunction, or
other appropriate form of equitable relief, to cause, or to cause Buyer to
cause, the Equity Financing to be funded (but not the right of Seller to
obtain an injunction, or other appropriate form of equitable relief, for any
other reason) at any time shall be subject to the requirement that (i) Buyer
is required to complete the Closing pursuant to Sections 2.01 and 2.07, (ii)
the Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing or all conditions set forth in the Debt
Financing have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms
cannot be satisfied prior to the Closing, but subject to such conditions being
capable of being satisfied assuming the Closing occurs), (iii) Buyer fails to
complete the Closing in accordance with Sections 2.01 and 2.07 and (iv) Seller
has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if specific performance is granted
and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing
pursuant to Section 2.01 will occur. 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the Seller and
the Selling Subsidiary (in each case on behalf of itself, its controlled
Affiliates and its employees and representatives) acknowledges and agrees that
it (and such other Persons) shall have no recourse against the Financing
Sources, and the Financing Sources shall be subject to no Liabilities or
claims by the Seller or the Selling Subsidiary (or such other Persons) in
connection with any Financing or in any way relating to this Agreement, the
other Transaction Documents or any of the Transactions, whether at Law, in
equity, in Contract, in tort, or otherwise.

SECTION 11.07. Notices. Any notice, request, instruction or other
communication to be given hereunder by any party to another party shall be in

SECTION 11.08. Headings. The Article and Section headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning and interpretation of this Agreement.

SECTION 11.09. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which
shall be deemed to constitute the same Agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or e-mail shall
be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

SECTION 11.10. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits
and Schedules expressly contemplated hereby and attached hereto and the other
agreements and certificates delivered in connection herewith, including the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Disclosure Letter, contains the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the Transactions and supersedes
all prior agreements or understandings between the parties. Before signing
this Agreement the parties have had numerous conversations including
preliminary discussions, formal negotiations and informal conversations at
meals and social occasions, and have generated correspondence and other
writings, in which the parties discussed the transaction which is the subject
of this Agreement and their aspirations for success. In such conversations and
writings, individuals representing the parties may have expressed their
judgments and beliefs concerning the intentions, capabilities and practices of
the parties, and may have forecasted future events. The parties recognize that
such conversations and writings often involve an effort by both sides to be
positive and optimistic about the prospects for the transaction. However, it
is also recognized that all business transactions contain an element of risk,
as do the Transactions, and that it is normal business practice to limit the
legal obligations of contracting parties to only those promises and
representations which are essential to their transaction so as to provide
certainty as to their respective future rights and remedies. Accordingly,
other than the Confidentiality Agreement, the Transaction Documents are
intended to define the full extent of the legally enforceable undertakings and
representations of the parties hereto, and no promise or representation,
written or oral, which is not set forth explicitly in such agreements is
intended by either party to be legally binding. Each of the parties
acknowledge that in deciding to enter into this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and to consummate the transaction 

contemplated hereby and thereby, none of them has relied upon any statements
or representations, written or oral, other than those explicitly set forth
herein or therein. Nothing in this Section 11.10 shall limit any claim for
fraud.

SECTION 11.11. Payment of Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, all costs and expenses associated with this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents and the Transactions, including the fees of counsel and
accountants and fees relating to the Financing, shall be borne by the party
incurring such expenses.

SECTION 11.12. Consent to Jurisdiction; Waivers. (a) All actions and
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and
determined exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York. The parties hereto hereby (i) submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York for the purpose of any action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any party hereto and (ii) irrevocably waive, and agree
not to assert by way of motion, defense or otherwise, in any such action, any
claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named
court, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution,
that the action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
action is improper or that this Agreement or the transactions may not be
enforced in or by the above-named court.

(b) IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER, EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ITS
RIGHT TO TRIAL OF ANY ISSUE BY JURY.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.12 or otherwise provided
herein to the contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees (on behalf of
itself, its Subsidiaries and the equityholders, directors, officers,
employees, consultants, financial advisors, accountants, legal counsel,
investment bankers, and other agents, advisors and representatives of each of
them) that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in Law or
in equity, whether in Contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents
or the Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Financing or the performance thereof or the transactions
contemplated thereby, in any forum other than exclusively in the Supreme Court
of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts
thereof). EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL
RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT
OF ANY FINANCING OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY FINANCING SOURCE IN CONNECTION WITH THE
FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY
FINANCING SOURCE).

SECTION 11.13. Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this 

Agreement and any certificate delivered pursuant hereto by any Person shall
terminate at Closing or, except as provided in Section 10.04, upon the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01, 10.02 or 10.03, as
the case may be; provided that this Section 11.13 shall not limit any covenant
or agreement of the parties hereto which by its terms contemplates performance
as of or after the Closing or after termination of this Agreement. Following
the Closing, no party shall have any liability for any inaccuracy or breach of
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto. Nothing in this Section 11.13 shall
limit any claim for fraud.

SECTION 11.14. Fulfillment of Obligations. Any obligation of any party to any
other party under this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied or
fulfilled by an Affiliate of such party, shall be deemed to have been
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.

SECTION 11.15. Severability. It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto
that the provisions of this Agreement will be enforced to the fullest extent
permissible under the Laws in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is
sought. Accordingly, if any particular provision of this Agreement will be
determined to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be deemed
amended to delete therefrom the portion thus determined to be invalid or
unenforceable, such deletion to apply to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions hereof
only with respect to the operation of such provision in the particular
jurisdiction in which such determination is made.
