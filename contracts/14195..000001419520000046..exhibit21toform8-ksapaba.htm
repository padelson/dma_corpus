In making such calculation, the Independent Accountant shall consider only  (i) those items or amounts in the Post-Closing Statement, and the Buyer&#8217;s calculations of  Final Seller Net Working Capital, the Final Acquired Entity Net Working Capital, the  Final Acquired Entity Cash Equivalents and the Final Acquired Entity Indebtedness, as to  which Sellers have disagreed in its Dispute Notice, and in accordance with the definitions  as provided in this Agreement and not by independent review, (ii) a single written  submission (which submission shall be limited to the items in dispute set forth in the  Dispute Notice) submitted by each of Buyer and Sellers to the Independent Accountant  within ten (10) Business Days after the engagement thereof (a copy of which, upon  receipt of both submissions, the Independent Accountant shall forward to Buyer and  Sellers as applicable) and (iii) written responses submitted to the Independent Accountant  within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of each such presentation (copies of which,  upon receipt of both submissions, the Independent Accountant shall forward to Buyer and  Sellers, as applicable).  In resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accountant (i)  shall be bound by the provisions of this Section 2.6(e) and Section 2.6(f) and (ii) may not  assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greater value for such item claimed  by either Sellers or Buyer or less than the lower value for such item claimed by either  Sellers or Buyer. Sellers and Buyer shall direct the Independent Accountant to deliver to  Sellers and Buyer, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no later than forty (40)  days from the date of its engagement), a report setting forth such calculation.  Such report  shall be conclusive and binding on all Parties as the Final Closing Statement containing                                  34                               </FONT></DIV>

For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to   $1,000 and the Independent Accountant awards $600 in favor of Sellers position, sixty   percent (60%) of the costs of its review would be borne by Buyer and forty percent (40%)   of the costs would be borne by Sellers.

In determining the Final Purchase Price   allocation, no payment shall be treated for U.S. federal or other applicable income Tax   purposes as having been made to Buyer in exchange for the Buyer&#8217;s assumption of any   Liabilities or obligations hereunder under the principles of James M. Pierce Corp. v.   Commissioner, 326 F.2d 67 (8th Cir. 1964).  No later than ninety (90) calendar days after   the final determination of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.6, Buyer shall   deliver to Sellers an allocation of the Final Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities   (and all other relevant items) as of the Closing Date among the Acquired Assets and the   Acquired Equity Interests determined in a manner consistent with the Allocation   Principles for Sellers&#8217; review and comment, and Buyer shall similarly deliver any Section   338(g) Allocation as soon as practicable thereafter (together, and any portion thereof, the   &#8220;Purchase Price Allocation&#8221;).  If Sellers disagree with the Purchase Price Allocation,   Sellers shall notify Buyer in writing of such disagreement within thirty (30) calendar days   after the Buyer&#8217;s delivery of the Purchase Price Allocation, and any reasonable comments   timely provided by Sellers to Buyer under this Section 2.7 shall be considered by Buyer   in good faith.  Sellers and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such   disagreement and shall amend the Purchase Price Allocation to reflect any resolution   agreed to in writing.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any Acquired Asset or   Acquired Equity Interest for which an allocation of the Final Purchase Price is required   earlier than contemplated by the foregoing, the timeframe for determination of the   allocation of the Final Purchase Price to those assets shall be fixed by the Parties to   accommodate such requirement, provided that any such allocation may thereafter be   revised for other purposes as appropriate and necessary to reflect the overall final   Purchase Price Allocation.          (b)   The Buyer and Sellers shall work together in good faith to amend the  Purchase Price Allocation to the extent necessary to reflect any post-Closing adjustments  to the amount properly treated as consideration for the Acquired Assets and the Acquired  Equity Interests (as determined for U.S. federal income Tax purposes), in a manner  consistent with the Allocation Principles.         (c)   Any disagreement described in Section 2.7(a) or regarding any   amendment described in Section 2.7(b) that Buyer and Sellers are unable to resolve   through good faith negotiations within thirty (30) calendar days shall be submitted to the   Independent Accountant (acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator) for resolution.

The Parties hereto shall  reasonably cooperate to permit the preparation and timely filing of any such Tax Returns,  including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the application or imposition of any  such Transfer Taxes.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">            D.    Bidding Procedures.  The Debtors have articulated good and sufficient  business reasons for the Court to approve the Bidding Procedures.  The Bidding Procedures are   fair, reasonable, and appropriate under the circumstances and designed to maximize the recovery   on, and realizable value of, the Assets and the Equity Interests, as determined by the Debtors&#8217;   sound business judgment.  The Bidding Procedures were negotiated in good faith and at arms-  length and are reasonably designed to promote a competitive and robust bidding process to   generate the greatest level of interest in the Debtors&#8217; business resulting in the highest or   otherwise best offer.               E.    Designation of Stalking Horse Bid.  Selection of the Stalking Horse  Bidder as a &#8220;stalking horse&#8221; is in the best interest of the Debtors and the Debtors&#8217; estates, and   reflects a sound exercise of the Debtors&#8217; business judgment.  The Stalking Horse Agreement   provides the Debtors with the opportunity to sell the Assets and the Equity Interests to preserve   and realize their going concern value.  Without the Stalking Horse Bid, the Debtors would likely   realize a lower price for the Assets and the Equity Interests.  As such, the contributions of the   Stalking Horse Bidder to the process have indisputably provided a substantial benefit to the   Debtors, their estates, and creditors in these chapter 11 cases.  The Stalking Horse Bid will   provide the Debtors with the opportunity to secure a fair and adequate baseline price for the   Assets and the Equity Interests at the Auction, if any, and, accordingly, will provide a clear   benefit to the Debtors&#8217; estates, their creditors, and all other parties in interest.               F.    Designation of Stalking Horse Bidder.  The Stalking Horse Bidder shall  act as the &#8220;stalking horse bidder&#8221; pursuant to the Stalking Horse Agreement, and the Stalking   Horse Bid shall be subject to higher or better offers in accordance with the Bidding Procedures.   The Stalking Horse Bidder is not an &#8220;insider&#8221; or &#8220;affiliate&#8221; of any of the Debtors, as those terms   are defined in section 101 of the Bankruptcy Code, and no common identity of incorporators,                                         4 </FONT></DIV>

G.    Stalking Horse Bid Protections.  The Stalking Horse Bid Protections (as   defined in the Motion) (i) have been negotiated by the Stalking Horse Bidder and the Debtors    and their respective advisors at arms-length and in good faith and (ii) are necessary to ensure that    the Stalking Horse Bidder will continue to pursue its Stalking Horse Agreement and the Sale    Transaction contemplated thereby.  Subject to the Carve Out (as defined in the DIP Order4), the    Termination Payment and the Expense Reimbursement Payment (each as defined in the Stalking    Horse Agreement), to the extent payable under the Stalking Horse Agreement, (a)(i) are actual    and necessary costs and expenses of preserving the Debtors&#8217; estates within the meaning of    section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and (ii) shall be treated as allowed administrative expense    claims against the Debtors&#8217; estates pursuant to sections 105(a), 503(b), and 507(a)(2) of the    Bankruptcy Code; (b) are commensurate to the real and material benefits conferred upon the    Debtors&#8217; estates by the Stalking Horse Bidder; and (c) are fair, reasonable, and appropriate,    including in light of the size and nature of the Sale Transaction and the efforts that have been and    will be expended by the Stalking Horse Bidder.  The Stalking Horse Bid Protections are a    material inducement for, and condition of, the Stalking Horse Bidder&#8217;s execution of the Stalking    Horse Agreement.  Unless it is assured that the Stalking Horse Bid Protections will be available,    the Stalking Horse Bidder is unwilling to remain obligated to consummate the Stalking Horse    4 &#8220;DIP Order&#8221; means the applicable interim and final orders approving Debtors&#8217; Motion Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;   105, 361, 362, 363, 364, 507, and 552, Fed.

A Bid will  not be a Qualified Bid if it is materially less favorable than the terms of the Stalking Horse  Agreement.          The Debtors shall determine, in their reasonable judgment, in consultation with the   Consultation Parties, which of the Bids received by the Bid Deadline qualify as a &#8220;Qualified   Bid&#8221; (each Potential Bidder that submits such a Qualified Bid, a &#8220;Qualified Bidder&#8221;) and shall   notify each Qualified Bidder of its status as a Qualified Bidder by August 31, 2020, at 5:00 p.m.   (prevailing Central Time) (the &#8220;Qualified Bid Deadline&#8221;).  The Stalking Horse Bidder is a   Qualified Bidder and the Stalking Horse Bid (including as may be modified in favor of the   Debtors at the Auction (if any)) represents a Qualified Bid.          Without the written consent of the Debtors, in consultation with the Consultation Parties,   a Qualified Bidder may not modify, amend, or withdraw its Qualified Bid, except for proposed   amendments to increase the Purchase Price or otherwise improve the terms of its Qualified Bid   during the period that such Qualified Bid remains binding as specified herein; provided, that any   Qualified Bid may be improved at the Auction as set forth in these Bidding Procedures.  The   Debtors reserve the right to work with any Potential Bidder in advance of the Auction to cure   any deficiencies in a Bid that is not initially deemed a Qualified Bid and to clarify or otherwise   improve such Bid such that it may be designated a Qualified Bid.          In evaluating the Bids, the Debtors may take into consideration the following non- exhaustive factors:         1.    the amount and the form of consideration of the Purchase Price;        2.    the Assets, Equity Interests and liabilities included in or excluded from the Bid,             including any Contracts or other liabilities proposed to be assumed;                                          12 </FONT></DIV>

In addition, professionals and/or other representatives of   the Debtors and Consultation Parties shall be permitted to attend and observe the Auction.    Further, any creditor of the Debtors may attend and observe the Auction; provided that such   creditor provides the Debtors with written notice of its intention to attend the Auction on or   before one (1) business day prior to the Auction, which written notice shall be sent to proposed   counsel for the Debtors via electronic mail at Project.Badger.Weil@weil.com.             The Debtors may, in the exercise of their reasonable business judgment, adopt rules for   the Auction consistent with these Bidding Procedures and the Bidding Procedures Order that the   Debtors reasonably determine in consultation with the Consultation Parties to be appropriate to   promote a competitive Auction.

Escrow Agent shall not  be liable to any Party or other person for refraining from acting upon any instruction for or  related to the transfer or distribution of the Escrow Funds if delivered to any other electronic  mail (&#8220;email&#8221;) address of the Escrow Agent not set forth in Section 9, including but not limited  to a valid email address of any employee of Escrow Agent.

Escrow Agent hereby  undertakes to perform only those duties as are specifically and expressly provided herein, which  shall be deemed purely ministerial in nature, and no other duties, including but not limited to any   fiduciary duties, shall be implied, other than the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.   Escrow Agent has no knowledge of, nor any requirement to comply with, the terms and   conditions of any other agreement between the Parties, nor shall Escrow Agent be required to   determine if any Party has complied with any other agreement. Escrow Agent may rely upon,   and shall not be liable, for acting in accordance with any Joint Direction or Release Order   delivered to it by any Party in accordance with Section 9 and reasonably believed by Escrow   Agent to be genuine and to have been signed by an Authorized Representative(s), as applicable,   provided that Escrow Agent has fulfilled its obligations under Section 4(c) to confirm any funds   transfer instruction received in the name of Buyer or Seller. Escrow Agent shall be under no duty   to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such Joint Direction or   Release Order. Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be   taken by it in good faith except to the extent that Escrow Agent&#8217;s fraud, gross negligence or   willful misconduct was the cause of any direct loss to either Party. Escrow Agent may execute   any of its powers and perform any of its duties hereunder directly or through any of its affiliates   or agents, provided however that no such delegation of powers or duties will release Escrow   Agent from any of its obligations under this Agreement. In the event that Escrow Agent is   uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or receives instructions, claims or demands from any   Party that conflict with the provisions of this Agreement or conflicting instructions from the   Parties, Escrow Agent shall promptly notify the Parties of such uncertainty or apparent conflict   and, following delivery of such notice and until such time as the Parties deliver revised   instructions to Escrow Agent, Escrow Agent shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action   and shall not be liable for refraining to take any action, and its sole obligation shall be to keep   safely all property held in escrow until Escrow Agent shall be directed otherwise in a Joint   Direction or Release Order. Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any payments that may be   due to it or the Escrow Accounts, including, without limitation, the Escrow Amounts, nor shall  Escrow Agent have any duty or obligation to confirm or verify the accuracy or correctness of any  amounts deposited with it hereunder. To the extent practicable, the Parties agree to pursue any  redress or recourse in connection with any dispute (other than with respect to a dispute involving  Escrow Agent) without making Escrow Agent a party to the same. ANYTHING IN THIS  AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY NOTWITHSTANDING, IN NO EVENT SHALL  ESCROW AGENT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT  OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING  BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN  ADVISED OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE AND REGARDLESS OF  THE FORM OF ACTION. Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel of its selection in the  event of any dispute or question as to the meaning or construction of any of the provisions hereof  or its duties hereunder.  Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for or under, or chargeable with  knowledge of, the terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument or document  executed between/among the parties hereto, except as may be specifically provided in this  Agreement or in any Joint Direction or Release Order delivered to Escrow Agent hereunder. This  Agreement sets forth all of the obligations of Escrow Agent, and no additional obligations shall  be implied from the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document.                                            5 </FONT></DIV>

Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties or   obligations hereunder by giving thirty (30) calendar days&#8217; advance notice in writing of such   resignation to the Parties.  Escrow Agent&#8217;s sole responsibility after such fifteen (15) or thirty   (30)-day notice period (as applicable) expires, in the case of either removal or resignation, shall   be to hold and safeguard the Escrow Funds (without any obligation to reinvest the same) and to   deliver the same (a) to a designated substitute escrow agent, if any, appointed jointly by the   Parties, as set forth in a Joint Direction, (b) to such other Person jointly designated in writing by   the Parties, or (c) in accordance with the directions of a final court order, at which time of   delivery, Escrow Agent&#8217;s obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate, except for any liability   of the Escrow Agent arising out of its fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct.

Compensation.  The Escrow Agent acknowledges and agrees that the fees  and expenses described in Schedule 2 attached hereto are intended as full compensation for the   Escrow Agent&#8217;s services as contemplated by this Agreement and the Buyer agrees to pay to   Escrow Agent such fees and expenses upon execution of this Agreement.                 8.    Indemnification and Reimbursement.  The Parties shall jointly and  severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless Escrow Agent from and against any and all   losses, damages, liabilities and reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs or expenses   (including, without limitation, the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and reasonable   and documented out-of-pocket expenses of one outside counsel) (collectively, &#8220;Losses&#8221;), arising   out of or in connection with (a) Escrow Agent&#8217;s performance of this Agreement, except to the   extent that such Losses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction through a final order   to have been caused by the fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent,   and (b) Escrow Agent&#8217;s following any instructions or other directions from the Parties   (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any instructions or other directions set forth in a Joint   Direction or Release Order) received in accordance with this Agreement.

This Court has jurisdiction over this matter and over the property of the Debtors&#8217;   estates, including the Purchased Assets to be sold, transferred, or conveyed pursuant to the    Stalking Horse Agreement, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 157 and 1334.  This is a core proceeding   pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect; 157(b)(2).  The predicates for relief granted herein are sections 105, 363,   and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rules 2002, 6004, and 6006, and Local Rule 9013-  1. Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1408 and 1409.        B.    The legal and factual bases set forth in the Motion, at the Auction, and at the Sale  Hearing establish just cause for the relief granted herein.  Entry of this Sale Order is in the best   interests  of the Debtors and their respective estates, creditors, and all other parties in interest.         C.    The notice of the Motion, the Bidding Procedures, the selection of the Purchaser,  the Auction, the Sale Hearing, the Cure Costs (as defined in the Stalking Horse Agreement), and   the Sale Order was adequate and sufficient under the circumstances of these chapter 11 cases,   and such notice complied with all applicable requirements of the Bankruptcy Code, the   Bankruptcy Rules, and the Local Rules.  Accordingly, no further notice of the Motion, the   Bidding Procedures, the selection of the Purchaser, the Auction, the Sale Hearing, the Cure   Costs, or this  Sale Order is necessary  or required.         D.    The service of the Cure Notice was timely, good, sufficient, and appropriate under  the circumstances and no further notice need be given with respect to the Cure Costs for the   assumption and assignment of the Purchased Contracts.  All non-Debtor parties to the Purchased   Contracts have had a reasonable opportunity to object both to the Cure Costs listed on the Cure   Notice and to the assumption and assignment of the Purchased Contracts to Purchaser.   No   defaults exist in the Debtors&#8217; performance under the Purchased Contracts as of the date of this                                           4 </FONT></DIV>

Such compelling and sound business justification, which was set forth in the Motion, on   the record of the Bidding Procedures Hearing, on the record of the Auction, and on the record of   the Sale Hearing, is incorporated herein by reference and, among other things, forms the basis for   the findings  of fact and conclusions  of law as set forth herein.         F.    The Debtors&#8217; decision to enter into the Stalking Horse Agreement with the  Purchaser was a due and proper exercise of the Debtors&#8217; business judgment and was authorized   pursuant to the Bidding Procedures Order.  The Bid Protections contained in the Stalking Horse   Agreement (i) were necessary to preserve the value of the Debtors&#8217; estates by inducing the   Purchaser to enter into the Stalking Horse Agreement and (ii) are in compliance with the Bidding   Procedures and authorized  by the Bidding  Procedures Order.         G.

H.

Such business reasons include, but are   not limited to, that (i) the Stalking Horse Agreement and the closing of such agreement (the   &#8220;Closing&#8221;) will present the best opportunity to maximize and realize the value of the Purchased                                           6 </FONT></DIV>

I.    The Bidding Procedures set forth in the Bidding Procedures Order were  noncollusive and substantively and procedurally fair to all parties.         J.    The disclosures made by the Debtors in the Motion, the Sale Notice, and related  notices and documents filed with the Court concerning the Stalking Horse Agreement, the   Bidding Procedures Order, the Sale Hearing, and the Sale Transaction were good, complete, and   adequate.          K.    The Debtors and their professionals have complied, in good faith, in all respects   with the Bidding Procedures Order.  As demonstrated by any testimony and other evidence    proffered or adduced at the Sale Hearing and the representations of counsel made on the record    at the Sale Hearing, through marketing efforts and a competitive sale process and an auction    conducted in accordance with the Bidding Procedures Order, the Debtors (i) afforded interested    potential purchasers a full, fair, and reasonable opportunity to qualify as bidders and submit their    highest or otherwise best offer to purchase the Purchased Assets, (ii) provided potential    purchasers, upon request, sufficient information to enable them to make an informed judgment    on whether to bid on the Purchased Assets, and (iii) considered any bids submitted on or before   the Bid Deadline.  The Purchaser and its professionals have complied, in good faith, in all   respects with the Bidding Procedures Order.  The Bidding Procedures assisted in obtaining the   highest  or otherwise  best value for the Purchased Assets for the Debtors and their estates.                                           7 </FONT></DIV>

[Following the conclusion of the Auction,] the Debtors determined that the  Purchaser submitted the highest or otherwise best offer and selected the Purchaser as the   Successful Bidder for the Purchased Assets in accordance with the Bidding Procedures Order.    The offer of the Purchaser, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Stalking Horse   Agreement, including the form of and total consideration to be realized by the Debtors pursuant   to the Stalking Horse Agreement, (i) is the highest or otherwise best offer received by the   Debtors, (ii) is fair and reasonable, (iii) is in the best interests of the Debtors&#8217; estates, their   creditors, and other parties in interest, and (iv) constitutes full and adequate consideration and   reasonably equivalent value for the Purchased Assets.  The Debtors&#8217; determination that the   Stalking Horse Agreement constitutes the highest or otherwise best offer for the Purchased   Assets constitutes a valid and sound exercise of the Debtors&#8217; business judgment.  The Stalking   Horse Agreement and the Sale Transaction contemplated thereby represent a fair and reasonable   offer to purchase the Acquired Assets under the circumstances of these chapter 11 cases.  No   other entity or group of entities has offered to purchase the Acquired Assets for greater economic   value  to the Debtors&#8217; estates than the Purchaser.         M.    The Purchaser is not an &#8220;insider&#8221; or &#8220;affiliate&#8221; of the Debtors, as those terms are  defined in the section 101 of the Bankruptcy Code.  The Purchaser is a buyer in good faith, as   that term is used in the Bankruptcy Code and the decisions thereunder; the Stalking Horse   Agreement was negotiated and entered into in good faith, based upon arm&#8217;s length bargaining,   and without collusion or fraud of any kind; and neither the Debtors nor the Purchaser has   engaged in any conduct that would prevent the application of section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy   Code or cause the application of or implicate section 363(n) of the Bankruptcy Code to the   Stalking Horse Agreement or to the consummation of the Sale Transaction and transfer of the                                           8 </FONT></DIV>

N.

No consents or approvals, other    than as may be expressly provided for in the Stalking Horse Agreement, are required by the    Debtors to consummate such Sale Transaction.          O.    The Debtors have advanced sound business reasons for seeking to enter into the   Stalking Horse Agreement and to sell the Purchased Assets and assume and assign the Purchased   Contracts, as more fully set forth in the Motion and Snellenbarger Declaration and as   demonstrated at the Sale Hearing, and it is a reasonable exercise of the Debtors&#8217; business   judgment to sell the Purchased Assets and to consummate the Sale Transaction contemplated by   the Stalking Horse Agreement.  Notwithstanding any requirement for approval or consent by any   person, the transfer of the Purchased Assets to the Purchaser and the assumption and assignment   of the Purchased Contracts is a legal, valid, and effective transfer of the Purchased Assets,   including the Purchased Contracts.         P.

T.    The Debtors may sell the Purchased Assets free and clear of all Liens of any kind   or nature whatsoever (other than the Permitted Liens) because, in each case, one or more of the    standards set forth in section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code has been satisfied.  Those holders of    Liens from which the Purchased Assets are to be sold free and clear (including, to the extent   applicable, the non-Debtor parties to Purchased Contracts) who did not object, or who withdrew   their objections, to the sale of the Purchased Assets and the Motion are deemed to have   consented pursuant to section 363(f)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code.

Not selling the Purchased Assets free and clear of all Liens (other than the  Permitted Liens) would adversely impact the Debtors&#8217; estates, and any Sale Transaction of the   Purchased Assets other than one free and clear of all Liens (other than the Permitted Liens)   would be of substantially less value to the Debtors&#8217; estates.

V.    The Debtors and the Purchaser have, to the extent necessary, satisfied the   requirements of section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, including sections 365(b)(1)(A), (B), and    365(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, in connection with the Sale Transaction and the assumption and    assignment of the Purchased Contracts.  The Purchaser has demonstrated adequate assurance of    future performance with respect to all Purchased Contracts pursuant to section 365(b)(1)(C) of    the Bankruptcy Code.  The assumption and assignment of the Purchased Contracts pursuant to   the terms of this Sale Order is integral to the Stalking Horse Agreement and is in the best   interests of the Debtors, their estates, their creditors, and other parties in interest, and represents   the exercise of sound and prudent business  judgment  by the Debtors.

Y.    The Sale Transaction contemplated pursuant to the Stalking Horse Agreement   does not amount to a consolidation, merger or de facto merger of the Purchaser and the Debtors    or the Debtors&#8217; estates, there is not substantial continuity between the Purchaser and the Debtors,    there is no common identity between the Debtors and the Purchaser, there is no continuity of    enterprise between the Debtors and the Purchaser, the Purchaser is not a mere continuation of the    Debtors or their estates, and the Purchaser does not constitute a successor to the Debtors or their    estates.          Z.    The sale of the Purchased Assets outside of a chapter 11 plan pursuant to the  Stalking Horse Agreement neither impermissibly restructures the rights of the Debtors&#8217; creditors   nor impermissibly dictates the terms of a liquidating plan of reorganization for the Debtors.  The    sale does not constitute  a sub rosa chapter 11 plan.          AA.   The Stalking Horse Agreement was not entered into, and none of the Debtors or    the Purchaser have entered into the Stalking Horse Agreement or proposed to consummate the    Sale Transaction contemplated thereby, for the purpose of hindering, delaying, or defrauding the   Debtors&#8217; present or future creditors.

Accordingly, there is cause to determine inapplicable the stays contemplated by Bankruptcy   Rules  6004 and 6006.         CC.   The Purchaser has not agreed to assume and shall have no obligation with respect  to any liabilities of the Debtors or their subsidiaries or affiliates other than as expressly set forth   in the Stalking Horse Agreement.  Other than the Assumed Liabilities, and except as expressly   provided for by the terms of the Stalking Horse Agreement, the Purchaser shall have no   obligations with respect to any Excluded Liabilities and shall acquire all the Purchased Assets   free and clear of the Excluded Liabilities.         DD.   The Debtors, in connection with offering products or services, did not disclose  any policy prohibiting the transfer of personally identifiable information and, therefore, the sale   of the Purchased Assets may be approved pursuant to section 363(b)(1)(A) of the Bankruptcy   Code without the appointment of a consumer privacy ombudsman, as defined in section 332 of   the Bankruptcy Code.

Each of the Parties irrevocably and        unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue in, and any defense of        inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any Litigation so brought and waives any        bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other Party with respect        thereto.  Any Party may make service on any other Party by sending or delivering a copy        of the process to the Party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the        giving of notices in Section  13.1; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 13.7        shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by        Law or in equity.

The Parties intend that all foreign jurisdictions will enforce any        Decree of the Bankruptcy Court in any Litigation arising out of or relating to this       Agreement or any Related Agreement or the Transactions.   13.8  Specific Performance.  Service Provider acknowledges and agrees that Service Recipient        and their respective estates would be damaged irreparably in the event Service Provider        does not perform its obligations under this Agreement in accordance with its specific        terms or otherwise breaches this Agreement, so that, in addition to any other remedy that        Service Recipient may have under Law or equity, each Service Recipient shall be        entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to injunctive relief        to prevent any breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically        this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof.   13.9  Force Majeure.  Continued performance of any Service may be suspended immediately        by Service Provider to the extent made impossible by any event or condition beyond the        reasonable control of Service Provider, including acts of God, fire, flood, labor or trade        disturbance, war, riots, civil commotion,  pandemic, compliance in good faith with the        requirements of any applicable Law or order of any Governmental Authority (whether or        not it later proves to be invalid), unavailability of materials, or other event or condition        whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing (a &#8220;Force Majeure Event&#8221;).         Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, Service        Provider may, without any required prior written notice, suspend the performance of any        or all of the Services it provides if made impossible by a Force Majeure Event.  Service        Provider shall give prompt notice to Recipient of the occurrence of a Force Majeure        Event giving rise to any suspension of a Service and of the nature and anticipated        duration of such Force Majeure Event, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to        cure the cause of such suspension promptly, the cost of such efforts to be borne equally        by Service Provider and Service Recipient, it being understood, however, that labor        disputes shall be a continuing cause of suspension, and settlement of the same shall be        entirely within the discretion of Service Provider.  Upon the occurrence of a Force        Majeure Event, the Parties shall cooperate with each other to find reasonable alternative        commercial means and methods for the provision of the suspended Service, if reasonably        necessary. </FONT></DIV>
