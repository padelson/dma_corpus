material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and Parent and
Purchaser agree to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed
with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable Law. The Company and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer
Documents before they are filed with the SEC or disseminated to holders of
Shares, and Parent and Purchaser shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company
and its

 



13  counsel. In addition, Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its
counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall provide them a written
summary of any oral comments, that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel receive
from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or
the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written
or oral responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review any such responses, and Parent and Purchaser
shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel.

 

Section 2.2 _Company Action_.

 

(a) On the date the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC
or as soon as practicable (but in any event no later than one (1) Business
Day) thereafter, the Company shall, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ") that, subject to and without limiting the rights of the
Company Board to effect a Change in Recommendation in accordance with _Section
8.3_, contain the Company Board Recommendation. The Company shall also
include, and represents and warrants that it has obtained all necessary
consents of the Financial Advisor to include, in the Schedule 14D-9 the
Financial Advisor Opinion in its entirety and a summary of the financial
analysis conducted by the Financial Advisor. The Schedule 14D-9 shall comply
in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act.
The Company agrees to cause copies of the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated
to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act;
_provided_ , _however_ , that at the Companys request, Parent and Purchaser
shall, at their own expense, disseminate any such Schedule 14D-9 required to
be disseminated to holders of Common Shares, subject to the availability of
the Schedule 14D-9 at the time Parent and Purchaser intend to disseminate the
Offer Documents. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to cause the Schedule
14D-9 to be mailed or otherwise disseminated to the holders of Shares
together with the Offer Documents disseminated to the holders of Shares. The
Company, Parent and Purchaser agree to promptly correct any information
provided by such Party for use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company agrees to
cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and
copies thereof disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Law. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it
is filed with the SEC or disseminated to holders of Shares, and the Company
shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel. In addition, the
Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any
written comments, and shall provide them a written summary of any oral
comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after
receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
any such responses, and the Company shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel.

 



14 (b) Promptly after the date hereof (and in any event in sufficient time to
permit Purchaser to commence the Offer in a timely manner) and otherwise from
time to time as Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to
the Companys stockholders, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished
to Purchaser, to the extent reasonably available to the Company, mailing
labels, security position listings, non-objecting beneficial owner lists and
any other listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of the
record or beneficial owners of the Shares as of the most recent practicable
date, and shall promptly furnish Purchaser with such information (including,
to the extent reasonably available to the Company, updated lists of holders of
the Shares and their addresses, mailing labels, security position listings
and non-objecting beneficial owner lists). The Company shall provide such
other assistance as Purchaser or its agents may reasonably request in
communicating with the record and beneficial owners of Shares, in connection
with the preparation and dissemination of the Schedule TO and the Offer
Documents and the solicitation of tenders of Shares in the Offer. Subject to
the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary
to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and
Purchaser shall keep confidential and not disclose the information contained
in any such labels, lists, listings and files, in each case as required by
the Confidentiality Agreement, shall use any such information only in
connection with the Transactions pursuant to this Agreement and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the Company or
destroy all copies of such information then in their possession or control in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) To the extent permissible under applicable Law, the Company Board shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take any action necessary to cause any
Common Shares reserved for or otherwise subject to issuance (i) upon the
exercise of outstanding Company Options to be canceled upon the Acceptance
Time pursuant to _Section 4.4(a)_, (ii) pursuant to the settlement of
outstanding Company RSUs to be canceled upon the Acceptance Time pursuant to
_Section 4.4(b) _and (iii) otherwise reserved for issuance pursuant to the
Company Equity Plans, to be not so reserved or subject to issuance at and
after the Acceptance Time.

 

(d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to register (and shall
instruct its transfer agent to register) the transfer of Shares accepted for
payment by Purchaser effective immediately after the Acceptance Time.

Section 2.3 _Directors_.

 

(a) Promptly upon the purchase by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer of such
number of Shares as shall satisfy the Minimum Condition, and from time to
time thereafter, subject to applicable Law and Securities Exchange Rules,
Purchaser shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up
to the next whole number, on the Company Board as shall give Purchaser
representation on the Company Board equal to the product of the total number
of directors on the Company Board (after giving effect to any increase in the
number of directors pursuant to this _Section 2.3_) and the percentage that
such number of Shares so purchased (including Shares accepted for payment)
bears to the total number of Shares outstanding, and the Company shall, upon
request by Purchaser, promptly increase the size of the Company Board or use
its reasonable best efforts to secure the resignations of such number of
directors as is necessary to provide Purchaser with such level of
representation and shall cause Purchasers

 



15  designees to be so elected or appointed. Subject to subsection (c) of this
_Section 2.3_ and applicable Law and Securities Exchange Rules, the Company
shall, to the extent requested by Parent, also cause individuals so
designated to constitute the same percentage as such individuals represent of
the entire Company Board (but no less than a majority) on the following: (i)
each committee of the Company Board; (ii) each board of directors and each
committee thereof of each wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company; and (iii)
the designees, appointees or other similar representatives of the Company on
each board of directors (or other similar governing body) and each committee
thereof of each non-wholly owned Subsidiary. The Companys obligations to
appoint designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act. At the request of Purchaser, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to effect any such election or appointment of Purchasers
designees, including mailing to its stockholders the information required by
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder,
which shall be so mailed together with a copy of the Schedule 14D-9. Parent
and Purchaser shall furnish to the Company all information with respect to the
designees and themselves and their respective officers, directors and
Affiliates, in each case required by such section and rule.

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, so long as there shall be at least one
director of the Company on the Company Board who is (i) an individual serving
as a director of the Company from and after the date hereof or (ii) an
individual becoming a director of the Company after the date hereof whose
election, or nomination for election by the Companys stockholders, was
approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors described in clause
(i) or this clause (ii) then comprising the Company Board other than a
designee of Parent or Purchaser (a " _Continuing Director_ "), any amendment
or termination of this Agreement requiring action by the Company Board, any
extension of time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of Parent or Purchaser under this Agreement and any waiver of compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions under this Agreement for the benefit of
the Company, any exercise of the Companys rights or remedies under this
Agreement or any other action by the Company Board with respect to the
Transactions if such action could reasonably be expected to adversely affect
any holders of Shares other than Parent, Purchaser or their Subsidiaries,
shall require authorization by a majority of the Continuing Directors (or
of the sole Continuing Director if there shall then be only one Continuing
Director).

(c) In the event that Purchasers designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_, until the Effective Time, each
committee of the Company Board that is required by applicable Securities
Exchange Rules or Law to be comprised solely of, or a majority of, Continuing
Directors shall be so comprised; _provided_ , _however_ , that in such event,
if the number of Continuing Directors shall be reduced below the number of
directors as may be required by such rules or securities Laws for any reason
whatsoever or the Continuing Directors shall not satisfy other requirements of
applicable Securities Exchange Rules or Law, the remaining Continuing Director
or Continuing Directors shall be entitled to designate individuals meeting
the foregoing criteria to fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be
Continuing Directors for purposes of this _Section 2.3(c)_ or, if no other
Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall designate such
number of directors as may be required by applicable Securities Exchange
Rules and Law to fill such vacancies, which directors shall be deemed to be
Continuing Directors for purposes of this _Section 2.3(c)_.

 



16 Section 2.4 _Top-Up Option_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 2.4(b)_ and _(c)_ , the Company grants to Parent and
Purchaser an option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase from the Company
the number of Common Shares equal to the lesser of (i) the lowest number of
Common Shares that, when added to the number of Common Shares owned by Parent
and Purchaser at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option ( _provided_ ,
that Parent, Purchaser and their respective Subsidiaries shall not be deemed
to own, directly or indirectly, Common Shares issuable upon conversion of the
Series A Preferred Stock to be purchased by Purchaser pursuant to the Series
A Purchase Agreement), constitutes at least ninety percent (90%) of the number
of Common Shares that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of
all Common Shares subject to the Top-Up Option, or (ii) the aggregate number
of Common Shares that the Company is authorized to issue under the Company
Charter but that are not outstanding and not reserved or otherwise committed
to be issued (as such terms are used in the DGCL) at the time of exercise of
the Top-Up Option. The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only once, in whole
but not in part.

(b) At any time at or after the Acceptance Time, the Top-Up Option may
subsequently be exercised by Parent or Purchaser, or at any time at or after
the Series A Share Purchase, upon written request, of the Company (in
accordance with this _Section 2.4_) shall be exercised by Parent or
Purchaser. Upon Parents request, the Company shall cause its transfer agent
to certify in writing to Parent the number of Common Shares issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and
after giving effect to the issuance of the maximum number of Common Shares
available pursuant to the Top-Up Option. The aggregate purchase price payable
for the Common Shares being purchased by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to the
Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of such shares by
the Offer Price. Such purchase price shall be paid by Parent or Purchaser (i)
in cash equal to the aggregate par value of such Common Shares (the " _Top-Up
Par Value Payment_ ") and (ii) by executing and delivering to the Company a
promissory note having a principal amount equal to the balance of such
purchase price. Any such promissory note shall be full recourse to Purchaser,
shall be guaranteed by Parent, shall bear interest at the rate of three
percent (3%) per annum, shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of
execution and delivery of such promissory note and may be prepaid without
premium or penalty.

 

(c) In the event Parent or Purchaser wishes or is required to exercise the
Top-Up Option, Parent or Purchaser shall deliver to the Company a notice
setting forth (i) the number of Common Shares that Parent or Purchaser intends
to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option and (ii) the place and time at which
the closing of the purchase of such Common Shares by Parent or Purchaser is
to take place. In the event the Company wishes that Parent or Purchaser
exercise the Top-Up Option, the Company shall deliver to Parent and Purchaser
a written notice setting forth (A) the number of Common Shares to be purchased
by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to the Top-Up Option, and (B) the place and
time at which the closing of the purchase of such Common Shares by Parent or
Purchaser is to take place. At the closing of the purchase of such Common
Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, Parent or Purchaser
shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration required to be
delivered in exchange for such shares, and the Company shall cause to be
issued to Parent or Purchaser (as the case may be) a certificate representing
such shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent
and Purchaser shall not be entitled or required to exercise the Top-Up Option,
and

 



17  the Company shall not be obligated to issue shares in respect thereof, (x)
if any Law shall prohibit or make illegal the exercise of the Top-Up Option or
the issuance of Common Shares pursuant thereto or (y) Parent and Purchaser,
directly or indirectly, own Common Shares and Series A Preferred Shares
representing less than a majority of the voting power of the outstanding
Common Shares and Series A Preferred Shares.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in any appraisal
proceeding under Section 262 of the DGCL, the exercise of the Top-Up Option,
the issuance of the Common Shares pursuant thereto, the delivery by Purchaser
of cash or the promissory note in payment for such Common Shares and the other
transactions contemplated in connection with the exercise of the Top-
Up Option shall not be considered in connection with the determination of the
fair value of any Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL.

 

ARTICLE III

_THE MERGER_

Section 3.1 _The Merger._

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Purchaser shall be

corporate existence of Purchaser shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Company_ "). The
Merger shall be effected as soon as practicable following the consummation of
the Offer, the Series A Share Purchase and, if applicable, the exercise of the
Top-Up Option. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at
the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises of the Company and Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving
Company, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and
Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Company.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, the Company Charter shall become the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Company, until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law, subject to _Section 8.5(a)_.
Subject to _Section 8.5(a)_, promptly following the Effective Time, the
Company Bylaws, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
be amended and restated in their entirety to read as the bylaws of Purchaser
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all references
therein to Purchaser shall be references to the Surviving Company,
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

(c) The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the Surviving
Company, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company until their respective
successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal. The officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time,
shall continue as the officers of the Surviving Company, each to hold office
in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Company until their respective successors shall have been duly
appointed, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. 

 



18 (d) If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving Company shall
determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills
of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Company its right, title or interest in,
to or under any of the assets of either of the Company or Purchaser acquired
or to be acquired by the Surviving Company as a result of, or in connection
with, the Transactions, then the officers and directors of the Surviving
Company shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf
of either the Company or Purchaser, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments
of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions
and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any
and all right, title or interest in, to or under such assets in the Surviving
Company or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

in writing by the Parties; _provided_ that, in any event, the Merger shall be
effected as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer and,
if applicable, exercise of the Top-Up Option. The date on which the Closing
occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date". As part of the Closing,
Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall cause an appropriate certificate of
merger (or, if applicable, a certificate of ownership and merger) (in either
case, the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time the
Certificate of Merger shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware or such later date and time agreed upon by the
Parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger, such date and time
hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ".

 

ARTICLE IV

 

 _TREATMENT OF EQUITY_

 

Section 4.1 _Conversion of Shares_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Common Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Common Shares to
be cancelled pursuant to _Section 4.1(c)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, payable to the
holder thereof, without any interest thereon, equal to the Offer Price (the "
_Common Stock Merger Consideration_ "), subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 4.5_.

 



19 (b) Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Purchaser issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Company.

 

(c) All shares of Company Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock that are
owned by the Company as treasury stock and Common Shares and Series A
Preferred Shares that are owned by Parent, Purchaser or any other direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall, at the Effective Time, be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(d) At the Effective Time, each Common Share converted into the right to
receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_
shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders
immediately prior to the Effective Time of such Shares not represented by
certificates (" _Common Book Entry Shares_ ") and the holders of certificates
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented such Shares (the "
_Common Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such Shares other than the right to receive, upon transfer of such Common
Book Entry Shares or delivery of such Common Certificates in accordance with
_Section 4.2_, the Common Stock Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, for each such Share held by them.

(e) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time and subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section 7.1_), the
outstanding Common Shares or Series A Preferred Shares are changed into a
different number or class or series of shares by reason of any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, or an issuance of Common Shares or Series A Preferred Shares upon
the exercise or exchange of Rights following a Triggering Event (as defined
in the Rights Agreement) occurs, then the Offer Price (as well as the Merger
Consideration) shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 

(f) At the Effective Time, each share of Series A Preferred Stock (the "
_Series A Preferred Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Series A Preferred Shares to be cancelled
pursuant to _Section 4.1(c)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash, payable to the holder thereof,
without any interest thereon, equal to $77.30 (the " _Series A Merger
Consideration_ " and, together with the Common Stock Merger Consideration,
the " _Merger Consideration_ "), subject to any withholding of Taxes required
by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 4.5_. At the Effective Time,
each Series A Preferred Share converted into the right to receive the
Series A Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 4.1(f)_ shall be
automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders immediately
prior to the Effective Time of such Series A Preferred Shares not represented
by certificates (" _Series A Book Entry Shares_ " and, together with the
Common Book Entry Share, the " _Book Entry Shares_ ") and the holders of
certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented such
Series A Preferred Shares (the " _Series A Certificates_ " and, together with
the Common Certificates, the " _Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Series A Preferred Shares other than the right
to receive, upon transfer of such Series A Book Entry Shares or delivery of
such Series A Certificates in accordance with _Section 4.2_, the Series A
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, for each such Share held
by them.

 



20 Section 4.2 _Exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Shares_.

 

(a) At the Closing and immediately following the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, Parent shall
deliver, in trust, to American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC, or such
other paying agent as agreed to in writing by the Parties (the " _Paying
Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Common Shares and Series A
Preferred Shares at the Effective Time, sufficient funds for timely payment of
the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration contemplated by _Section 4.1(a)_ and
_Section 4.1(f)_ (including with respect to former Dissenting Shares held by
stockholders of the Company who shall have failed to perfect or who shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL), Parent shall promptly
deliver, or cause to be delivered, additional funds to the Paying Agent in an
amount that is equal to the deficiency required to make such payments.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent
to mail to each holder of record of Certificates or Book Entry Shares not
held through The Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") whose Common Shares or
Series A Preferred Shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_ or _Section 4.1(f)_, as
applicable: (i) a letter of transmittal, in customary form, that shall specify
that delivery of such Certificates or transfer of such Book Entry Shares
shall be deemed to have occurred, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or such Book Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
transfer of such Book Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of such
Book Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration, the
form and substance of which letter of transmittal and instructions shall be
substantially as reasonably agreed to by the Company and Parent and prepared
prior to the Closing. Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent
in connection with the transfer of a Book Entry Share not held through DTC or
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, in each case
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and with such other documents as
may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Book Entry
Share or Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
subject to any required withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this _ARTICLE IV_ , and such Book Entry Share
so transferred or Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid to holders of Book Entry Shares or Certificates in
connection with, or accrued on, the Merger Consideration. If any Merger
Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than a Person in whose name the
Book Entry Share transferred or Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor
is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Book Entry Share transferred
or Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. With
respect to Book Entry Shares held through DTC, which Book Entry Shares were
converted 

 



21  into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
4.1(a)_ or _Section 4.1(f)_, as applicable, the holder of such Book Entry
Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter
of transmittal.

(c) The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by Parent or the Surviving Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States government
with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United
States government and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States government. Earnings on the Exchange Fund in excess of the amounts
payable to the Company stockholders shall be the sole and exclusive property
of Parent and the Surviving Company and shall be paid to Parent or the
Surviving Company as Parent directs. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall
relieve Parent, the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent from promptly making
the payments required by this _ARTICLE IV_ , and following any losses from
any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional cash funds to
the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Common Shares and Series A
Preferred Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in the amount
of such losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the
Exchange Fund.

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _ARTICLE IV_ , except as otherwise provided by
Law.

 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the
Company one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Company. Any holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares who have
not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE IV_ with respect to such
Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Company for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect
thereof.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any Party
shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book Entry Share shall not have
been surrendered or transferred prior to the date on which any Merger
Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate or Book Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit to be in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent) by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if requested by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount, upon such terms as
reasonably requested by Parent, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made

 



22  against Parent or the Surviving Company with respect to such Certificate,
the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration to which such Person is entitled in
respect of such Certificate pursuant to this _ARTICLE IV_.

Section 4.3 _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, other than as
provided in _Section 4.3(b)_ any Common Shares or Series A Preferred Shares
that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a stockholder who is entitled to demand, and who has properly
demanded, appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted as
set forth in _Section 4.1_, but shall instead be entitled only to such rights
with respect to such Dissenting Shares as may be granted to such stockholder
under the DGCL. From and after the Effective Time, Dissenting Shares shall not
be entitled to vote for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of dividends
or other distributions (except dividends or other distributions payable to
stockholders of record prior to the Effective Time). The Company shall
promptly provide any notices of dissent and any other information or documents
with respect thereto that it receives to Parent, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to each such dissent. Except with the prior written consent of Parent,
the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or
settle, any such dissent. 

(b) If any stockholder who holds Dissenting Shares withdraws or loses (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) such stockholders right to obtain payment
of the fair value of such stockholders Dissenting Shares under the DGCL,
then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such
withdrawal or loss, such stockholders shares shall no longer be Dissenting
Shares and, if the occurrence of such withdrawal or loss is later than the
Effective Time, shall be treated as if they had as of the Effective Time been
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration, without interest, as
set forth in _Section 4.1_.

Section 4.4 _Treatment of Stock Options and Other Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Options_. The Company shall take such actions that it deems
necessary or appropriate so that (i) immediately prior to the Acceptance
Time, each then outstanding compensatory option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock (" _Company Option_ ") under each Company Equity Plan becomes
fully vested and exercisable and (ii) by virtue of the occurrence of the
Acceptance Time and without any action on the part of any holder of any
Company Option, each Company Option outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time shall be cancelled and the holder thereof becomes entitled
to receive a cash payment from the Company with respect thereto equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of the Common Stock
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option,
by (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
such Company Option, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law in accordance with _Section 4.5_. In the event that the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to a Company Option
is equal to or greater than the Common Stock Merger Consideration, such
Company Option shall be cancelled with no payment due to the holder thereof
and such Company Option shall be of no further force or effect. Parent or

 



23  Purchaser shall cause any cash payments required pursuant to this _Section
4.4(a)_ to be paid by the Surviving Company as promptly as reasonably
practicable (but in any event not later than the next regular payroll payment
date following the Acceptance Time, and in all events in compliance with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code).

 

(b) _Company Restricted Stock Awards_. The Company shall take such actions
that it deems necessary or appropriate so that each restricted share of
Company Common Stock (" _Company Restricted Stock_ ") that is outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall, by virtue of the occurrence
of the Acceptance Time and without any action on the part of any holder of
any share of Company Restricted Stock, be fully vested immediately prior to
the Acceptance Time and shall be treated in the manner set forth in this
_ARTICLE IV_ with respect to shares of Company Common Stock. In connection
with the Offer, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts under any
Company Equity Plans, including granting any waivers, consents or approvals
conditioned upon the Acceptance Time, to permit holders of Company Restricted
Stock to tender such Company Restricted Stock in the Offer.

(c) _Company RSUs_. The Company shall take such actions that it deems
necessary or appropriate so that, as of the Acceptance Time, (i) each award
of restricted stock units granted under each Company Equity Plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time (each, a " _Company RSU_
") shall, as of the Acceptance Time, be cancelled and of no further force or
effect and (ii) in exchange for the cancellation of such Company RSU, the
holder of such Company RSU shall receive a payment equal to the Common Stock
Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock underlying such
Company RSU, whether or not otherwise vested as of the Acceptance Time,
subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance
with _Section 4.5_. For each Company RSU the vesting of which is subject to
the attainment of performance goals for which the applicable performance
period is not complete as of the Acceptance Time, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock for which payment shall be made hereunder shall be equal
to one hundred percent (100%) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that could be earned pursuant to such Company RSU assuming attainment of one
hundred percent (100%) of all applicable targets. Parent or Purchaser shall
cause any cash payments required pursuant to this _Section 4.4(c)_ to be
paid by the Surviving Company as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in
any event not later than the next regular payroll payment date following the
Acceptance Time, and in all events in compliance with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code).

(d) _Termination of Company Equity Plans_. The Company shall take such
actions that it deems necessary or appropriate so that, as of the Acceptance
Time, the Company Equity Plans shall be terminated and no further shares of
Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company Restricted Stock, Company RSUs
or other rights with respect to shares of Company Common Stock shall be
granted thereunder.

Section 4.5 _Withholding Tax_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Company,
Purchaser, the Surviving Company and Parent may deduct or withhold from the
consideration payable to any Person pursuant to _ARTICLE II_ , _ARTICLE III_
or _ARTICLE IV_ such amounts required to be deducted or withheld with respect
to such payments under applicable Tax Law. If the Paying Agent, the Company,
Purchaser, the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds
amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as

 



24  having been paid to the Person in respect of which the Paying Agent, the
Company, Purchaser, the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be, made
such deduction or withholding. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a certificate in accordance with the requirements of Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3) stating that the Company is
not, and has not been at any time during the five-year period ending on the
Closing Date, a "United States real property holding corporation" within the
meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code, in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent.

 

Section 4.6 _Series A Share Purchase_. Immediately following the Acceptance
Time and prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and the Effective Time,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Series A Purchase
Agreement, Purchaser shall purchase the Series A Preferred Shares covered
thereby (the " _Series A Share Purchase_ "). Parent and Purchaser shall take
all necessary or appropriate action to waive, effective as of the Series A
Share Purchase, any requirement that Common Shares be reserved or otherwise
committed to be issued with respect to the conversion of Series A Preferred
Shares.

filing dates (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date
hereof, as of the date of such filing), the SEC Documents (i) complied in all

of the Company and its Subsidiaries, any properties, assets, liabilities,
revenues or expenses in any material respect, or that have identified any

in accordance with GAAP. Since December 31, 2011, the Company has disclosed to
the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (and

deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) to the Knowledge of the

limit the Companys right to amend, modify or terminate any Benefit Plan or

Section 6.6 _Financing_. 

(a) Assuming (i) the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing
Letters and (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in paragraphs
(c)(ii) and (c)(iii) of _Annex I_ , the amount of funds to be provided

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company copies of (i) an executed commitment
letter, dated the date hereof, between Parent, Purchaser and the Guarantor
(the " _Equity Financing Letter_ "), pursuant to which the Guarantor has

therein, to make an investment in Purchaser in cash in the aggregate
amount set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ ") and (ii) an executed
commitment letter and Redacted Fee Letter, each dated the date hereof, between
Parent, Purchaser and the financial institution identified therein (the "
_Lender_ ", and, together with its Affiliates and Representatives and
successors and assigns, the " _Debt Financing Sources_ ") (collectively, the "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Equity Financing Letter,
the " _Financing Letters_ ") pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources have
committed, upon the terms and subject only to the conditions set forth
therein, to provide debt financing to Parent or Purchaser in the amounts set
forth therein (such debt financing solely with respect to the Transactions,
the

 



44  " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with the Equity Financing, the "
_Financing_ "). " _Redacted Fee Letter_ " means a fee letter from a financing
source in which the only redactions relate to fee amounts, "market flex"
provisions and "securities demand" provisions; _provided_ that such redactions
do not relate to any terms that would adversely affect the
conditionality, enforceability, availability, termination or aggregate
principal amount of the Debt Financing or other funding being made available
by such financing source, except to the extent a reduction in the principal
amount of the Debt Financing from such financing source is offset by an
increase in the Debt Financing or other funding being made available by such
financing source or another financing source.

 

(c) As of the date hereof, each of the Financing Letters is in full force and
effect and has not been terminated, amended or modified in any respect, no
such termination, amendment or modification is presently proposed and the
respective commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn, rescinded or

other contractual contingencies related to the obligations of the Guarantor
to fund the Equity Financing or of the Debt Financing Sources to fund the Debt

Commitment Letter, respectively. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred
and no circumstance exists which, with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach
on the part of Parent, Purchaser or the Guarantor or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any other party, under the Financing Letters; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent and Purchaser are not making any representation or warranty
regarding the effect of any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties
of the Company set forth herein. As of the date hereof, Parent and Purchaser
have no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
contemplated in the Financing Letters will not be satisfied or that
the Financing will not be made available to Parent or Purchaser at or prior
to the Acceptance Time. There are no side letters or other Contracts or
arrangements to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related to
the funding or investing, as applicable, of the Financing other than as
expressly contained in the Financing Letters and any customary engagement and
similar letters and non-disclosure agreements that do not impact the
conditionality, enforceability, availability, termination or aggregate amount
of the Financing. As of the date hereof, Parent or Purchaser has fully paid,
or caused to be fully paid, any and all commitment or other fees which are due
and payable on or prior to the date hereof pursuant to the terms of
the Financing Letters. Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the obtaining of
the Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to Purchasers
obligation to effect the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the
Offer or to consummate the Merger.

Section 6.7 _Share Ownership; No Interested Stockholder_. Except for any such
beneficial ownership as may be deemed to exist as a result of the Support

such beneficial ownership as may be deemed to exist as a result of the Support
Agreements, none of Parent, Purchaser or any of their "affiliates" or
"associates" is, has been within the last three (3) years, or will be at any
time prior to the Acceptance Time, an "interested stockholder" of the Company
as those terms are defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

 



45 Section 6.8 _Litigation; Orders_.

 

(a) As of the date hereof, there is no Action pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened in writing against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

finders, financial advisory or similar fee or commission from Parent or its
Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.

Section 6.10  _Solvency_. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in _Annex I_ , after giving effect to the Transaction, the payment of
the aggregate Offer Price, the aggregate consideration in respect of the
Series A Share Purchase, the aggregate Merger Consideration, the Top-Up Par
Value Payment and the consideration provided herein in respect of Company
Options and Company RSUs and all fees, expenses and other amounts required to
be paid by Parent or Purchaser or, following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and
the Financing, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
will be Solvent as of immediately following the Effective Time. The term "
_Solvent_ ", when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date
of determination: (a) the amount of the fair saleable value of the assets of
such Person will, as of such date, exceed, without duplication, the value of
all liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities, as
of such date; (b) such Person, as of such date, will not have an unreasonably
small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is
engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date; and (c) such Person
will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other
liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means
that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset
dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations
as they become due.

 

Section 6.11 _Top-Up Option_. Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up
Option Shares that Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option
will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance
upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering.
Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that Purchaser is,
and will be upon the purchase of the Common Shares issued pursuant to the Top-
Up Option, an " _Accredited Investor_ ," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation
D promulgated under the Securities Act. Purchaser represents and warrants
that the Top-Up Option and the Common Shares to be acquired upon exercise of
the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and will be acquired by Purchaser for the
purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act.

 



46 Section 6.12 _Limited Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, the Guarantor has delivered to the Company the duly executed
Limited Guaranty. The Limited Guaranty is in full force and effect and
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable
against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, and no event has occurred
which, with or without notice or lapse of time, or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of the
Guarantor under the Limited Guaranty.

 

Section 6.13 _Series A Purchase Agreement_. The Series A Purchase Agreement is
in full force and effect as of the date hereof. No event has occurred that
constitutes or would constitute a default or breach (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) on the part of Parent or Purchaser under the Series A
Purchase Agreement.

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) afford to the Representatives of Parent and Purchaser
reasonable access, in a manner not unduly disruptive to the operations of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable notice, to the properties, books and records of the Company

 



49  and its Subsidiaries and, during such period, shall (and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to) furnish to such Representatives all information
concerning the business, properties and personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in each case as may reasonably be requested; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing herein shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to disclose any information to Parent or Purchaser if
such disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) violate
applicable Law (including applicable Antitrust Laws) or any request or
requirement of any Governmental Authority or the provisions of any agreement
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, (ii) result in
the waiver of any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (iii) violate
any confidentiality agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party (in each case, it being agreed that the Company shall give notice
to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such access or information and
thereafter the Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause such access or information, as applicable, to be provided,
or made available, in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to cause
such a violation, disclosure, waiver or breach).

 

(b) The Confidentiality Agreement shall apply with respect to information
furnished under this _Section 8.1_ by the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their Representatives. Prior to the Closing and except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and Purchaser shall not, and
shall cause their respective Representatives not to, contact or otherwise
communicate with the employees (other than senior executives), customers,
suppliers, distributors, labor unions, landlords, lessors, banks or other
lenders of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or, except as required pursuant
to _Section 8.2_, any Governmental Authority, regarding the business of the
Company, this Agreement or the Transactions without the prior written consent
of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

 

Section 8.2 _Efforts to Consummate the Transactions_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts
to (i) make promptly its filings, and thereafter make any other required
submissions, under the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions, (ii) take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and
make effective the Transactions as promptly as practicable, including using
its reasonable best efforts to obtain any requisite approvals, consents,
authorizations, orders, exemptions or waivers by any Third Person (
_provided_ that in respect of Contracts between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with any Third Person, none of the Parties shall be required to
make or agree to make any payment or accept any material conditions or
obligations unless such payment, condition or obligation is contingent upon
the consummation of the Merger) in connection with the Transactions and to
fulfill the conditions to the Offer and the Merger and (iii) not take any
action that would be reasonably likely to materially delay or prevent
consummation of the Transactions. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each Party agrees to file a Notification and Report Form pursuant
to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable
(but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement) and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the
HSR Act and to use its reasonable best efforts to take all other actions
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable

  



50  waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable (and in any event
no later than the End Date), including requesting early termination of the HSR
Act waiting period. In addition, each of the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, agrees that it shall not extend any
waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Authority not to consummate the Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In addition, at any time prior
to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
not to, enter into any definitive Contract with any Third Person for the
acquisition, whether by merger, purchase of stock, purchase of assets, tender
offer or otherwise, of all or more than thirty percent (30%) of the
consolidated businesses or assets of any Third Person which, either directly
or through one or more of its Subsidiaries, is a public relations firm or
engaged in providing public relations software or services, including media
database management, news monitoring and analysis and press release
distribution (each, a " _Prohibited Transaction_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
from the date Cision AB and its controlled Affiliates become an Affiliate of
Parent until the date an Affiliate of Parent controls the board of directors
of Cision AB, Parents and its Affiliates obligations with respect to Cision
AB and its controlled Affiliates pursuant to this sentence shall be limited
to: (A) not consenting to or approving a Prohibited Transaction, (B) not
directing to Cision AB or any of its controlled Affiliates any proposal or
opportunity that would reasonably be expected to result in a Prohibited
Transaction and (C) not knowingly facilitating or encouraging the making of
any such proposal or opportunity by Cision AB or any of its controlled
Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall restrict Parent or any of its Affiliates from pursuing or consummating
the acquisition of Cision AB, including acquiring all or any portion of the
equity interests of Cision AB or any of its Affiliates in one transaction or a
series of transactions pursuant to the recommended cash offer previously
announced by an Affiliate of Parent or otherwise.

(b) Except with respect to Taxes, each of the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall (i) promptly notify the other
of and, if in writing, furnish the other with copies of (or, in the case of
oral communications, advise the other of) any communications from or with any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions, (ii) permit the
other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views
of the other in connection with, any proposed written or oral communication
with any such Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions, (iii)
not participate in any meeting or have any communication with any such
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions unless it has given
the other an opportunity to consult with it in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, give the other the opportunity to
attend and participate therein and (iv) furnish the other with copies of all
filings and communications between it and any such Governmental Authority with
respect to the Transactions;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, the rights of the Parties under this _Section 8.2(b)_ may be
exercised on their behalf by their respective outside counsel.

 

(c) Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best
efforts to vigorously contest and resist any Action, including administrative
or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that is threatened or in effect and that restricts, prevents
or prohibits consummation of the Transactions, including by using its
reasonable best efforts to pursue all available avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal.

 



51 (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this  _Section 8.2_, if any objections are asserted with
respect to the Transactions under any Law or if any suit is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by the United States Federal Trade Commission ("
_FTC_ "), the United States Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ ") or any other
Governmental Authority challenging any of the Transactions as violative of any
Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay
the consummation of the Transactions, each of Parent and Purchaser, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and
do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the Transactions, including using reasonable
best efforts to take such further action as may be necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, as the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority
may assert under any Law with respect to the Transactions, and to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by the
FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority with respect to
the Transactions so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as practicable
(and in any event no later than the End Date). Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, none of Parent, Purchaser or the Company shall
be required to take (and the Company shall not be permitted to take without
the prior written consent of Parent) any of the following actions in
connection with their efforts to consummate the Transaction: (i) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or
businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (ii) terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or
obligations of Parent or its Subsidiaries or of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (iii) creating any relationship, contractual rights or
obligations of Parent or its Subsidiaries or of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or (iv) effectuating any other change or restructuring of Parent
or its Subsidiaries or of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise taking
or committing to take any actions that limit the freedom of action of Parent
or its Subsidiaries or of the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to, or
ability to retain, one or more businesses, product lines or assets. For the
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing sentence shall not prevent the Company from
taking actions in the ordinary course of business and not otherwise
restricted under this Agreement.

(e) In furtherance, and not in limitation, of the foregoing, if following
the Acceptance Time, Purchaser shall own at least ninety-percent (90%) of
each of the then outstanding (i) shares of Company Common Stock and (ii)
shares of Series A Preferred Stock, whether as a result of the exercise of the
Top-Up Option or otherwise, the Parties shall take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as
practicable after the Acceptance Time (including by causing the transfer of
any such Shares to Purchaser), in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.
Parent, Purchaser and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all necessary
or appropriate action to transfer their respective ownership of any and all
Shares or Series A Preferred Shares to Purchaser at or prior to the
Acceptance Time and, with respect to any Shares or Series A Preferred Shares
received following the Acceptance Time, immediately upon any such receipt.

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 8.3_, (i) the Company

modify or fail to enforce any provisions of, or grant any permission, waiver
or request under, any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement entered
into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of or in
contemplation of an Acquisition Proposal (except that the Company may waive
any provision of such an agreement that would prevent a Third Person from
making an Acquisition Proposal, to the extent the Company Board determines in
good faith, based on the information then available and after consultation
with a financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to grant such
waiver would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law), (D) take any action to make the

contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal, (E) terminate, amend, release,
modify or fail to enforce any provision of, or grant any permission, waiver

of the Company Bylaws or (G) propose publicly to do any of the foregoing.
Nothing in this _Section 8.3_ shall prohibit the Company, its Subsidiaries
and its and their respective Representatives from informing any Person of the
existence of the provisions contained in this _Section 8.3_.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company,
its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives may, prior to
the Acceptance Time, participate in discussions or negotiations with a Third
Person and parties to the Support Agreements regarding, and furnish or
disclose non-public information to a Third Person in response to, a _bona
fide_  written Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in violation of
this _Section 8.3_ and that is submitted to the Company prior to the
Acceptance Time; _provided_ that (i) the Company Board determines in good
faith, based on the information then available and after consultation with a
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal,
(ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, based on the information
then available and after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
failing to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, (iii) prior to participating
in discussions or negotiations with, or furnishing or disclosing any nonpublic
information to, a Third Person with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, the
Company receives from such Third Person an executed confidentiality agreement
containing terms not less restrictive in the aggregate upon such Third Person
than the terms then applicable to Parents

 



53  Affiliate under the Confidentiality Agreement and compliant with the last
sentence of _Section 8.3(e)_ (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ")
and (iv) promptly (and in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours) after
furnishing or making available any material non-public information concerning
the Company and its Subsidiaries to any such Third Person, the Company
furnishes or makes available such information to Parent and its
Representatives (to the extent such information has not been previously
furnished or made available by the Company to Parent or its Representatives).
Prior to taking any of the actions referred to in this  _Section 8.3(b)_,
the Company shall (i) promptly and in any event no later than forty-eight (48)
hours prior to taking any such action, notify Parent (A) that it proposes to
furnish non-public information and/or participate in discussions or
negotiations with a Third Person as provided in this _Section 8.3(b)_, and
(B) of the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition
Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal
and (ii) keep Parent reasonably apprised on a prompt basis (and in any event
within forty-eight (48) hours) of any material developments or changes with
respect to such actions.

 

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 8.3_, the Company Board
shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Schedule 14D-9, (B) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly
or resolve to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, in any manner adverse to
Parent or Purchaser, the Company Board Recommendation, (C) if a tender offer
or exchange offer for Common Shares and/or Series A Preferred Shares that
constitutes an Acquisition Proposal is commenced, fail to recommend against
acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by the stockholders of
the Company or (D) approve, authorize or recommend or otherwise declare
advisable, or propose publicly to approve, authorize or recommend or otherwise
declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal (each of (A) through (D), a "
_Change in Recommendation_ ") or (ii) approve, authorize, recommend or enter
into, or propose publicly to approve, authorize, recommend or enter into, any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or any similar Contract relating to an
Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (an
" _Acquisition Agreement_ "), _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to
(i)(B) and (i)(C), the Company Board may refrain from taking a position with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business of the tenth
(10th) Business Day following a written request by Parent to the Company Board
to affirm the Company Board Recommendation after the first public
announcement of such Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered
a Change in Recommendation; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , the failure of
the Company Board to affirm the Company Board Recommendation on or prior to
the expiration of such ten (10) Business Day period shall constitute a Change
in Recommendation.

 

(d) If, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company receives an Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with a financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior
Proposal, the Company Board may, prior to the Acceptance Time, effect a Change
in Recommendation if, and only if:

 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
three (3) Business Days in advance, of its determination to effect a Change
in Recommendation pursuant to this _Section 8.3(d)_, which notice shall
specify the basis for such Change in Recommendation and the identity of the
Person making such Superior Proposal and the material terms and conditions

 



54  thereof and shall include an unredacted copy of such Superior Proposal
(including any materials relating to such Third Persons proposed financing
sources, if any); _provided_ that in the event of any material revisions to
the Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has determined to be a
Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of  _Section 8.3(d)_
with respect to such new written notice (except that references to three (3)
Business Days in this _Section 8.3(d)(i)_ shall be deemed to be references to
two (2) Business Days);

 

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after the
conclusion of the negotiations provided for in _clause (iii)_ below,
consideration of any changes to this Agreement, the Financing Letters or the
Limited Guaranty offered by Parent pursuant to _clause (iv)_ below and
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law;

(iii) after providing such notice, the Company shall have negotiated, and
shall have caused its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate)
during such three (3) or two (2) Business Day period, as applicable, to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Financing
Letters and the Limited Guaranty as would permit the Company Board not to
effect a Change in Recommendation pursuant to this  _Section 8.3(d)_; and

(iv) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement, the Financing Letters and the Limited Guaranty that may be offered
in writing by Parent no later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the last day of
such three (3) or two (2) Business Day period, as applicable, in a manner that
would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company, and shall have
determined that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior
Proposal if such changes were to be given effect.

 

(e) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
_Section 8.3_, the Company shall (i) promptly and in any event within forty-
eight (48) hours after the receipt thereof, notify Parent of (A) any
Acquisition Proposal received by the Company or its Subsidiaries and (B) the
identity of the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal
and the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and (ii)
promptly, and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours after the occurrence
thereof, notify Parent of any material developments or changes with respect
to any of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives not to, enter into any Contract that would prohibit
any of them from providing the information required to be provided to Parent
pursuant to this _Section 8.3_.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 8.3_ shall prohibit the Company
Board, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from taking and
disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the

 



55  Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any
disclosure to the stockholders of the Company required by applicable Law,
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board shall not make a Change in
Recommendation other than in compliance with this _Section 8.3_. For the
avoidance of doubt, a "stop, look and listen" communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, an express
rejection of any Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the
Company Board Recommendation shall not be deemed to be a Change in
Recommendation for purposes of this Agreement.

 

(g) If, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board determines that, based
on the information then available and after consultation with a financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, an Intervening Event has occurred and is
continuing, the Company Board may, prior to the Acceptance Time, effect a
Change in Recommendation if, and only if:

 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
three (3) Business Days in advance, of its determination to effect a Change
in Recommendation pursuant to this _Section 8.3(g)_, which notice shall
include a summary of the Intervening Event; _provided_ that in the event of
any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to the
Intervening Event, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 8.3(g)_
with respect to such new written notice (except that for purposes of this
proviso, references to three (3) Business Days in this _Section 8.3(g)(i)_
shall be deemed to be references to two (2) Business Days);

 

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after the
conclusion of the negotiations provided for in clause (iii) below,
consideration of any changes to this Agreement, the Financing Letters or the
Limited Guaranty offered by Parent pursuant to clause (iv) below and
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law;

(iii) after providing such notice, the Company shall have negotiated, and
shall have caused its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate)
during such three (3) or two (2) Business Day period, as applicable, to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Financing
Letters and the Limited Guaranty as would permit the Company Board not to
effect a Change in Recommendation pursuant to this  _Section 8.3(g)_; and

(iv) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement, the Financing Letters and the Limited Guaranty that may be offered
in writing by Parent no later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the last day of
such three (3) or two (2) Business Day period, as applicable, in a manner that
would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company, and shall have made
the determination required pursuant to _Section 8.3(g)(ii)_ if such changes
were to be given effect.

 



56 (h) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this  _Section 8.3_ by its Subsidiaries or the Companys or its
Subsidiaries respective directors, officers, employees or other
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement (including
this _Section 8.3_) by the Company, regardless of whether or not the Company
shall have used its reasonable best efforts with respect to the actions of its
and its Subsidiaries Representatives.

 

Section 8.4 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) As of the Acceptance Time, and for a period of at least one (1) year
following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company) to provide each employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as of the Acceptance Time (each, an " _Employee_
") with employee benefits, base salary or wages, bonus opportunities and
other compensation that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to
those in effect for such Employee immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, to
the extent that such benefits, salary, wages, bonus and other compensation
plans, policies or agreements (other than those arising under applicable Law)
have been made available to Parent on or prior to the date hereof; _provided_
that no equity or equity-based or change in control or other special or non-
recurring compensation or benefits shall be taken into account for purposes
of this covenant. Without limiting any other provision of this _Section
8.4(a)_, Parent shall provide or cause its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Company) to provide each Employee who incurs a termination of
employment during the one (1) year period following the Acceptance Time with
severance payments and severance benefits that are substantially comparable,
in the aggregate, to the severance payments and severance benefits to which
such Employee would have been entitled with respect to such termination under
the severance plans or policies of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary as
in effect immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, to the extent
such severance plans or policies (other than those arising under applicable
Law) have been made available to Parent on or prior to the date hereof.

 

(b) From and after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall honor or cause to be
honored, in accordance with their terms, all Benefit Agreements and all CBAs.

(c) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Company) following the Effective Time and in which any of the Employees
participate (the " _Parent Plans_ "), and except to the extent necessary to
avoid duplication of benefits, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting, accrual of and entitlement to benefits (but not for
accrual of defined benefit pension benefits) and all other purposes, service
with the Company and its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent
the Company currently provides past service credit) shall be treated as
service with Parent and its Subsidiaries. Each applicable Parent Plan shall
waive eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements and
pre-existing condition limitations to the extent waived or not applicable
under the corresponding Benefit Plan. The Employees shall be given credit
under the applicable Parent Plan for amounts paid prior to the Effective Time
during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs under a corresponding
Benefit Plan for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-
pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Parent Plan.

 



57 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that no provision contained in this _Section 8.4_ (i) shall be
treated as an establishment, amendment or other modification of any Benefit
Plan, Benefit Agreement, Parent Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement
or other arrangement, (ii) shall limit the right of Parent, the Company or
their respective Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any
Benefit Plan, Benefit Agreement or Parent Plan following the Acceptance Time,
(iii) shall be considered to be a guarantee of continued employment or any
particular term or condition of employment for any Employee or other
individual or (iv) shall give any Person (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Employee) other than the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
(including any third-party beneficiary rights).

 

Section 8.5 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Following the Acceptance Time, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to)
(i) honor and fulfill in all respects all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Acceptance Time in favor of each then-
current present and former director and officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and each individual who is then serving or has served at the
request of the Company as a director, officer or trustee of another Person, in
each case determined as of the Acceptance Time (each such individual, an "
_Indemnified Party_ "), as provided in the Companys and its Subsidiaries
respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) or any indemnification or other agreements of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect as of the date
hereof, and (ii) until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time,
cause the Surviving Companys and its Subsidiaries respective certificates
of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as the
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions contained
in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, which
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such
modification is required by applicable Law.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section 8.5(a)_,
during the period commencing at the Acceptance Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to) indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnified Party from and against any costs, fees and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement
in connection with any Action, investigation or inquiry, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such Action,
investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains
directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or
omission in such Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (regardless of whether such
action or omission, or alleged action or omission,

 



58  occurred at or prior to the Effective Time), or (ii) any of the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Party delivers to
Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this
_Section 8.5(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim
is fully and finally resolved. In addition, during the period commencing at
the Acceptance Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries to) advance, prior to the final disposition of
any Action, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought
under this Agreement, promptly following request by an Indemnified Party
therefor, all reasonable costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and investigation expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with any such Action, investigation or inquiry upon receipt of
an undertaking by such Indemnified Party to repay such advances if it is
ultimately decided in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Party delivers to Parent a
written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this _Section
8.5(b)_, then such Indemnified Partys right to advancement of costs, fees and
expenses pursuant to this _Section 8.5(b)_ with respect to the claim asserted
in such notice shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.

(c) Prior to the Acceptance Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall purchase a six (6)-year "tail"
prepaid directors and officers liability insurance policy for a premium not
to exceed two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of the last annual premium
paid prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy in effect as of the date
hereof on terms with respect to the coverage and amount that are
substantially equivalent in the aggregate to those of the Companys directors
and officers liability insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof, for
the benefit of the Indemnified Parties with respect to their acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _Tail Policy_ ");
_provided_ , that the Company shall not pay more than two hundred and fifty
percent (250%). Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving Company to
maintain the Tail Policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their
respective obligations thereunder for the entire coverage period of the Tail
Policy.

 

(d) This _Section 8.5_ (i) is intended to benefit and be enforceable by the
Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and representatives, and shall
be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, Purchaser, the Company,
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) is in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification, contribution or
insurance that any such individual may have by contract or otherwise.

(e) In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) in one or more series of transactions, directly or indirectly,
transfers or conveys a majority of its consolidated assets to any Person
(whether by consolidation, merger or otherwise), then, and in each such case,
proper

 



59  provision shall be made so that the successors, assigns and transferees of
the Surviving Company or its respective successors or assigns, as the case may
be, assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 8.5_.

Section 8.6 _Financing_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and
Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on
the terms, and subject to the conditions (including any "market flex"
provisions), set forth in the Financing Letters, including using their
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Letters
in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, (ii) negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions (including any "market flex" provisions) set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter (or with conditions no less favorable to Parent and
Purchaser than the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter), (iii)
complete the Marketing Materials (with the assistance of the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.6(c)_) and assist Lender in initiating its marketing
of the Debt Financing as promptly as practicable following the date hereof,
(iv) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding in the Financing
Letters and the definitive agreements relating to the Financing (other than,
with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter, any condition as to which the
failure to be so satisfied is a direct result of the Companys failure to
furnish information required to be furnished by the Company under _Section
8.6(c)_) and not take any action or omit to take any action to cause the
Financing to be unavailable at Closing, (v) consummate the Financing at or
prior to the Acceptance Time, including using its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Persons committing to fund the Financing to fund the Financing at or
prior to the Acceptance Time and (vi) comply with its obligations under the
Financing Letters, it being understood that Parent and Purchaser shall not be
in breach of their obligations set forth above on account of any failure to so
comply directly resulting from any inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth herein or any failure by the Company to
comply with its obligations hereunder. Parent and Purchaser shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Company, permit any amendment or modification
to be made to, or consent to any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the
Financing Letters or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing if
such amendment, modification or waiver would (A) reduce the aggregate amount
of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount), unless (1) the Debt Financing or the Equity
Financing is increased by a corresponding amount or the Debt Financing is
otherwise made available to fund such reduction, or such fees or original
issue discount, and (2) after giving effect to any of the transactions
referred to in the immediately preceding clause (1), the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 6.6_ shall be true and correct, or (B)
impose additional conditions precedent to the availability of the Financing
or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the Financing,
or otherwise expand, amend or modify any other provision of the Financing
Letters, in each case in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (1)
delay or prevent or make less likely to occur the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) or (2) adversely impact the
ability of Parent or Purchaser to enforce its rights against other parties to
the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect to the
Financing, in the case of each of the immediately preceding clauses (1) and
(2), in any material respect (provided that, subject to compliance with the
other provisions of this _Section 8.6(a)_, Purchaser may amend (x) the Debt
Commitment Letter to add additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents
and other commitment parties and (y) the 

 



60  definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing to give effect to
"market flex" provisions). Parent or Purchaser shall promptly deliver to the
Company copies of any amendment, modification or waiver to or under any
Financing Letter (other than any portion thereof that sets forth terms of the
type that were subject to redaction in the Redacted Fee Letter) or the
material definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing, if executed
and delivered prior to the Acceptance Time.

(b) Parent and Purchaser shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of their efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing and promptly provide to the Company copies of the
material definitive documents for the Debt Financing if executed and delivered
prior to the Acceptance Time. Parent and Purchaser shall give the Company
prompt notice (i) of any breach or default by any party to any of the
Financing Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing of which
Parent or Purchaser becomes aware, or (ii) of the receipt of any written
notice or other written communication, in each case from any financing source
with respect to any (A) actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation of the Financing Letters or any provisions thereof or any
definitive agreement related to the Financing or any provisions thereof or (B)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any of the
Financing Letters or any definitive agreement related to the Financing. Upon
the occurrence of any circumstance referred to in clause (i) or (ii) of the
preceding sentence, or if any portion of the Debt Financing otherwise becomes
unavailable on the terms and subject to the conditions (including any
applicable "market flex" provisions) contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter, and such portion is reasonably required to fund the aggregate Offer
Price, the aggregate consideration in respect of the Series A Share Purchase,
the aggregate Merger Consideration, and the consideration provided herein in
respect of Company Options and Company RSUs and all fees, expenses and other
amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement, Parent and Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange
and obtain in replacement thereof alternative financing from alternative
sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions with terms and
conditions not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent and the
Company than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. Upon the
commencement of the Marketing Period, Parent shall give written notice
thereof to the Company. Parent and Purchaser shall deliver to the Company true
and correct copies of all debt commitment letters, contracts or other
arrangements (including Redacted Fee Letters) pursuant to which any such
alternative source shall have committed to provide any portion of the Debt
Financing. As used in this Agreement, " _Debt Financing_ " shall include any
debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as amended, modified
or replaced as permitted by this _Section 8.6_, (1) the term " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ " shall include such documents as amended, modified or
replaced as permitted by this _Section 8.6_ and (2) the term " _Lender_ "
shall include any Person or Persons providing a commitment under any
alternative debt financing commitment permitted under this _Section 8.6_.

 

(c) Prior to the Expiration Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable
best efforts to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and their respective Representatives to provide, to Parent and Purchaser
such cooperation reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser as is necessary
and customary in connection with the arrangement of financings similar to the

 



61  Debt Financing (provided that such requested cooperation is consistent with
applicable Law and does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations
of the Company or its Subsidiaries), including: (i) providing pertinent and
customary information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the Debt Financing, to the extent such information is
reasonably available to the Company, to the Debt Financing Sources, (ii)
participating (and using its reasonable best efforts to cause its senior
management and Representatives to participate) in a reasonable number of
meetings with and presentations to prospective Debt Financing Sources and
meetings with rating agencies, (iii) providing the Required Information, (iv)
assisting in the preparation of documents and materials, including (x) the
Marketing Materials (to the extent relating to the Company and its business,
operations, financial performance and industry overview and to the extent
customary and reasonably necessary for Parent and the Debt Financing Sources
to prepare such materials in respect of the Debt Financing), (y) executing and

in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or (B) any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided
in writing by the Company or its Subsidiaries). Nothing contained in this

Subsidiaries to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt
Financing prior to the Effective Time. All material, non-public information

of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in

made and all benefits that have been granted or are to be granted pursuant to
employment compensation, severance and other employee benefits plans of the
Company, including the Benefit Plans (the " _Benefit Arrangements_ "), as an
"employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of the non-exclusive safe
harbor with respect to such Benefit Arrangements in accordance with Rule
14d-10(d)(2) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 8.10 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition", "fair
price", "business combination" or other anti-takeover Law (a " _Takeover
Statute_ ") becomes or is deemed to be applicable to any of the Transactions,
the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all action reasonably necessary so that such Transactions may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on such Transactions.

 



63 Section 8.11 _Resignation of Directors_. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent prior to the Closing (to be

exclusive remedy (whether based in contract, tort or strict liability, by the
enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws or otherwise) against the
Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or

Agreement or the Transactions, and upon payment of such amount, none of the
Company Related Parties or any Person who pays the Termination Fee on Parents
or Purchasers behalf shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. Other than
indemnification and expense reimbursement provisions in _Section 8.6(d)_, the
Companys receipt of the Parent Termination Fee (if received) from or on
behalf of Parent or Purchaser shall be the Company and its Subsidiaries sole
and exclusive remedy (whether based in contract, tort or strict liability, by

all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable expenses of counsel)
actually incurred or accrued by Parent in connection with the collection
and enforcement of this _Section 10.2_ and (ii) pay Parent interest on the

agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of
specific performance in accordance with the terms of _Section 11.16_ and the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee under _Section 10.2(c)_, under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance under _Section 11.16_ and the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 10.2(c)_.

Letter to the extent permitted by and in accordance with the sixth and eighth

_EFL Claims_ "), and (c) recourse against the Guarantor under the Limited
Guaranty solely to the extent provided therein, any claim or cause of action
under this Agreement may only be brought against Persons that are expressly

Purchaser or of or for any action, suit, arbitration, claim, litigation,
investigation, or proceeding, in each case under, based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, this Agreement or the Transactions (including the breach,
termination or failure to consummate such Transactions), in each case whether
based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any
assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute,
regulation or applicable Laws or otherwise and whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate, limited liability company or partnership veil, by
or through a claim by or on behalf of a Party or another Person (including

any and all respects, by written agreement of the Parties, at any time prior
to the Effective Time with respect to any of the terms contained herein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such amendment, modification or supplement
shall result in the Common Stock Merger Consideration not being the same
amount and kind of cash, property, rights or securities as the consideration

interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent

shall relieve Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, of its obligations
hereunder; _provided_ , _further_ , that each of Parent and Purchaser may
assign this Agreement and its rights hereunder without the prior written
consent of the other parties to any of their respective financing sources

rights hereunder as collateral in respect of the Debt Financing. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns.

Section 11.6 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
the Series A Purchase Agreement, the Support Agreements, the Limited
Guaranty, the Equity Financing Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement (a)
constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and (b) except for (i) the rights of the
Companys stockholders, from and after the Acceptance Time, to receive the
Offer Price or, from and after the Effective Time, to receive the Merger
Consideration, as applicable, and, from and after the Acceptance Time, the
holders of Company Options, Company Restricted Stock or Company RSUs to
receive the consideration described in _Section 4.4_, in each case, from and
after the Acceptance Time and the Effective Time, as applicable, and in
accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
(ii) as provided in _Section 11.12(b)_ (which is intended for the benefit of
the Debt Financing Sources) and (iii) as provided in _Section 8.5_ (which is
intended for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties, all of whom shall be
third-party beneficiaries of _Section 8.5_), are not intended to confer upon
any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Debt Financing Source is an express third
party beneficiary of the last sentence of _Section 10.2(e)_,  _Section
10.3_, _Section 11.3_, _Section 11.5_, _Section 11.12(b)_ and this _Section
11.6_.

 

Section 11.7 _Public Disclosure_. The Company and Parent shall agree on the
form and content of any initial press release and, except with the prior
written consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), shall not, and

 



72  shall cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives not to, issue
any other press release or other public statement or communication with
respect to this Agreement or the Transactions;  _provided_ that the Company
or Parent may, without the prior written consent of the other, issue such
communication or make such public statement (a) as may be required by
applicable Law or Securities Exchange Rules and, if practicable under the
circumstances, after reasonable prior consultation with the other, or (b) to
enforce its rights under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
Party will be required to obtain the prior agreement of or consult with the
other Party in connection with any such press release or public announcement
if and after the date and time at which the Company Board has effected a
Change in Recommendation in accordance with _Section 8.3_ or terminated
this Agreement in accordance with _ARTICLE X_.

Section 11.8 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, whether or not the Transactions are consummated, all direct
and indirect costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the Transactions shall be borne by the Party incurring such expenses;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent shall bear the HSR Act filing fee
pursuant to _Section 8.2_.

Section 11.9 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. Disclosures on the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in sections corresponding to the
numbered and lettered sections of this Agreement, and any disclosure set forth
on any section thereof shall be deemed to be disclosed by the Company for all
sections of this Agreement and all other sections of the Company Disclosure
Schedule to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is
applicable to such other sections of this Agreement or such other sections of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. The headings contained in the Company
Disclosure Schedule are for convenience of reference only and shall not be
deemed to modify or influence the interpretation of the information contained
therein or in this Agreement. The inclusion of any information in any section
of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment by the Company or otherwise imply that such information is
required to be listed in any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or
that any such matter rises to a Company Material Adverse Effect, or is
material to or outside the ordinary course of business. Matters reflected in
the Company Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters
required by this Agreement to be reflected therein. Such additional matters
are set forth for informational purposes and do not necessarily include other
matters of a similar nature. All references in the Company
Disclosure Schedule to the enforceability of agreements with third parties,
the existence or non-existence of third-party rights, the absence of breaches
or defaults by third parties or similar matters or statements are intended
only to allocate rights and risks between the Company, Purchaser and Parent
and are not intended to be admissions against interests, give rise to any
inference or proof of accuracy, be admissible against any Party by any Person
who is not a Party or give rise to any claim or benefit to any Person who is
not a Party. In addition, the disclosure of any matter in the Company
Disclosure Schedule is not to be deemed an admission that such matter actually
constitutes noncompliance with or a violation of applicable Law, Governmental
Authorization or Contract or other topic to which such disclosure is
applicable. No reference in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall by itself be
construed as an admission or indication that a Contract or other document is
enforceable or currently in effect except to the extent provided in this
Agreement. Where a Contract or other document is referenced, summarized or
described in the Company Disclosure Schedule, such reference, summary or
description does not purport to be a complete statement of the terms or
conditions of such Contract or other document and such reference, summary or
description is qualified in its entirety by the specific terms and conditions
of such Contract or other document.

 



73 Section 11.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any dispute arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination or validity thereof
(whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) shall be governed and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
to be made and performed entirely therein without giving effect to the
principles of conflicts of law thereof or of any other jurisdiction that would
cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

 

Section 11.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each Party hereby submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if such Court
does not have jurisdiction of the dispute, other state or federal courts in
Delaware, including any appellate courts thereof (the " _Delaware Courts_ "),
for any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach,
termination or validity thereof (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise). Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceedings brought in
the Delaware Courts. With respect to any such proceeding, each of the Parties
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any
such court (a) that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the
Delaware Courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in
accordance with applicable Law, (b) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts or from any legal process
commenced in the Delaware Courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law that (i) the Action in the Delaware Courts is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Action is improper or (iii) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by the
Delaware Courts.

Section 11.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

 

(a) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY FOR ANY DISPUTE
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION OR
VALIDITY THEREOF OR ANY TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NEITHER THE OTHER PARTY
HERETO NOR ITS REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS OR ATTORNEYS HAVE REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY HERETO
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY
HERETO MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH PARTY HERETO HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS OF THIS _SECTION 11.12(a)_. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY
FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 



74 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any
Person in any Action of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Debt Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Commitment Letters or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby, in any forum other than the federal and New York state courts
located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York (and any
appellate courts thereof); (ii) agrees that, except as specifically set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of action (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Debt
Financing Sources in any way relating to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be
exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws
of the State of New York, and waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any
such court to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law that (x) the
Action in such courts is brought in an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of
such Action is improper or (z) the Debt Commitment Letter or the subject
matter thereof may not be enforced in or by such courts; (iii) hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such Party may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation or any other Action (whether in law
or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) directly or
indirectly arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement,
the Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way
to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby; (iv) and agrees that a final judgment in any such Action
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suite on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law; and (v) agrees that
notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and
the parties further waive any argument that such service is insufficient. The
Debt Financing Sources are intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section
11.12(b)_.

 

Section 11.13 _Service of Process_. Each Party irrevocably consents to the
service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Delaware
Courts by mailing copies thereof by registered United States mail, postage
prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant
to _Section 11.2_. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a
Party to effect service of process on the other Party by any other legally
available method.

Section 11.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which will be deemed to constitute an original, but all of which shall
constitute one and the same agreement, and may be delivered by facsimile or
other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic or pictorial
appearance of a document.

Section 11.15 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If
any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or
any circumstance, is found by a court or other Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be 

 



75  affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity
or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision,
or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as would be enforceable.

 

Section 11.16 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms on a timely basis or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that, without posting bond or other undertaking, the
Parties shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court of competent jurisdiction, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. In the event that any such action is brought in equity to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement, no Party will allege, and each Party hereby
waives the defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law.
The Parties further agree that (a) by seeking any remedy provided for in
this  _Section 11.16_, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to
seek any other form of relief that may be available to such Party under this
Agreement and (b) nothing contained in this _Section 11.16_ shall require
any Party to institute any action for (or limit such Partys right to
institute any action for) specific performance under this _Section 11.16_
before exercising any other right under this Agreement. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, the Parties agree that the provisions set
forth in _Section 10.2_ shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise
impair in any respect any Partys right to specific enforcement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of
the Company to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
remedy in connection with enforcing (i) Parents and Purchasers obligation to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded (which shall arise solely in the
Companys capacity as a third party beneficiary under the Equity Financing
Letter), (ii) Parents, Purchasers and the Series A Preferred Stockholders
obligation to cause the Series A Share Purchase to occur (which shall arise
solely in the Companys capacity as a third party beneficiary under the
Series A Purchase Agreement) or (iii) Parents or Purchasers obligation to
consummate the Offer or the Merger (but not the right of the Company to
injunctions, specific performance or other equitable remedies for obligations
other than with respect to the Equity Financing, the Series A Share Purchase
or the consummation of the Offer or the Merger) shall be subject to the
requirements that (A) with respect to the consummation of the Offer and
related Equity Financing, all conditions set forth in _Annex I_ have been
satisfied or waived, with respect to the consummation of the Series A Share
Purchase and related Equity Financing, all the conditions set forth in
_Section 1.3_ of the Series A Purchase Agreement have been satisfied or
waived, and with respect to the consummation of the Merger and related Equity
Financing, all the conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_ have been satisfied,
(B) the Debt Financing has been funded in accordance with the terms thereof
or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at or before the
consummation of the Offer and the Merger, if the Equity Financing is funded at
or before the consummation of the Offer and the Merger, respectively, and (C)
the Company has confirmed to Parent in writing that if specific performance is
granted and the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing are funded, then it is
prepared to consummate the Offer, the Top-Up Option and the Merger.

 



76 (c) If a court has issued a final and non-appealable ruling declining to
specifically enforce the obligations of Parent or Purchaser to take all
actions under this Agreement up to and including the consummation of the Offer
and Merger pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought against Parent
or Purchaser pursuant to this  _Section 11.16_, then the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company will be payment of the Parent Termination Fee in
accordance with the terms and conditions of _Section 10.2(c)_. In addition,
the Company agrees to cause any action or proceeding commenced by the Company
and pending in connection with this Agreement against Parent or Purchaser to
be dismissed with prejudice promptly, and in any event within five (5)
Business Days, after such time as Parent or Purchaser consummates the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.16_.
For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of
specific performance to the extent permitted by this  _Section 11.16_ and
the payment of the Parent Termination Fee, under no circumstances shall the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance to require Parent or Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and payment of the Parent
Termination Fee.

Section 11.17 _No Other Representations or Warranties by Parent or
Purchaser_. The Company acknowledges that, except for the representations and
warranties of Parent and Purchaser expressly set forth in _ARTICLE VI_ ,
neither Parent nor Purchaser nor any of their respective Representatives
makes any representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to Parent
or Purchaser or as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information
provided or made available to the Company or any of its Representatives.

 

Section 11.18 _No Other Representations or Warranties by the Company;
Investigation by Parent and Purchaser_. Each of Parent and Purchaser has
conducted its own independent review and analysis of the businesses, assets,
condition, operations and prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
acknowledges that each of Parent and Purchaser has been provided access to
the properties, premises and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
this purpose. In entering into this Agreement, each of Parent and Purchaser
acknowledges that, except for the representations and warranties of the
Company expressly set forth in _ARTICLE V_ , neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Representatives makes any
representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to the Company or
its Subsidiaries or as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the
information provided or made available to Parent or Purchaser or any of their
Representatives.

warranties relating to "material", "materiality", "Company Material Adverse
Effect" or similar qualifier; _provided_ , _further_ , that the condition set

and correct has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or

(iii) the Company shall have failed to perform or to comply in all material
respects with the covenants and agreements required to be performed or

Merger set forth in _ARTICLE IX_ of the Agreement or the absence of the
funding of the Equity Financing, the Required Amount of the Debt Financing
will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the consummation of
the Offer and the Closing of the Merger (the " _Financing Proceeds Condition_
");

 

(viii) (A) the Series A Purchase Agreement shall not be in full force and
effect, (B) the Series A Preferred Stockholder shall have breached the Series
A Purchase Agreement in a manner that would prevent the Series A Preferred
Stockholder from conveying title to all of the then outstanding Series A
Preferred Shares to Purchaser immediately following the Acceptance Time, (C)

Series A Certificates and Series A Book Entry

have irrevocably confirmed to Parent or Purchaser in writing that it will take
such actions within its control to complete the Series A Share Purchase,

terms of the Series A Purchase Agreement; or

(ix) the Agreement shall have been properly and validly terminated in
accordance with its terms.

requirement being satisfied shall be deemed to be satisfied if such condition
or requirement is waived. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to,
and not a limitation of, the right of Parent and Purchaser to extend,
terminate, amend and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the Agreement. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise
any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right
and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at
any time and from time to time at or prior to the Expiration Date.
