(b) Following the Closing Date, Seller will (at Parents and Buyers sole cost
and expense) reasonably cooperate with Parent, Buyer and the Target Companies
to the extent necessary to allow Parent to prepare financial statements of the
Company in accordance with Regulation S-X and meeting the requirements of Item
9.01 of Form 8-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Further Assurances_.

 



 

(a) The Parties shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to)
cooperate reasonably with each other and with their respective Representatives
in connection with any steps required to be taken as part of their respective
obligations under this Agreement, and shall furnish upon request to each other
such further information as the other Party may reasonably request for the
purpose of carrying out the intent of this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions.

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at any time or from
time to time after the date of this Agreement, at any Partys reasonable
request and without further consideration, each Party shall do all acts and
things as may be necessary or desirable and are within its control to carry
out the intent of this Agreement, including executing and delivering further
instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment, novation, confirmation
or other documents, and providing additional materials and information, that
may be reasonably required or requested.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Obligations of Buyer_. Parent shall take any and all action
necessary to cause Buyer to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Buyer Parties agrees that all rights of the individuals who on
or prior to the Closing Date were directors or officers of any of the Target
Companies (the " _Indemnitees_ ") to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as
provided in the respective Governing Documents of any of the Target Companies
as now in effect, and any indemnification Contract of the Target Companies
listed on _Schedule 8.9(a)_ , in each case which shall survive the Closing
Date and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms for a period of six (6) years from and after the Closing Date. Such
rights shall not be amended, or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights of the Indemnitees, unless such modification is
required by Legal Requirement. In addition, Parent, the Target Companies
shall, and Buyer shall cause the Target Companies to, provide advancement of
any reasonable, documented out-of-pocket expenses of any Indemnitee under this
_Section 8.9_, as incurred to the same extent such Indemnitee has the right
of advancement under the applicable Governing Documents of the

 



      
 

 



 

Target Companies as of the date hereof; _provided_ , that any Indemnitee to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances to
the extent required by applicable Legal Requirement or the applicable
Governing Documents in effect as of the date hereof.

 



 

(b) Seller shall purchase, as of the Closing Date and at its sole cost and
expense, a tail policy to the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing
Date with respect to those persons who are currently covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy, which tail policy shall
be effective from the Closing Date through and including the date six (6)
years after the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred prior to the Closing Date against each present or former
director and officer of the Target Companies who was, as of the Closing Date,
covered by the Companys officers and directors liability insurance, and
which tail policy shall contain substantially the same coverage and amounts
as, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous than, in the
aggregate, the coverage currently provided by such current policy; _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event shall Seller be required to expend, for the
entire tail policy, in excess of one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the
annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance; and, _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, if the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such
amount, Seller shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 8.9_: (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her Representatives; and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by Contract or otherwise.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Confidential Information_. Notwithstanding _Section 12.6_, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded by this Agreement but shall
remain in full force and effect until the Closing. At the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and shall no longer be of any force
or effect ( _provided_ that the foregoing will not relieve any party thereto
from liability resulting from a breach thereof prior to such termination).

 



 

Section 8.11 _Third Party Consents_. Promptly after the date hereof, Seller
shall prepare and send notices to the holders of the Required Consents,
requesting Consents to the Contemplated Transactions. Prior to Closing, each
of Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Required Consents to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing. In the event
any Required Consent is not obtained prior to Closing (or any fee payable has
not been paid in connection therewith), Seller shall continue to reasonably
assist (at Buyers sole cost and expense) Buyer and the Target Companies in
obtaining such Required Consents. For the avoidance of doubt, any consent fees
payable in connection with such Required Consents shall be paid by Buyer.

 



 

ARTICLE IX 
TERMINATION

 



 

Section 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing solely as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller, the Company and the Buyer Parties;

 



 

(b) on or after the End Date, by Seller or the Company, on one hand, or the
Buyer Parties, on the other hand, by written notice to the other Parties, if
the Closing has not occurred on or before the date such notice is given;
_provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _subsection
(b)_ shall not be available to any Party who is then in material breach of
any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement or whose failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement, in each case has been the cause
of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such
date;

 



 

(c) by Seller by written notice to the Buyer Parties if (i) the condition set
forth in _Section 7.3_ (Material Governmental Approval) shall have become
incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been waived by the Seller Parties
(unless the failure of any such condition to have been fulfilled results from
any action, or failure to act, either individually or in the aggregate, by
Seller or the Company (including the breach by Seller or the Company of any of
their respective representations or covenants contained in this Agreement)),
or (ii) any Buyer Party has breached, or caused the breach of, any of its
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations
hereunder in a manner that would reasonably be expected to cause the condition
set forth in _Section 7.1_ (Accuracy of Representations) or _Section 7.2_
(Buyer Parties Performance) not to be satisfied and such breach has not been
cured within thirty (30) days following written notification thereof by the
Seller Parties;

 



 

(d) by the Buyer Parties by written notice to the Seller Parties if (i) the
condition set forth in _Section 6.3_ (Material Governmental Approval) shall
have become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been waived by the
Buyer Parties (unless the failure of any such condition to have been fulfilled
results from any action, or failure to act, either individually or in the
aggregate, by any of the Buyer Parties (including the breach by them of any of
their respective representations or covenants contained in this Agreement)),
or (ii) the Company or any other Seller Party has breached, or caused the
breach of, its representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations hereunder in a manner that would reasonably be expected to cause
the condition set forth in _Section 6.1_ (Accuracy of Representations) or
_Section 6.2_ (Performance) not to be satisfied and such breach has not been
cured within thirty (30) days following written notification thereof by Buyer;
or

 



 

(e) by either the Seller Parties, on the one hand, or the Buyer Parties, on
the other hand, by giving written notice to the other if any Governmental Body
with competent jurisdiction shall have issued an Order or taken any other
action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of any of the Contemplated Transactions, and such Order or other
action shall not be subject to appeal or shall have become final and
unappealable; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this _subsection (e)_ shall not be available to any Party whose action or
failure to act (including the breach of this Agreement) has resulted in such
Order or other action.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 9.1_, all further obligations of the Parties hereunder
shall terminate and this Agreement shall become null and void and of no
further force and effect, except for the obligations set forth in this
_Section 9.2_, _Section 12.4_, and _Section 12.10_, and except that such

 



       
 

 



 

termination shall not relieve any Party of any Liability for any breach of
this Agreement or Fraud prior to such termination.

 



 

ARTICLE X 
TAX MATTERS

 



 

Section 10.1 _Straddle Period_. In the case of any taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "): (i)
the amount of any real, personal and intangible property Taxes, ad valorem
Taxes and similar Taxes (" _Property Taxes_ ") for the portion of such
Straddle Period through the end of the Closing Date shall be determined
between the period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date
and the period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date by
prorating such Property Taxes on a daily basis over the entire Straddle
Period, and (ii) the amount of any income Taxes or similar obligations for the
portion of such Straddle Period through the end of the Closing Date shall be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity shall be deemed to terminate at such
time).

 



 

Section 10.2 _Filing and Payment Responsibilities_. The Buyer Parties shall
cause the Target Companies to prepare and file when due all Tax Returns that
are required to be filed by the Target Companies after the Closing Date and
shall cause the Target Companies to remit any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any such Tax Return for
a taxable period beginning before the Closing Date (a " _Covered Tax Return_
"), such Covered Tax Return shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the
last previous such Tax Return (except as otherwise required by applicable
law), and the Buyer Parties shall provide to Seller a copy of each such
Covered Tax Return at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the due date of
such Covered Tax Return (taking into account all applicable extensions) for
its review and comment, such reasonable comments of Seller received by the
Buyer Parties at least five (5) Business Days prior to such due date to be
incorporated by the Buyer Parties in such Covered Tax Return as actually
filed. No Target Company shall, and the Buyer Parties shall cause each Target
Company not to, file any amended Tax Return of a Target Company for a taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date without the prior written consent of
Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Seller shall
be responsible for all Taxes shown as due and owing on any Covered Tax Return
as prepared and filed in accordance with this _Section 10.2_, but only to the
extent such Taxes (a) are attributable to any Tax period ending on or prior to
the Closing Date, or in the case of any Straddle Period, are attributable to
the portion of such Straddle Period through the end of the Closing Date (as
determined pursuant to _Section 10.1_), and (b) exceed the amount of such
Taxes taken into account in determining the Final Balance Sheet or the
Purchase Price. Seller shall reimburse the Buyer Parties for the amount of
such Taxes determined pursuant to the preceding sentence by wire transfer of
immediately available funds no later than five (5) days after receipt of
written notice (or notice delivered by electronic communication) from the
Buyer Parties.

 



 

Section 10.3 _Tax Proceedings_. Each Target Company shall control, at its sole
cost and expense, any audit, litigation, claim or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes of such Target Company (a " _Tax Proceeding_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that to the extent such Tax Proceeding could reasonably result in
any obligation of the Seller to indemnify pursuant to _Article XI_, the

 



      
 

 



 

Target Company shall, and the Buyer Parties shall cause the Target Company to,
(i) upon notice of such Tax Proceeding, promptly deliver written notice to
Seller of such Tax Proceeding, which written notice shall explain in
reasonable detail the nature of such Tax Proceeding and shall include copies
of all relevant documentation received from any taxing authority, (ii) keep
Seller reasonably informed of all developments in such Tax Proceeding, (iii)
afford Seller the opportunity to participate (at its sole cost and expense) in
the conduct and resolution of such Tax Proceeding, and (iv) not settle,
resolve or otherwise dispose of such Tax Proceeding without Sellers prior
written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed.

 



 

Section 10.4 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. The Target Companies,
Seller, and Buyer Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by any other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon such other Partys
request) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to any
such audit, litigation, Tax claim, or other proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. As applicable, the Target
Companies, Seller, and Buyer Parties agree (i) to retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the business relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Target Companies, Seller, or
Buyer Parties, as applicable, any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give each other Party reasonable
written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books
and records and, if such other Party so requests, the Target Companies, as the
case may be, shall allow such other Party to take possession of such books and
records.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Certain Tax Refunds and Credits_. Except to the extent taken
into account in determining the Final Balance Sheet or the Purchase Price, any
Tax refunds that are received by any Buyer Party or Target Company, and any
amounts credited against Tax to which any Buyer Party or Target Company are
entitled, that relate to Taxes of any Target Company (a) paid on or prior to
the Closing Date, (b) for which Seller is responsible pursuant to this
_Article X_, or (c) with respect to which Seller made an indemnity payment
pursuant to _Article XI_, in each case, shall be for the account of Seller,
and the Buyer Parties shall pay over (or cause to be paid over) to Seller any
such refund or the amount of any such credit within ten (10) days after
receipt thereof or entitlement thereto.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, all Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the Contemplated Transactions shall be borne by Seller. Seller and the
Buyer Parties shall, and the Buyer Parties and Seller shall cause the Target
Companies to, cooperate in preparing and timely making all filings, Tax
Returns, reports and forms as may be required to comply with the provisions of
the Laws relating to such Transfer Taxes. The Buyer Parties shall, subject to
reimbursement from the Seller as provided in this _Section 10.6_, pay the
Taxes shown on any such Tax Return. Seller shall reimburse the Buyer Parties
for its share of such Transfer Taxes (as provided in this _Section 10.6_) by
wire transfer of immediately available funds no later than five (5) days after
receipt of written notice (or notice delivered by electronic communication)
from the Buyer Parties. For

 



      
 

 



 

purposes of this Agreement, " _Transfer Taxes_ " shall mean all transfer,
sales, excise, value added, stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax, documentary,
registration and other such taxes (including all applicable real estate
transfer taxes).

 



 

Section 10.7 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 



 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer
an allocation schedule (the " _Proposed Allocation Schedule_ ") setting forth
that portion of the Purchase Price to be allocated among the assets of the
Target Companies pursuant to (and to the extent necessary to comply with)
Section 1060 of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations (or, if
applicable, any similar provision under state, local or foreign law or
regulation). Buyer will have thirty (30) Business Days following the Closing
Date during which to notify Seller in writing (an " _Allocation Notice_ ") of
any changes or additions to the Proposed Allocation Schedule, setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis of such changes or additions. In reviewing or
revising the Proposed Allocation Schedule, Buyer shall be entitled to
reasonable access to all relevant books, records and personnel of the Target
Companies and their Representatives to the extent Buyer reasonably requests
such information and reasonable access to complete its review or revision of
the Proposed Allocation Schedule. After Buyer submits an Allocation Notice,
then (A) for thirty (30) Business Days after the date Seller receives the
Allocation Notice, Buyer and Seller will use their commercially reasonable
efforts to agree on the allocations (such agreed-upon Proposed Allocation
Schedule to become the " _Final Allocation Schedule_ ") and (B) failing such
agreement within thirty (30) Business Days of such notice, the matter will be
resolved in accordance with _Section 10.7(b)_.

 



 

(b) Any amounts remaining in dispute at the conclusion of such thirty (30)
Business Day period that were included in the Allocation Notice (the "
_Unresolved Allocation Changes_ ") shall be submitted to an independent,
internationally recognized accounting firm jointly selected by Buyer and
Seller (the " _Expert_ "). Seller and Buyer agree to execute, if requested by
the Expert, a reasonable engagement letter. Buyer and Seller will each deliver
to the other and to the Expert a notice setting forth in reasonable detail
their proposed allocations. The Expert shall act as an arbitrator to
determine, based on the provisions of this _Section 10.7(b)_ and the
definitions referred to herein, only the Unresolved Allocation Changes. The
Expert shall be instructed to determine its best estimate of the allocation
schedule based on its determination of the Unresolved Allocation Changes and
provide a written description of the basis for its determination of the
allocations therein within forty-five (45) Business Days after the matter has
been submitted to the Expert, which written determination shall be final,
binding and conclusive. Each of the Parties shall furnish, at its own expense,
the Expert and the other Party with such documents and other written
information as the Expert may request. Each Party may also furnish to the
Expert such other written information and documents as such Party deems
relevant; _provided_ , that copies of all such documents and materials shall
be concurrently delivered to the other Party in the same manner as such
materials are delivered to the Expert. The Expert may, at its discretion,
conduct one or more conferences with respect to the dispute between the
Parties, at which conference each Party shall have the right to present such
additional documents, materials and other information and to be accompanied or
represented by such Representatives as each Party shall choose in its sole
discretion. The fees and expenses of the Expert shall be borne by Seller and
Buyer, respectively, in inverse proportion to the degree that each prevails in
the

 



      
 

 



 

dispute, which proportionate allocation shall also be determined by the
Expert. Each Party will bear the costs of its own counsel, witnesses (if any)
and employees.

 



 

(c) The Parties agree to act in accordance with the Final Allocation Schedule
for all Tax purposes (including for purposes of the filing of any Tax Return).

 



 

(d) The dispute resolution provisions of this _Section 10.7_ shall not apply
to, and the scope of the Experts authority herein shall not extend to, any
dispute of the Parties relating to the interpretation, breach or enforcement
of any provisions of this Agreement, except as may be necessary to resolve the
Unresolved Allocation Changes.

 



 

Section 10.8 _Buyer Tax Act_. The Buyer Parties shall pay and indemnify and
hold harmless Seller and its direct and indirect equity holders from and
against any Taxes of Seller (including any Taxes for which Seller is
responsible under this Agreement) or its direct or indirect equity holders
resulting from (i) any actions outside of the ordinary course of business
taken, or caused to be taken, by Buyer or Parent or any of their Affiliates
following the Closing (other than any transactions pursuant to, or
specifically contemplated by, this Agreement, or otherwise agreed to by Seller
in writing), or (ii) any Tax elections or positions (other than any Tax
elections or positions made or taken pursuant to, or specifically contemplated
by this Agreement, or otherwise agreed to by Seller in writing) that Buyer or
Parent or any of their Affiliates make (or cause to be made) or take (or cause
to be taken) with respect to any of the Target Companies following the
Closing.

(b) The covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall terminate
on the Closing Date (and no claim for any indemnification may be made

have any other rights or remedies against the other Parties from or in

have against Seller and its Affiliates arising under, based upon or relating
to this Agreement, any document or certificate delivered in connection

Section 11.3 _Indemnification by the Buyer Parties_.

 



 

(a) Subject to this _Article XI_, from and after the Closing Date, each of
the Buyer Parties, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and its Affiliates and their respective owners, officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_
") from and against any Covered Losses suffered by any such Seller Indemnified
Party resulting from or arising out of: (i) the failure of any representation
or warranty set forth in _Article V_ to be true and correct as of the Closing
Date (or with respect to any such representation or warranty made as of a
specific date, the failure of such representations and warranties to be true
and correct as of such date), in each case solely due to a Buyer Fraudulent
Misrepresentation; or (ii) any nonfulfillment or breach of any Post-Closing

Business Days after the final determination thereof.

 



 

Section 11.4 _Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. In order for a Person (the " _Indemnified Party_ ")
to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under _Section 11.2_ or
_Section 11.3_ in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any
Person against the Indemnified Party, other than a Tax Proceeding governed by
_Section 10.2_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must
notify the indemnifying party in writing (and in reasonable detail) of the
Third Party Claim within 10 Business Days after receipt by such Indemnified
Party of notice of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that
failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been
actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that
the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any expenses incurred during
the period in which the Indemnified Party failed to give such notice).
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the indemnifying party,
within five (5) Business Days time after the Indemnified Partys receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

 



 

(b) _Assumption_. If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party,
the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the indemnifying party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party.
Should the indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof. If the indemnifying party assumes such
defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel (reasonably acceptable to the
indemnifying party), at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by
the indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party shall
control such defense. The indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and
expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during
which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof (other than
during any period in which the Indemnified Party shall have failed to give
notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above) to the extent the Third
Party Claim is indemnifiable hereunder. If the indemnifying party chooses to
defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the indemnified parties shall
cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the indemnifying partys reasonable request)
the provision to the indemnifying party of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
discharge, such Third Party Claim without the indemnifying partys prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). If the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party

 



      
 

 



 

Claim that the indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms
obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in
connection with such Third Party Claim and which fully releases the
Indemnified Party of any and all obligations in connection with such Third
Party Claim.

 



 

(c) _Other Claims_. In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim
against any indemnifying party under _Section 11.2_ or _Section 11.3_ that
does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be
collected from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver
notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party.
Subject to _Section 11.1_, the failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify
the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any
liability that it may have to such Indemnified Party under _Section 11.2_ or
_Section 11.3_, except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates
that it has been actually and materially prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

(d) _Mitigation_. The Buyer Parties and Seller shall cooperate with each other
with respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one
Party is obligated to indemnify the other Party hereunder, including by making
commercially reasonably efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or
liability. In the event that the Buyer Parties or Seller shall fail to make
such commercially reasonably efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or
liability, then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained
herein, the other Party shall not be required to indemnify any Person for any
Covered Losses that could reasonably be expected to have been avoided if the
Buyer Parties or Seller, as the case may be, had made such efforts.

 



 

Section 11.5 _Determination of Loss Amount_.

 



 

(a) The amount of any and all Covered Losses under this _Article XI_ will be
determined net of (i) the present value of any Tax benefits reasonably
anticipated to be actually realized (calculated using a discount rate of 6%,
compounded monthly) by any Party seeking indemnification hereunder arising
from the deductibility (or amortization, capitalization, creditability or
other tax benefit, etc.) of any such Covered Losses and (ii) any amounts
recovered by any party or any Affiliate of a party under or pursuant to any
insurance policy, title insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement arrangement
or Contract pursuant to which or under which such party or such partys
Affiliates is a party or has rights (collectively, " _Alternative
Arrangements_ ").

 



 

(b) In no event will the Buyer Indemnified Parties be entitled to recover or
make a claim for any amounts in respect of consequential, incidental or
indirect damages, lost profits, diminutions in value or punitive damages and,
in particular, no "multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or other
valuation methodology will be used in calculating the amount of any Covered
Losses. In addition, no indemnifying party will be liable hereunder in respect
of any claim if such claim would not have arisen but for a change in
legislation or accounting policies or a change in interpretation of applicable
Legal Requirement as determined by a Governmental Body. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any Covered Loss claimed
hereunder will be reasonable and in good faith in light of the facts then
known regarding such Covered Loss .

 



      
 

 



 

(c) No Buyer Indemnified Party will be entitled to any indemnification under
this _Article XI_ for any Covered Loss to the extent any such Covered Loss
(i) was taken into account in determining the Final Balance Sheet or the
Purchase Price, (ii) was reserved or accrued for in the Financial Statements
or (iii) is disclosed in the Schedules in reference to the representation or
warranty related to such Covered Loss.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes
of the Parties indemnification obligations under this _Article XI_, all of
the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or any
certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)(iv)_, _2.4(b)(i)_ or
_2.4(c)(iv)_ that are qualified as "material," "materially," "material
respects," "material adverse effect," "Material Adverse Effect" or words of
similar import or effect shall be deemed to have been made without any such
qualification for purposes of determining (i) whether a breach of any such
representation or warranty has occurred and (ii) the amount of Covered Losses
resulting from, arising out of or relating to any such breach of
representation or warranty. Notwithstanding clause (i) of the immediately
preceding sentence, the foregoing, qualifications of materiality and words of
similar import or effect appearing in (A) the definition of Material Contracts
and (B) any of the representations set forth in _Section 3.5_, _Section
3.9(c)_, and _Section 3.16_ shall not be read out for purposes of determining
whether any of such representations or warranties have been breached.

 



 

Section 11.6 _Adjustments_. All payments made pursuant to _Article XI_ shall
be treated by the Parties hereto on all applicable Tax Returns as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 



 

Section 11.7 _Subrogation_. After any indemnification payment is made pursuant
to this _Article XI_, the indemnifying party shall, to the extent of such
payment, be subrogated to all rights (if any) of the Indemnified Party against
any Third Party in connection with the Covered Losses to which such payment
relates. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, any
Indemnified Party receiving an indemnification payment shall execute, upon the
written request of the indemnifying party, any instrument reasonable necessary
to evidence such subrogation rights.

 



 

Section 11.8 _No Other Representation_. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ (as modified by the
Schedules hereto), none of the Company or any of its Affiliates (including
Seller and the Companys Subsidiaries), Representatives of the Company or any
of its Affiliates or any other Person makes or shall be deemed to make any
other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Seller,
the Target Companies, the Transferred Interests, the Company Business or any
assets or Liabilities thereof, the Contemplated Transactions, or any other
matter, and the Seller Parties hereby disclaim any other express or implied
representations or warranties, whether made by the Company or any of its
Affiliates (including Seller and the Companys Subsidiaries), any
Representatives of the Company or any of its Affiliates or any other Person.
Except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article
III_ and _Article IV_ (as modified by the Schedules hereto), the Seller
Parties, on behalf of themselves and each of their respective Affiliates,
hereby disclaim all Liability and responsibility for any and all
representations, warranties, projections, forecasts, estimates, appraisals,
statements, promises, advice, data or information made available, communicated
or furnished (orally or in writing, including electronically) to Buyer or any
of its Affiliates or any Representatives of Buyer or any of its

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliates (including any opinion, data, information, projection, forecast,
estimate, appraisal, statement, promise or advice that may have been or may be
provided to Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any Representatives of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates by the Company or any of its Affiliates, any
Representatives of the Company or any of its Affiliates or any other Person),
or any errors in or omissions from any of the foregoing. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Seller Parties make no express or implied representations or
warranties to Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any Representatives of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates regarding the probable success or profitability or
value of the Target Companies, the Transferred Interests, the Company Business
or any assets or Liabilities thereof.

 



 

ARTICLE XII 
GENERAL PROVISIONS

 



 

Section 12.1 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, the
Seller Parties, on the one hand, and the Buyer Parties, on the other hand,
shall each bear their own costs and expenses in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions, except that nothing in this _Section 12.1_ shall preclude any
party from seeking its expenses as damages in connection with any breach of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall be solely
responsible for all filing fees in respect of the Material Governmental
Approval and all costs associated with obtaining any third party consents in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

Section 12.2 _Public Announcements and Confidentiality_. None of the Parties
nor their respective Subsidiaries, Representatives or Affiliates shall
disclose, or cause the disclosure or publication of, this Agreement or the
identity of any Party or make or issue any press release or other public
announcement or communication with respect to the Contemplated Transactions
(each, a " _Public Disclosure_ ") without the prior written consent of Seller
and Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that a Public
Disclosure directly or indirectly uses or refers to any direct or indirect
owner of Seller (each, an " _Affected Person_ "), then such Public Disclosure
must also be approved by such Affected Person with respect to each such use or
reference. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a Partys
counsel deems a Public Disclosure necessary in order to comply with the
requirements of any Legal Requirement or the regulations or policies of any
securities exchange or other similar regulatory body, then such disclosing
Party shall (i) notify Seller (who shall notify any Affected Person) and
Buyer, as applicable, prior to such disclosure, (ii) limit such disclosure to
the information required to comply with such Legal Requirement or regulations
and (iii) use reasonable efforts to accommodate any suggested changes to such
disclosure from Seller, Buyer and any Affected Person, as applicable.

Section 12.4 _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party agrees that any
Proceeding against any Party hereto arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the Contemplated Transactions shall only be brought in any
federal or state court located in the State of Delaware, and each Party hereby
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of any
such Proceeding. Each Party further agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such Partys respective
address set forth in _Section 12.3_ shall be effective service of process for
any Proceeding in the State of Delaware with respect to any matters to which
it has submitted to jurisdiction in this _Section 12.4_. EACH PARTY (ON
BEHALF OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES) HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO (A) THIS AGREEMENT, THE SCHEDULES, AND ANY CERTIFICATE OR
OTHER DOCUMENT REQUIRED TO BE DELIVERED HEREBY OR (B) THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. Each Party (a) certifies that no representative, agent or
attorney of any Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
Party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other Parties hereto have been
induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual
waivers and certifications in this _Section 12.4_.

 



 

Section 12.5 _Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. The rights and remedies of the
Parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither any
failure nor any delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege
under this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in this Agreement
will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other
or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirement, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or any
of the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by one Party,
in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless
in writing signed by the other Party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a
Party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is
given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one Party will be deemed to be a
waiver of any obligation of that Party or of the right of the Party giving
such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as
provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 12.6 _Entire Agreement and Modification_. This Agreement supersedes
all prior agreements, whether written or oral, between the Parties with
respect to its subject matter and constitutes (along with the Schedules,
Exhibits and other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement) a complete
and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement between the

 



      
 

 



 

Parties with respect to its subject matter; _provided_ that this _Section
12.6_ shall not apply to any confidentiality agreement between the Parties
related to the subject matter of this Agreement, which (subject to _Section
8.10_) shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented, or otherwise modified except
by a written agreement executed by the Buyer Parties, the Company and Seller.

 



 

Section 12.7 _Assignments, Successors and no Third-Party Rights_. No Party
may, in whole or in part, assign any of its rights or interests or delegate
any of its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of Buyer, Seller and the Company, and any attempt to do so will be void.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply to, be binding in
all respects upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted
assigns of the Parties. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement
will be construed to give any Person other than the Parties to this Agreement
any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this
Agreement or any provision of this Agreement, except as contemplated in
_Section 8.9_ and for such rights as shall inure to a successor or permitted
assignee pursuant to this _Section 12.7_.

 



 

Section 12.8 _Severability_. If any provision (or part thereof) of this
Agreement is held illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or
future Legal Requirement, and if the rights or obligations of any Party hereto
under this Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby,
(a) such provision (or part thereof) will be fully severable, (b) this
Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision (or part thereof) had never comprised a part hereof,
and (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force
and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision (or part thereof) or by its severance herefrom.

 



 

Section 12.9 _Headings_. The headings of Articles and Sections in this
Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its
construction or interpretation. All references to "Articles," "Sections" and
"Schedules" refer to the corresponding Articles, Sections and Schedules of
this Agreement, unless otherwise specified.

 



 

Section 12.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to the conflicts of law principles of such state.

 



 

Section 12.11 _Execution of Agreement_. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of
this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to
constitute one and the same agreement. The exchange of copies of this
Agreement and of signature pages by facsimile transmission or by other
electronic transmission of a manual signature (by portable data format (PDF)
or other method that enables the recipient to reproduce a copy of the manual
signature) shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this Agreement
as to the Parties and may be used in lieu of the original Agreement for all
purposes. Signatures of the Parties transmitted by facsimile or other
electronic transmission shall be deemed to be their original signatures for
all purposes.

 



 

Section 12.12 _Specific Performance_. Without intending to limit the remedies
available to the Parties hereunder, each Party acknowledges that a breach of,
conflict with, or failure to

 



      
 

 



 

perform or comply with, any of the provisions contained in this Agreement
would result in material irreparable injury to the other Party or its
Affiliates for which there is no adequate remedy at law and that it will not
be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely. It is accordingly
agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to equitable relief, including in
the form of an injunction or injunctions, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the courts in the State of Delaware or in any other court having
competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
any party is entitled at law or in equity. The right to specific performance
shall include the right of the Parties to cause the Contemplated Transactions
to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. The Parties hereto further agree (a) to cooperate fully in any
attempt by the other Parties to obtain any such equitable remedy, (b) to waive
any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with any
such equitable remedy and (c) not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Legal Requirement or
inequitable for any reason, or to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees
that such right of specific performance is an integral part of the
Contemplated Transactions and without that right, the Parties would not have
entered into this Agreement.

 



 

Section 12.13 _Non-Recourse_. No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney or representative of the Seller Parties or their respective
Affiliates shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of
Seller under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

Section 12.14 _Attorney-Client Privilege and Conflict Waiver_. Jones Day has
represented the Company, its Subsidiaries and Seller. All of the Parties
recognize the commonality of interest that exists and will continue to exist
until Closing, and the Parties agree that such commonality of interest should
continue to be recognized after the Closing. Specifically, the Parties agree
that Buyer shall not, and shall not cause any member of the Target Companies
to, seek to have Jones Day disqualified from representing Seller, the Seller
Indemnified Parties and their respective Affiliates in connection with any
dispute that may arise between Seller, the Seller Indemnified Parties or their
respective Affiliates and any of the Buyer Parties or the Company in
connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions and (b) in
connection with any such dispute that may arise between Seller, the Seller
Indemnified Parties or their respective Affiliates and the Buyer Parties or
the Company, Seller, the Seller Indemnified Parties or their respective
Affiliates involved in such dispute (and not the Buyer Parties or the Company)
will have the right to decide whether or not to waive the attorney client
privilege that may apply to any communications between the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries and Jones Day that occurred before the Closing.
