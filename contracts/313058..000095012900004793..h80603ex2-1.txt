                                    THE OFFER

         Section 2.1 The Offer.  (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated pursuant to Section 10.1 hereof, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, but in no event later than five business days following the public
announcement of the terms of this Agreement (which public announcement shall
occur no later than the first business day following the execution of this
Agreement), Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) a tender offer (as it
may be amended from time to time as permitted by this Agreement, the "OFFER") to
purchase all of the shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
(including the related Rights) at a price of U.S.$73.00 per share, net to the
seller in cash (such price, or such higher price per share of Company Common
Stock as may be paid in the Offer, being referred to herein as the "OFFER
PRICE"). The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for shares of
Company Common Stock (including the related Rights) tendered pursuant to the
Offer shall be subject only to the condition that there shall be validly
tendered (other than by guaranteed delivery where actual delivery has not
occurred) in accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to the expiration
date of the Offer and not withdrawn, a number of shares of Company Common Stock
that, together with the shares of Company Common Stock then owned by Parent
and/or Purchaser, represents at least two-thirds of the shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis (after giving effect to the
conversion or exercise of all outstanding options, warrants and other rights to
acquire, and securities exercisable or convertible into, Company Common Stock,
whether or not exercised or converted at the time of determination, other than
potential dilution attributable to the Rights) (the "MINIMUM CONDITION") and to
the satisfaction or waiver by Purchaser as permitted hereunder of the other
conditions set forth in Annex I hereto. The Offer shall be made by means of an
offer to purchase (the "OFFER TO PURCHASE") and the related letter of
transmittal, each in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, containing the
terms set forth in this Agreement and the conditions set forth in Annex I.
Parent and Purchaser agree that the Offer to Purchase will state at least in the
summary term sheet and in appropriate places in the Offer to Purchase that
"Purchaser's obligation to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the
Offer is not conditioned on any financing arrangements or subject to any
financing condition." Without limiting the foregoing, effective upon acceptance
for payment of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer in accordance with
the terms hereof, the holder of such Company Common Stock will sell and assign
to Purchaser all right, title and


                                       10
<PAGE>   15
interest in and to all of the shares of Company Common Stock tendered
(including, but not limited to, such holder's right to any and all dividends and
distributions with a record date before, and a payment date after, the scheduled
or extended expiration date).

         Purchaser expressly reserves the right, subject to compliance with the
Exchange Act, to waive any of the conditions to the Offer and to make any change
in the terms of or conditions to the Offer; provided that (i) the Minimum
Condition may not be waived or changed without the prior written consent of the
Company and (ii) no change may be made that changes the form of consideration to
be paid, decreases the Offer Price, decreases the number of shares of Company
Common Stock sought in the Offer, adds to or modifies any of the conditions to
the Offer set forth in Annex I, makes any other change in the terms of the Offer
that is in any manner adverse to the holders of the Company Common Stock or
(except as provided in the next sentence) changes the expiration date of the
Offer, without the prior written consent of the Company. Without the consent of
the Company, Purchaser shall have the right to extend the expiration date of the
Offer (which shall initially be 20 business days from the commencement date of
the Offer), (i) if, at the scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer,
any of the conditions to the Offer shall not have been satisfied or, to the
extent permitted, waived, until such conditions are satisfied or waived, (ii)
for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of
the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer or any period required by
applicable law, (iii) for up to 10 additional business days in increments of not
more than two business days each (but in no event beyond the Termination Date),
if, immediately prior to the scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer,
the Company Common Stock tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
constitutes more than 80% and less than 90% of the outstanding Company Common
Stock, notwithstanding that all conditions to the Offer are satisfied as of such
expiration date of the Offer, or (iv) as contemplated in Section 10.1(c)(i);
provided, that, in the case of any extension under clause (iii), Parent or
Purchaser may not thereafter assert the failure of any of the conditions
provided for in clauses (a)(iii), (a)(iv), (a)(v) and (b)(ii) of Annex I or, for
purposes of clause (b)(iii) or (c) of Annex I, a Company Material Adverse Effect
or a material breach of a representation or warranty, in each such case, by
reason of an event other than a breach of a covenant by the Company occurring
after the initial extension under clause (iii). In addition, if, at the
scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer, the Minimum Condition has
been satisfied but Company Common Stock tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer constitutes less than 90% of the outstanding Company Common Stock,
without the consent of the Company, Purchaser shall have the right to provide
for a "subsequent offering period" (as contemplated by Rule 14d-11 under the
Exchange Act) for up to 20 business days after Purchaser's acceptance for
payment of the shares of Company Common Stock then tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer.


                                       11
<PAGE>   16
         If any of the conditions to the Offer is not satisfied or waived on any
scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer, Purchaser shall, and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer, if such condition or conditions
could reasonably be expected to be satisfied, from time to time until such
conditions are satisfied or waived; provided, that Purchaser shall not be
required to extend the Offer beyond, and in the case of clause (z) may terminate
the Offer upon, the earliest to occur of (x) the Termination Date, (y) ten
business days following satisfaction of the condition provided for in clause (a)
(ii) of Annex I or (z) five business days following the public announcement of
any Takeover Proposal or amended Takeover Proposal that has not been publicly
rejected by the Company at the time of such expiration or termination (except
that Purchaser may not terminate the Offer pursuant to this clause (z) prior to
the twentieth business day following commencement of the Offer). Subject to the
foregoing and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer,
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause it to, accept for payment and pay for,
as promptly as practicable after the expiration of the Offer (or as required by
Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act), all shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

         (a) On the date hereof and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
Parent shall issue a joint press release with the Company (the "JOINT PRESS
RELEASE") regarding this Agreement and its intent to make the Offer and shall
file with the SEC the Joint Press Release, under cover of Schedule TO,
indicating on the front of such Schedule TO that such filing contains
pre-commencement communications.

         (b) As soon as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including
the exhibits thereto, the "SCHEDULE TO") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule
TO will include as exhibits the Offer to Purchase and forms of the letter of
transmittal, summary advertisement and all other ancillary documents
(collectively, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "OFFER
DOCUMENTS"). Parent and Purchaser will take all steps necessary to cause the
Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock
to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent, Purchaser
and the Company each agree promptly to correct any information provided by it
for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect. Parent and Purchaser
agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents as so corrected to be disseminated to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO
and the Offer Documents prior to their being filed with the SEC or disseminated
to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock. Purchaser and Parent also
agree to provide


                                       12
<PAGE>   17
the Company and its counsel in writing with any comments Purchaser, Parent or
their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
TO or the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall
consult with and provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the response of Purchaser to such comments prior to
responding.

         Section 2.2 Company Action. (a) The Company hereby approves of and
consents to the Offer and represents that its Board of Directors, at a meeting
duly called and held, has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair
to the Company's shareholders and are in the best interests of the Company and
its shareholders, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the
requirements of the LBCL and (iii) resolved to recommend acceptance of the Offer
and, to the extent required by applicable law, approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger by its shareholders. The Company further represents
that Lehman Brothers Inc. has delivered to the Company's Board of Directors its
oral opinion (to be promptly confirmed in writing) that the consideration to be
paid in the Offer and the Merger is fair to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates) from a financial point
of view. The Company has been advised that all of its directors who own shares
of Company Common Stock intend to tender their shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer and the Company has not been advised by any of its
executive officers who owns shares of Company Common Stock that such executive
officer does not intend to tender his or her shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer. In connection with the Offer, the Company will, or will
cause its transfer agent to, promptly furnish Parent with a list of its
shareholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of shares of Company
Common Stock and lists in the Company's possession or control of securities
positions of shares of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories, in each
case as of a recent date, and will provide to Parent such additional information
(including updated lists of shareholders, mailing labels and lists of securities
positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in
connection with the Offer. Subject to the requirements of applicable Laws, and,
except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Schedule TO and the
Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser shall hold
in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files,
shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger,
and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, destroy all
copies of such information then in their possession, except to the extent that
such information can be shown to have been previously known on a nonconfidential
basis by Parent or Purchaser, in the public domain through no fault of Parent or
Purchaser or later lawfully acquired by Parent or Purchaser on a
non-confidential basis.

         (b) On the date hereof and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
the Company shall issue the Joint Press Release with Parent and shall file with
the SEC the Joint Press Release, under cover of Schedule 14D-9, indicating on
the front of such Schedule 14D-9 that such filing contains pre-commencement
communications.

         (c) As soon as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced, the
Company shall file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "SCHEDULE 14D-9") that
shall reflect the recommendations of the Company's Board of Directors referred
to in Section 2.2(a) above. The Company, Parent and Purchaser each agree
promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated
to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior
to its being filed with the SEC. The Company also agrees to provide Parent and
its counsel in writing with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the
receipt of such comments and shall consult with and provide Parent and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the response of the
Company to such comments prior to responding.

         Section 2.3 Directors. (a) Promptly upon the purchase of and payment
for not less than a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock on a fully diluted basis by Parent or any of its direct or indirect
Subsidiaries pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall be entitled to designate for
appointment or election to the Company's Board of Directors, upon written notice
to the Company, such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number,
on the Board of Directors such that the percentage of its designees on the Board
shall equal the percentage of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on
a fully diluted basis purchased and paid for by Parent and its direct or
indirect Subsidiaries. In furtherance thereof, the Company shall, upon request
of Purchaser, use its reasonable best efforts promptly to cause Parent's
designees (and any replacement designees in the event that any designee shall no
longer be on the Board of Directors) to be so elected to the Company's Board,
and in furtherance thereof, to the extent necessary, increase the size of the
Board of Directors or use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the resignation
of such number of its current directors as is necessary to give effect to the
foregoing provision. At such time, the Company shall also, upon the request of
Purchaser, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Persons designated by
Parent to constitute


                                       14
<PAGE>   19
at least the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the
Company's Board of Directors of (i) each committee of the Company's Board of
Directors, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Subsidiary of
the Company and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board (or,
with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) in the case of the Partnership, such
percentage of the number of directors as the Company is entitled to designate on
such board (or similar body) or committee). Notwithstanding the foregoing, until
the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have at least
three directors who are directors of the Company on the date of this Agreement
and who are not officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the
"INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS"); provided, however, that (x) notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the requirement to have at least three Independent
Directors result in Parent's designees constituting less than a majority of the
Company's Board of Directors unless Parent shall have failed to designate a
sufficient number of Persons to constitute at least a majority and (y) if the
number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below three for any reason
whatsoever (or if immediately following consummation of the Offer there are not
at least three then-existing directors of the Company who (1) are Qualified
Persons (as defined below) and (2) are willing to serve as Independent
Directors), then the number of Independent Directors required hereunder shall be
reduced to equal the number of then-serving Independent Directors, unless the
remaining Independent Director or Independent Directors are able to identify a
person or persons, as the case may be, who are not officers or Affiliates of the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries (any such person being
referred to herein as a "QUALIFIED PERSON") willing to serve as an Independent
Director, in which case such remaining Independent Director or Independent
Directors shall be entitled to designate any such Qualified Person or Persons to
fill such vacancies, and such designated Qualified Person shall be deemed to be
an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement, or if no Independent
Directors then remain, the other Directors shall be entitled to designate three
Qualified Persons to fill such vacancies, and such persons shall be deemed to be
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement.

         The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order
to fulfill its obligations under this Section 2.3(a), including mailing to
shareholders the information required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1
(which the Company shall mail together with the Schedule 14D-9 if it receives
from Parent and Purchaser the information below on a basis timely to permit such
mailing) as is necessary to enable Parent's designees to be elected to the
Company's Board of Directors. The Company's obligations to appoint Parent's
designees to the Company's Board of Directors shall be subject to compliance
with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder.
Parent or Purchaser shall supply the Company in writing any information with
respect to either of them and their nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates
required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary in connection with
the appointment of any of


                                       15
<PAGE>   20
Parent's designees under this Section 2.3(a). The provisions of this Section
2.3(a) are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that Purchaser, Parent
or any of their Affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of shares of
Company Common Stock as a matter of law with respect to the election of
directors or otherwise.

         (b) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees
pursuant to Section 2.3(a), the approval by affirmative vote or written consent
of a majority of the Independent Directors then in office (or, if there shall be

                                   ARTICLE IV

                            CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

         Section 4.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any
shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Purchaser:

         (a) Purchaser Capital Stock. Each share of capital stock of Purchaser
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

         (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Purchaser-Owned Stock. All
shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company, any Subsidiary of
the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; provided that shares of
Company Common Stock held beneficially or of record by any Company Stock Plan
not be deemed to be held by the Company regardless of whether the Company has,
directly or indirectly, the power to vote or control the disposition of such
shares.

         (c) Exchange of Shares of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company
Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section
4.1(b) and any


                                       18
<PAGE>   23
shares that are held by shareholders exercising dissenters' rights pursuant to
Section 131 of the LBCL ("DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERS")) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive the Offer Price in cash, payable to the holder thereof, without interest
(the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"), upon surrender of the certificate formerly
representing such share in the manner provided in Section 4.2. All such shares,
when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 4.2, without interest.

         Section 4.2 Exchange of Certificates.

         (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United States or any state
thereof and located therein reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent
for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger
(the "PAYING AGENT") to receive in trust the funds to which holders of such
shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 4.1(c). At the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in U.S. dollars in an amount
sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration as provided herein. The Paying Agent
shall invest such funds as directed by the Surviving Corporation on a daily
basis; provided that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to the Company's shareholders pursuant to this Article IV. Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall replace any monies lost through an investment
made pursuant to this Section 4.2. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be the exclusive property of and shall be paid promptly
to the Surviving Corporation.

         (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "CERTIFICATES"),
whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 4.1 into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other
agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share formerly
represented by such Certificate and the Certificate so surrendered shall


                                       19
<PAGE>   24
forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.2, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 4.2.
The right of any shareholder to receive the Merger Consideration shall be
subject to and reduced by any applicable withholding Tax obligation.

         (c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares of
Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of the shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing
ownership of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable
Law, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares
of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior
to the date of this Agreement and that remain unpaid at the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Article IV.

         (d) Termination of Fund; No Liability. At any time following six months
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require
the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and that
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders
shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with
respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.


                                       20
<PAGE>   25
         Section 4.3 Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if any Dissenting Shareholder shall demand to be paid
the fair cash value of such holder's shares of Company Common Stock, as provided
in Section 131 of the LBCL, such shares shall not be converted into or be
exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration except as
provided in this Section 4.3, and the Company shall give Parent notice of any
written objections to this Agreement or the Merger under Section 131 of the LBCL
received by the Company and of any demands received by the Company for the fair
cash value of any shares of Company Common Stock and Parent shall have the right
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands. Neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment. If any Dissenting
Shareholder shall fail to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
the right to dissent, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such Dissenting
Shareholder shall thereupon be treated as though such shares had been converted
into the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 4.1.

         Section 4.4 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall
deliver the Merger Consideration for each of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate.

         Section 4.5 Company Stock Plans. (a) The Company, the Company's Board
of Directors and each relevant committee of the Company's Board of Directors
shall (i) cause each Stock Option that is outstanding upon consummation of the
Offer, whether granted under any Company Stock Plan, or otherwise, to become
fully exercisable and (ii) take action to permit each such Stock Option to be
exercisable for a period (the "OPTION EXERCISE PERIOD") beginning promptly
following the acceptance for payment and purchase of shares of Company Common
Stock by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer and ending on the day prior to the
Effective Time in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company Stock
Plans. For purposes of each Stock Option, the Company shall cause the Company's
Board of Directors or each relevant committee of the Company's Board of
Directors acting as administrator of each such Company Stock Plan to determine
prior to the consummation of the Offer that the consummation of the Offer and
the Merger constitute a single "Change in Control" occurring at time of
acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer.
The Company shall cause each Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time to be cancelled in exchange for an amount in cash, payable
at the Effective Time, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Stock Option and (ii) the excess, if


                                       21
<PAGE>   26
any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Stock
Option. The Company, the Company's Board of Directors or the relevant committee
of the Company's Board of Directors acting as administrator of a Company Stock
Plan, as appropriate, shall obtain the written consent of the holder of each
Stock Option to such cancellation, if required in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Company Stock Plans. Subject to having obtained any necessary
consents from the holders of Stock Options, the Company shall cause the
Company's Board of Directors or each relevant committee of the Company's Board
of Directors to make any amendments to the Company Stock Plans or stock option
agreements thereunder which may be needed or desirable to implement such
cancellation.

         (b) Except as provided in the next sentence, all Company Stock Plans
shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other Company
Benefit Plan (as hereinafter defined) or any other plan providing for the
issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of the Company or any interest
in respect of any capital stock of the Company shall be deleted as of the
Effective Time, and the Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time
no holder of a Stock Option or any participant in any Company Stock Plan or
Company Benefit Plan or any other plan shall have any right thereunder to
acquire any capital stock of the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and Section 4.5(a), (i) promptly following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall take all action
necessary to terminate each of the Phantom Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan
for Non-employee Directors and the 1999 Phantom Stock Plan for Non-employee
Directors as promptly as practicable in accordance with their respective terms
(but in no event shall such termination occur later than the fifth day after the
date of this Agreement) and for shares of Company Common Stock to be distributed
to the participants in such plans in accordance with their terms, and (ii) the
consummation of the Offer shall constitute a "change of control" under the 1999
Restricted Stock Grants Plan and the related agreements, and the shares of
Company Common Stock issued thereunder shall become Transferable Shares (as
provided therein) and shall be delivered to the participants in such plan in
accordance with their terms.

         (c) The Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause
the transactions contemplated by this Section 4.5, insofar as they relate to any
individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in accordance
with the No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.

                         DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES; STANDARDS
                       FOR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         Section 5.1 Disclosure Schedules. Prior to the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, the Company has delivered to Parent, and Parent has delivered
to the Company, a schedule (in the case of the Company, the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE," and in the case of Parent, the "PARENT DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE") setting
forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which the Company or Parent,
as the case may be, desires or is required to make either in response to an
express disclosure requirement contained in a provision of this Agreement or as
an exception to one or more of such party's representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in Article VI, in the case of the Company, or
Article VII, in the case of Parent and Purchaser, or to one or more of such
party's covenants contained in Article VIII. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary (a) no such item is required to be set forth in the
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty (other than
the representations and warranties contained in Sections 6.1(a), 6.1(c), 6.1(d),
6.2, 6.3, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.15, 6.17, 6.18, 6.19, 6.23, 7.1, 7.2, 7.4 and 7.5) if
its absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being
deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard established by Section 5.2, and
(b) the mere inclusion of an item in a Disclosure Schedule in response to an
express disclosure requirement or as an exception to a representation, warranty
or covenant shall not be deemed an admission by a party that such item is
material or represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case
may be.

         Section 5.2 Standards. No representation or warranty of the Company
contained in Article VI (other than the representations and warranties contained
in Sections 6.1(a), 6.1(c), 6.1(d), 6.2, 6.3, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.15, 6.17, 6.18,
6.19 and 6.23) or of Parent and Purchaser in Article VII (other than the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.4 and 7.5)
shall be deemed untrue or incorrect for any purpose under this Agreement or the
Offer and no party hereto shall be deemed to have breached any such
representation or warranty for any purpose under this Agreement, in any case as
a consequence of the existence or absence of any fact, circumstance or event
unless such fact, circumstance or event, individually or when taken together
with all other facts, circumstances or events inconsistent with any such
representations or warranties contained in Article VI, in the case of the
Company, or Article VII, in the case of Parent and Purchaser, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent
Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

         Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company
represents and warrants to, and covenants and agrees with, Parent and Purchaser
as set forth below in this Article VI. Each exception set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedule and each other response to this Agreement set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedule is identified by reference to, or has been grouped
under a heading referring to, a specific individual Section of this Agreement,
provided, however, that any such exception or response made with reference to
one or more Sections of this Agreement shall be deemed to be made with respect
to each other Section of this Agreement to which such exception or response is
relevant provided that such relevance is reasonably apparent based on the
information set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule.

         Section 6.1 Due Organization, Good Standing and Power. (a) The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, and each such
Person has all requisite corporate (or partnership, as applicable) power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business
as now being conducted. The Company (i) has filed with the United States Coast

         (d) The respective certificates or articles of incorporation and
by-laws or other organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company
that are not wholly owned (directly or indirectly) by the Company do not contain
any provision limiting or otherwise restricting the ability of the Company to
control such Subsidiaries. Section 6.1(d) of the Company Disclosure


                                       24
<PAGE>   29

perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by the Company, and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated
hereby, have been duly authorized and approved by its Board of Directors and no
other corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval, if necessary, and the filing of the Certificate of
Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due and valid authorization, execution and delivery of this

exercise price for all Stock Options is set forth in Section 6.3 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. All issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable and free from preemptive rights. Except for the Company's

warrants, rights, subscriptions, agreements, obligations, convertible or

other equity interests or any securities convertible into, exchangeable for, or
evidencing the right to subscribe for, any shares of the capital stock or other
equity interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each an "ISSUANCE
OBLIGATION"). There are no outstanding obligations of the Company to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding securities of the Company. The
Company has no authorized or outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness


                                       25

exchangeable into or exercisable for securities the holders of which have the
right to vote) with the shareholders of the Company on any matter ("VOTING
DEBT"). There are no restrictions (other than restrictions under state
corporation statutes or similar laws) of any kind which prevent or restrict the

or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other ownership interests.

         (b) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each

all such shares are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from
preemptive rights. No Subsidiary of the Company has outstanding Voting Debt and
there are no obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to

Subsidiaries or any capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, any of
its Subsidiaries.

         (c) Except for the Company's interest in its Subsidiaries, the Company
does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any
interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or
similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited
liability company or other business association or entity which is material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

         (d) No indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries contains

<PAGE>   32
with the SEC by the Company and, to the extent applicable, its Subsidiaries have

did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Section 6.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains

to date between the Company and the SEC, other than routine transmittal letters.

         (b) The Financial Statements (i) comply as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC, (ii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes or

consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of operations and changes
in shareholders' equity and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in
the case of unaudited interim statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

         (c) Except as set forth on the Balance Sheet, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or obligation of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), in each case that is required by
GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, except for (i) liabilities and obligations in
connection with this Agreement and fees and expenses related thereto, and (ii)
liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice which would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default in respect of the
terms and conditions of any indebtedness or other agreement which would
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 6.6 Information to Be Supplied. (a) Each of the Schedule 14D-9
and the Proxy Statement and the other documents required to be filed by the

SEC thereunder and will not, on the date of its filing or, in the case of the
Proxy Statement, on the date it is mailed to shareholders of the Company and at
the time of the Company Shareholder Meeting, and none of the written information
supplied or to be


                                       28
<PAGE>   33
supplied by the Company expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents will at the time the Schedule TO or the
Offer Documents are filed with the SEC and first published, sent or given to the
Company's shareholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading.

         (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.6, no
representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements
made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 14D-9
based on information supplied by Parent or Purchaser expressly for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein or based on information which is not included
in or incorporated by reference in such documents but which should have been
disclosed pursuant to Section 7.4.

         Section 6.7 Absence of Certain Events. Except as explicitly disclosed
in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement or as
required or expressly permitted by this Agreement, since December 31, 1999 the
Company and its Subsidiaries have in all material respects operated their
respective businesses only in the ordinary course and there has not occurred (i)
any event, change, occurrence, effect, fact, circumstance or condition which
would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect; and (ii) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has taken any of the actions described in Sections 8.2(b)(3), (5),
(6), (7), (9), (10), (14) or (17).

         Section 6.8 Litigation. Except as explicitly disclosed in the Company
SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, there are no
investigations, actions, suits or proceedings pending against the Company or its
Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company
or its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective properties, rights or
franchises), at law or in equity, or before or by any federal, state, local or
foreign commission, board, bureau, agency, regulatory or administrative
instrumentality or other Governmental Authority or any arbitrator or arbitration
tribunal. The Company does not have Knowledge of any valid basis for any action,
proceeding or investigation. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to any judgment, order or decree entered in any lawsuit or proceeding.

         Section 6.9 Title to Properties; Encumbrances; Leases. (a) The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries has good, valid and indefeasible title to all of
its tangible properties and assets, with full right to convey; in each case
subject to no Liens, except for (A) Liens reflected in the Balance Sheet, (B)
Liens consisting of zoning or planning restrictions, easements, permits and
other restrictions or limitations on the use of real property or irregularities
in title thereto which do not detract from the value of, or impair the use of,
such property by the Company or any of its


                                       29
<PAGE>   34
Subsidiaries in the operation of their respective businesses and (C) Liens for
current Taxes, assessments or governmental charges or levies on property not yet
due or which are being contested in good faith. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has granted any options or rights of first refusal or rights of
first offer to third parties to purchase or otherwise acquire an interest in any
of its tangible properties and assets. All properties and assets reflected in
the Balance Sheet have an aggregate fair market and realizable value at least
equal to the aggregate value thereof as reflected therein. Section 6.9 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all appraisals of the material
tangible properties and assets received by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries within the last three years, true, correct and complete copies of
which have been made available to Purchaser.

         (b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has valid leasehold
interests in each of its leased premises (collectively, the "TENANT LEASES"). To
the Company's Knowledge, each Tenant Lease is in full force and effect, no
notice of any default has been delivered by any landlord under any of the Tenant
Leases and there are no facts which would now or with the giving of notice or
the passage of time or both be a default under the terms of any of the Tenant
Leases. To the Company's Knowledge, there are no pending claims by any tenant as
to premises leased to tenants by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "LANDLORD LEASES") and there are no pending claims by such
tenants for offsets against rent or other monetary claims made by tenants
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in its capacity as landlord.

         Section 6.10 Compliance with Laws. Except with respect to Taxes, which
are the subject of Section 6.13, environmental matters, which are the subject of
Section 6.16, employee benefits matters, which are the subject of Section 6.11,
and labor matters, which are the subject of Section 6.22, and except as
explicitly disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this
Agreement:

         (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have complied and are
presently complying with all applicable Laws, and neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received written notification of any asserted present or
past failure to so comply.

         (b) The Company and its Subsidiaries hold, to the extent legally
required, all federal, state, local and foreign permits, approvals, licenses,
authorizations, certificates, rights, exemptions and orders from Governmental
Authorities (the "PERMITS") that are required for the operation of the
respective businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries as now conducted.


                                       30
<PAGE>   35
         (c) To the Company's Knowledge, each of its and its Subsidiaries'
tangible properties and assets is in compliance with all applicable Laws,
including, without limitation, all Laws with respect to zoning, building, fire

         Section 6.11 Company Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Section 6.11(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true, complete and correct list of each
bonus, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock purchase, stock
option, restricted stock, phantom stock, severance or termination pay,
hospitalization or other medical, life or other insurance, supplemental
unemployment benefits, profit-sharing, pension, or retirement plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, each individual employment, severance, consulting and
similar contract and each other employee benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, sponsored, entered into, maintained or contributed to or required
to be contributed to (at any time during the past six years) by the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or by any trade or business, whether or not incorporated (an
"ERISA AFFILIATE"), that together with the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder ("ERISA"), for the benefit of any
current or former employee, consultant or director of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate (the "COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS"). Section
6.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each of the Company
Benefit Plans that is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code (the "TITLE IV PLANS").

         (b) There has not been any adoption or amendment by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of any Company Benefit Plan since
December 31, 1999. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any
ERISA Affiliate has any formal plan or commitment to create any additional
Company Benefit Plan or modify or change (except for any modification or change
required or permitted by this Agreement after the date hereof) any existing
Company Benefit Plan that would affect any current or former employee,
consultant or director of the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate.

         (c) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has made
available to Parent (i) a true, complete and correct copy thereof (including all
amendments thereto), as well as true, complete and correct copies of the annual
reports, if required under ERISA, with respect thereto for the last three
completed plan years; (ii) the actuarial reports, if required under ERISA, with
respect thereto for the last three completed plan years; (iii) the two most
recent reports prepared with respect thereto in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employer's Accounting for Pensions, if
required; (iv) the most recent Summary Plan Description, together with each
Summary of Material Modifications, if required under ERISA with respect thereto;
(v) if the Company Benefit Plan is funded through a trust or any third party


                                       31
<PAGE>   36
funding vehicle, the trust or other funding agreement (including all amendments
thereto) and the latest financial statements thereof; and (vi) the most recent
determination letter received from the Internal Revenue Service, if any, with
respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as from time to time amended
(the "CODE").

         (d) With respect to each Title IV Plan, no liability under Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists
that presents a risk to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of
incurring a liability under such Title or Section, other than liability for
premiums due to the PBGC (which premiums have been timely paid when due).
Insofar as the representation made in this Section 6.11(d) applies to Sections
4064, 4069 or 4204 of Title IV of ERISA, it is made with respect to any employee
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement subject to Title IV of ERISA to
which the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate made, or
was required to make, contributions during the five-year period ending on the
last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the Closing Date. The PBGC
has not instituted proceedings to terminate any Title IV Plan and no condition
exists that presents a material risk that such proceedings will be instituted.

         (e) Neither the Company, nor any Subsidiary of the Company, nor any
ERISA Affiliate, nor any Company Benefit Plan, nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any trust created thereunder, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction in connection with
which the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, any
Company Benefit Plan, any such trust, or any trustee or administrator thereof,
could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or
Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or Section
4976 of the Code.

         (f) All contributions which the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company
or an ERISA Affiliate are required to make with respect to each Company Benefit
Plan have been made or properly accrued on the Company's consolidated balance
sheet in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 87.
With respect to each Title IV Plan, the present value of accrued benefits under
such plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the
most recent actuarial report prepared by such plan's actuary with respect to
such plan did not exceed, as of its latest valuation date, the then current
value of the assets of such plan allocable to such accrued benefits. There has
been no amendment to, written interpretation of or announcement (whether or not
written) by the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate
relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Company
Benefit Plan that would increase materially the expense of maintaining such


                                       32
<PAGE>   37
Plan above the level or expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recent
fiscal year ended prior to the date hereof.

         (g) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan," as such
term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. With respect to any Company Benefit
Plan that is a multiemployer pension plan, (i) neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has made or suffered a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial
withdrawal," as such terms are respectively defined in Sections 4203 and 4205 of
ERISA (or any liability resulting therefrom has been satisfied in full), (ii) to
the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred that presents a material
risk of a partial withdrawal, (iii) neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
has any contingent liability under Section 4204 of ERISA, and (iv) to the
Knowledge of the Company, no circumstances exist that present a material risk
that any such plan will go into reorganization. There would be no aggregate
withdrawal liability of the Company and its ERISA Affiliates if a complete
withdrawal by the Company and the ERISA Affiliates had occurred on the date
hereof.

         (h) Each Company Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in
accordance with its terms and applicable law, including but not limited to ERISA
and the Code.

         (i) Each Company Benefit Plan which is intended to be "qualified"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service that such plan is so
qualified and the trusts maintained thereunder are exempt from taxation under
Section 501(a) of the Code, and such letter takes into account all plan mergers
and/or amendments and any changes in applicable law requiring amendments to
relevant Company Benefit Plans, except to the extent that the time for making
such amendments has not yet expired. No event has occurred since the date of any
such letter which could adversely affect such qualified or exempt status.


         (j) No Company Benefit Plan provides death or medical benefits (whether
or not insured), with respect to current or former employees of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate beyond their retirement or other termination
of service (other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable law, (ii) death
benefits or retirement benefits under any "employee pension plan," as that term
is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, or (iii) benefits the full cost of which is
borne by the current or former employee (or his beneficiary)).

         (k) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and/or any related event) will
not (i) entitle any current or former employee, consultant, director or officer
of the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to
severance pay, or any other payment from the Company, any such Subsidiary or
ERISA Affiliate, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or


                                       33
<PAGE>   38
increase the amount of compensation due any such employee, consultant, director
or officer, or (iii) require the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate to fund or make any payments to any trust or other funding
vehicle in respect of any Company Benefit Plan.

         (l) No amounts payable under the Company Benefit Plans will fail to be
deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 162(a)(1),
162(m) or 280G of the Code.

         (m) There are no pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened claims by, on behalf of or against any Company Benefit Plan, by any
current or former employee (or beneficiary) covered under any such Company
Benefit Plan, or otherwise involving any such Company Benefit Plan (other than
routine claims for benefits).

         (n) There are no outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock or other awards relating to or based on the Company Common
Stock.

         (o) Each Company Benefit Plan relating to employees not employed in the
United States (i) is in compliance with all requirements of Law applicable
thereto and the respective requirements of the governing documents of such plan
and (ii) is fully and properly funded in accordance with, and the assets thereof
are held by a person authorized to hold such assets under, applicable Law and
regulation and the governing documents of such plan.

         Section 6.12 Books and Records. The books of account, minute books,
stock record books and other records of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the
Company have been maintained in accordance with sound business practices and the
requirements of Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act. The Company has made
available to Parent the complete minute books of the Company for all periods
after December 31, 1994, and such minute books contain true and correct records
of all corporate action taken by the shareholders, the Company Board of
Directors and committees of the Company Board of Directors since December 31,
1994, and no meeting of any of such shareholders, the Company Board of Directors
or such committees has been held for which minutes have not been prepared and
are not contained in such minute books.

         Section 6.13 Taxes. Except as explicitly disclosed in the Company SEC
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement:

         (a) Tax Returns. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has timely
filed or caused to be timely filed with the appropriate taxing authorities all
returns, statements, forms and reports for federal income and other Taxes (as
hereinafter defined) ("RETURNS") that are required to be filed by, or with
respect to, the Company and such Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date.


                                       34
<PAGE>   39
The Returns as filed were true, correct and complete and accurately reflect all
liability for Taxes for the periods covered thereby. "TAXES" shall mean all
taxes, assessments, charges, duties, fees, levies or other governmental charges
including, without limitation, all federal, state, local, foreign and other
income, franchise, profits, capital gains, capital stock, transfer, sales, use,
value-added, occupation, property, excise, severance, windfall profits, stamp,
license, payroll, withholding and other taxes, assessments, charges, duties,
fees, levies or other governmental charges of any kind whatsoever (whether
payable directly or by withholding and whether or not requiring the filing of a
Return), all estimated taxes, and all deficiency assessments, additions to tax,
penalties and interest with respect thereto and shall include any liability for
such amounts as a result either of being a member of a combined, consolidated,
unitary or affiliated group or of a contractual obligation to indemnify, any
Person. The federal income tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries have
been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (or the applicable statutes of
limitation for the assessment of federal income Taxes for such periods have
expired) for all periods through and including December 31, 1996.

         (b) Payment of Taxes. All Taxes and liabilities for Taxes of the
Company and its Subsidiaries that have become due and payable have been timely
paid or fully provided for as a liability on the Financial Statements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP.
Since the date of the Balance Sheet, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course
of business.

         (c) Other Tax Matters. No deficiencies for any Taxes have been asserted
or assessed against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which are not fully
reserved for or which are not being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings. No Governmental Authority is presently conducting a tax audit or
investigation with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or has
asked in writing for an extension or waiver of an applicable statute of
limitations. With respect to Taxes or any Return, no power of attorney has been
executed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. To the Company's Knowledge,
there is no dispute or claim concerning any liability for Taxes of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary either claimed or raised by any taxing authority in
writing.

         (d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a member
of any affiliated group within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code, or
any similar affiliated or consolidated group for tax purposes under state, local
or foreign law (other than a group the common parent of which is the Company),
or has any liability for Taxes of any Person (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law as a transferee or successor, by
contract or otherwise.


                                       35
<PAGE>   40
         (e) All Taxes which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is (or was)
required by law to withhold or collect have been duly withheld or collected, and
have been timely paid over to the proper authorities to the extent due and
payable.

         (f) There are no Tax sharing, allocation, indemnification or similar
agreements (in writing) in effect as between the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any predecessor or Affiliate of any of them and any other party
under which the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) could be liable for any
Taxes of any party other than the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.

         (g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
agreement, plan, contract or arrangement that could result, separately or in the
aggregate, in a payment of any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code.

         (h) No election under Section 341(f) of the Code has been made or shall
be made prior to the Closing Date to treat the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a consenting corporation, as defined in Section 341 of the Code.

         (i) No transaction contemplated by this Agreement is subject to
withholding under Section 1445 of the Code.

         (j) There are no Liens for Taxes upon any property or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for Liens for Taxes not yet due or
for which adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP.

         (k) No unresolved claim has been made by any taxing authority in a
jurisdiction where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not pay Taxes or
file Returns that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to
Taxes assessed by such jurisdiction.

         Section 6.14 Intellectual Property. The Company and its Subsidiaries
own, or are validly licensed or otherwise have the right to use in the manner

violate the contractual obligation of the Company or its Subsidiary to any third
party to maintain the confidentiality of such information; provided, however,
that with respect to any information covered by this clause (ii), the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of any such third party
to such disclosure; provided, further, however that this clause (ii) shall not
limit or restrict any obligation of the Company to disclose information to
Parent pursuant to Section 8.5 or Section 10.1(c)(i). All information exchanged

         liability for Taxes that in either case is material;

                  (18) permit any insurance policy naming it as a beneficiary or
         a loss payable payee to be cancelled or terminated, other than pursuant
         to an expiration in accordance with its terms, unless a new policy with

         cancellation or termination, except policies providing coverage for
         losses not in excess of U.S.$250,000; or

                  (19) agree or commit, in writing or otherwise, to take any of
         the foregoing actions.

For purposes of this Section 8.2(b) (other than Section 8.2(b)(13)), references

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

         (c) The Company (i) shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, take any action that would, or would reasonably be expected to,
result in (A) any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in Article IX or
Annex I not being satisfied (subject to the Company's right to take action
specifically permitted by Section 8.5) or (B) a Company Material Adverse Effect
and (ii) shall not knowingly take, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to take,
any action that would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in any of its
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement becoming untrue in
any respect.

Statement. Subject to Section 2.4, as promptly as practicable following the

its Board of Directors, shall, in accordance with applicable law:

         (a) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of
its shareholders (the "COMPANY SHAREHOLDER MEETING") for the purpose of
considering and taking action upon the approval of the Merger and the adoption
of this Agreement;

         (b) prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy or information
statement in accordance with the Exchange Act relating to the Merger and this
Agreement and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and furnish the
information required to be included by the Exchange Act and the SEC in the Proxy
Statement (as hereinafter defined) and, after consultation with Parent, to
respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the preliminary
proxy or information statement and cause a definitive proxy or information
statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto (the "PROXY
STATEMENT"), to be mailed to its shareholders, provided that no amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without
consultation with Parent and its counsel;

         (c) include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Board of
Directors of the Company that shareholders of the Company vote in favor of

<PAGE>   57


         (d) use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its shareholders
proxies, and to take all other action necessary and advisable, to secure the
vote of shareholders required by applicable law and the Company's Articles of
Incorporation or By-Laws to obtain the approval for this Agreement and the
Merger.

         Section 8.4 Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification. (a) Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Offer and
the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
(i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from any Governmental Authority and the making of all necessary

any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Authority, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other

consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes
of, this Agreement; provided, however, that no loan agreement or contract for
borrowed money entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
repaid except as currently required by its terms, in whole or in part, and no
contract shall be amended to increase the amount payable thereunder or otherwise
to be more burdensome to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in order to
obtain any such consent, approval or authorization without first obtaining the
written approval of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld).
Nothing contained in this Section 8.4(a) shall prohibit the Company and its
Subsidiaries from taking any action permitted by Section 8.5 or from terminating
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1. In addition to the obligations set
forth above, the Company shall cooperate with Parent's reasonable requests in
connection with Parent's efforts to finalize the financing, on terms reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, necessary to provide Parent and Purchaser with
sufficient funds to purchase at the Offer Price all of the shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis, including the Company's
providing financial statements and financial and other business information
reasonably required to be disclosed by Parent in connection therewith.

         (b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of (i) any
representation or warranty made by the Company contained in this Agreement
becoming untrue or incorrect, subject to the standard established in Section 5.2
where applicable (including its receiving


                                       53
<PAGE>   58
Knowledge of any fact, event or circumstance which may cause any representation
qualified as to its Knowledge to be or become untrue or incorrect, subject to
the standard established in Section 5.2 where applicable ) in any respect that
would cause the condition to the Offer set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of Annex I
hereto to fail to be satisfied; or (ii) the failure by the Company to comply
with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however,
that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the Company or the conditions to the obligations of
the parties under this Agreement. The Company acknowledges that if after the
date of this Agreement the Company receives Knowledge of any fact, event or
circumstance that would cause any representation or warranty that is conditioned
as to the Knowledge of the Company to be or become untrue or incorrect (subject
to the standard established in Section 5.2, where applicable, and (in the case
of representations or warranties not subject to such standard), subject to such
representation or warranty becoming untrue or incorrect in any material
respect), the receipt of such knowledge shall mean that such representation or
warranty shall be deemed to have become untrue or incorrect as of the date of
such receipt.

         (c) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of (i) any
representation or warranty made by Parent contained in this Agreement becoming
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure by Parent or
Purchaser to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement; provided that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of Parent or Purchaser or the conditions to
the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

         Section 8.5 No Solicitation. (a) The Company shall, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
financial advisors, attorneys and other advisors, representatives and agents to,
immediately cease any existing activities, discussions or negotiations conducted
with any parties other than Parent or Purchaser with respect to any Takeover
Proposal (as defined below). The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or
permit any of its Affiliates to, nor shall it authorize or permit any officer,
director or employee of or any financial advisor, attorney or other advisor,
representative or agent of it or any of its Affiliates, to (i) directly or
indirectly solicit, facilitate, initiate or encourage the making or submission
of, any Takeover Proposal (including, without limitation, the taking of any
action which would make Section 133 of the LBCL inapplicable to a Takeover
Proposal), (ii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with
respect to any Takeover Proposal or enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding requiring it to abandon or terminate this Agreement or to fail to
consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
(iii) initiate or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish or disclose to any Person (other than a party to this Agreement) any
information with respect to, or


                                       54
<PAGE>   59
take any other action to facilitate or in furtherance of any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Takeover Proposal, or (iv) grant any waiver or release under any
standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of the Company's
equity securities (other than to permit the Company to receive a Takeover
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 8.5(a)); provided
that prior to the acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer, in response to a Takeover Proposal that did not result
from the breach of this Section 8.5 and following delivery to Parent of notice
of the Takeover Proposal in compliance with its obligations under Section 8.5(d)
hereof, the Company may participate in discussions or negotiations with or
furnish information (pursuant to a confidentiality/standstill agreement with
customary terms as reasonably determined in good faith by the Company after
consultation with outside counsel; provided that each such agreement is at least
as limiting as any such agreement between Parent and the Company) to any third
party which has made a bona fide written Takeover Proposal if (A) the Company's
Board of Directors reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor) that taking such action would be reasonably likely to
lead to the delivery to the Company of a Superior Proposal and (B) the Company's
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that it is necessary to take such actions in order to comply with
its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section
8.5(a) directly or indirectly by any of its, or any of its Subsidiaries',
officers, Affiliates or directors or any advisor, representative, consultant or
agent retained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not such Person
is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall
constitute a breach of this Section 8.5(a) by the Company. The Company will take
all actions necessary or advisable to inform the appropriate individuals or
entities referred to in the prior sentence of the obligations undertaken in this
Section 8.5. For purposes of this Section 8.5, a Person shall be deemed to have
facilitated or encouraged an action or result only if any act or omission by

any of its Subsidiaries or 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer

substantial portion of the assets, recapitalization, liquidation or a

and "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means a bona fide written Takeover Proposal made by a
third party to purchase all of the outstanding equity securities of the Company
pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger or other business combination
(x) on terms which the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith to
be superior to the Company and its shareholders (other than Parent, Purchaser
and their respective Affiliates), in their capacity as shareholders, from a
financial point of view (taking into account, among other things, all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and identity of the
offeror and the financial capacity of the offeror to consummate the transaction)
as compared to the transactions contemplated hereby and any alternative proposed
by Parent or Purchaser in accordance with Section 10.1(c) hereof, such
determination having been made only after consultation with the Company's
financial advisor, (y) which is reasonably capable of being consummated and (z)
for which financing is committed, and which financing is no more conditional
than Parent's financing at that time (taking into account whether any of the
conditions to Parent's financing shall have been satisfied at that time).

         (b) The Company agrees that, except as set forth in Section 8.5(c),
neither its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent
or Purchaser, the approval or recommendation of the Company's Board of Directors
of the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement, unless the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel, that such withdrawal or modification is necessary in order to satisfy
its fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable law, (ii)
approve or recommend, or, in the case of a committee, propose publicly to the
Board of Directors to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal or (iii)
approve, recommend or cause it to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (each, an
"ACQUISITION AGREEMENT") related to any Takeover Proposal. For purposes of this
clause (b), if any such board or committee proposal is publicly disclosed,
regardless of the source of, or the circumstances surrounding, the disclosure,
such board or committee proposal shall be deemed to have been made publicly.

         (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the
acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer,
the Company and/or its Board of Directors may take the actions otherwise
prohibited by Sections 8.5(a) and 8.5(b) if (i) a third party makes a Superior
Proposal, (ii) the Company complies with its obligations under Section 8.5(d),
(iii) all of the conditions to the Company's right to terminate this Agreement

expiration of the five business day period described therein (or such shorter
period as may be provided therein) and the payment of all amounts required
pursuant to Section 10.3 hereof) and (iv) simultaneously therewith, this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 10.1(c)(i) hereof.

Company set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 8.5, promptly
after (but in no event more than 24 hours after) receipt thereof, the Company
shall advise Parent in writing of any request for information or any Takeover
Proposal, or any inquiry, discussions or negotiations with respect to any
Takeover Proposal, and the material terms and conditions of such request,
Takeover Proposal, inquiry, discussions or negotiations, and the Company shall
promptly provide to Parent copies of any written materials received by the
Company in connection with any of the foregoing, and the identity of the Person
or group making any such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry or with whom any
discussions or negotiations are taking place. The Company agrees that it shall
simultaneously provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the
Company provided to any other Person or group in connection with any Takeover
Proposal which was not previously provided to Parent.

8.5 shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with respect to any tender offer or from making any required
disclosure to the Company's shareholders if, in the reasonable good faith
judgment of the Company's Board of Directors, after consultation with outside
counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its disclosure
obligations under applicable Law.

         Section 8.6 Antitrust Laws. (a) Each party hereto shall (i) take
promptly (but in no event later than 10 days following the date of this
Agreement as to initial filings) all actions necessary to make the filings
required of it or any of its Affiliates under any applicable Antitrust Laws in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
comply at the earliest practicable date with any formal or informal request for
additional information or documentary material received by it or any of its

with resolving any investigation or other inquiry concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement initiated by any Antitrust Authority.

         (b) Each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve
such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law; provided, however, that
the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, commit to
any divestiture transaction and Parent shall not be required to divest or hold
separate or otherwise take or commence to take any action that, in the
reasonable discretion of Parent, materially limits its ability to conduct the
business or its ability to retain, the Company or any of its affiliates or any
material portion of the assets of the Company.


                                       57

         (c) Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other parties of any
material communication made to, or received by such party from, any Antitrust
Authority or any other Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

         (d) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "ANTITRUST AUTHORITIES" means
the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice, the attorneys general of the several states of the United States and
any other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to applicable Antitrust Laws and (ii)
"ANTITRUST LAW" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended,
the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other
federal, state and foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines, and other laws that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect
of monopolization or restraint of trade.

         Section 8.7 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.
(a) Parent, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation agree that all rights to
indemnification existing in favor of the present or former directors, officers,
employees, fiduciaries and agents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") for acts or omissions of such Persons
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the Company's
Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws or the certificate or articles of
incorporation, by-laws or similar organizational documents of any of the
Subsidiaries or the terms of any individual indemnity agreement or other
arrangement with any director or executive officer, which agreement or
arrangement is listed in Section 8.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in each
case as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect for six years after the Effective Time
(without modification or amendment, except as required by applicable law) in
accordance with their terms, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and shall
be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties against the Surviving Corporation, and
the Surviving Corporation shall also advance fees and expenses (including
reasonable attorney's fees) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law.

         (b) Purchaser shall cause to be maintained in effect for not less than
six years from the Effective Time the current policies of the directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Purchaser
may substitute therefor policies of at least equivalent coverage containing
terms and conditions which are no less advantageous) with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time, provided that in no event shall Purchaser
or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend to maintain or procure
insurance coverage pursuant to this Section 8.7 any amount per annum in excess
of 200% of the amount currently expended by the Company (the "MAXIMUM PREMIUM"),
which annual amount currently


                                       58
<PAGE>   63
expended is $492,500. In the event the payment of the Maximum Premium for any
year is insufficient to maintain such insurance or equivalent coverage cannot
otherwise be obtained, Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase as
much insurance as may be purchased for the amount indicated; provided, however,
if such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, the Surviving Corporation
shall purchase coverage for all available extended reporting periods with
respect to pre-existing insurance in an amount which, together with all other
insurance purchased pursuant to this Section 8.7(b), does not exceed the Maximum
Premium. The provisions of this Section 8.7 shall survive the consummation of
the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the Indemnified
Parties.

         (c) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to, or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers,
directors or employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this Section 8.7 is not prior to or in substitution for any such
claims under such policies.

         Section 8.8 Public Announcements. The initial press release with
respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release
acceptable to Parent and the Company. Thereafter, Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation and review by the other party of such
release or statement, except as may be required by Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with a national securities
exchange, or as may be permitted pursuant to Section 8.5.

         Section 8.9 Option to Acquire Additional Shares. (a) The Company hereby
grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the "OPTION") to purchase up to that
number of newly issued shares of Company Common Stock (the "OPTION SHARES")
equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the
number shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Purchaser and its
Affiliates immediately following consummation of the Offer, shall constitute one
share more than 90% of the shares of Common Company Stock then outstanding on a
fully diluted basis (after giving effect to the issuance of the Option Shares)
for a consideration per Option Share equal to the Offer Price.

         (b) Such Option shall be exercisable only within 5 business days
following the purchase of and payment for shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer by Parent or Purchaser as a result of which Parent and its
Affiliates own beneficially at least 80% of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock on a fully diluted basis. Such Option shall not


                                       59
<PAGE>   64
be exercisable if (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
thereto exceeds the number of authorized shares of Company Common Stock
available for issuance, or (ii) the exercise of the Option would violate the
applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange applicable to the Company.

         (c) In the event Purchaser wishes to exercise the Option, Purchaser
shall give the Company a one-day prior written notice of its exercise of the
Option specifying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are or will
be beneficially owned by Parent, Purchaser and its Affiliates immediately
following consummation of the Offer and a place and a time (which may be
concurrent with the consummation of the Offer) for the closing of such purchase.
The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of the notice,
deliver written notice to Purchaser specifying the number of Option Shares. At
the closing of the purchase of the Option Shares, the portion of the purchase
price owing upon exercise of such Option which equals the product of (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to such Option
multiplied by (y) the Offer Price shall be paid to the Company in cash by wire
transfer or cashier's check.

         Section 8.10 Rights Agreement. Except as contemplated by this Agreement
or approved in writing by Parent, the Company's Board of Directors shall not:
(a) amend the Rights Agreement, (b) redeem or exchange, or resolve to redeem or
exchange, the Rights, (c) permit a "Distribution Date" to occur under the Rights
Agreement, or (d) take any action except as provided in clause (c) with respect
to, or make any determination under, the Rights Agreement, except, in each case,
to the extent necessary to comply with the fiduciary obligations of the
Company's Board of Directors, as determined by it in good faith after
consultation with outside counsel.

         Section 8.11 Vessels Engaged in Coastwise Trade. (a) Prior to
consummation of the Offer, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, take all actions necessary to transfer to the Company any
vessels engaged in the coastwise trade owned by such Subsidiaries, including the
Southdown Conquest (Official Number 236823) and Steelton (Official Number
243587) (other than the Southdown Challenger (Official Number 202859)(the
"SHIP")), to the Company, and shall obtain all consents, permits and licenses
associated therewith, in each such case without incurring tax payments (other
than those occasioned by termination of the capital construction fund) by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or restrictions on operation of such vessels
materially different than those restrictions in place as of the date hereof.

         (b) Prior to consummation of the Offer, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to (i)(A) sell or transfer the Ship to a citizen of the
United States, which citizen is designated by Parent and entitled to register
the Ship in unrestricted coastwise trade, and (B)


                                       60
<PAGE>   65
enter into a leaseback or time charter agreement on terms approved by Parent
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and in compliance with
United States maritime law or (ii) subject to Parent's approval (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld), make such other arrangements (which may
include a sale, other transfer or disposal, lease or charter, including a
transfer to a trust that is qualified under 46 U.S.C. Section 12102(d)(2)) and
agreements with respect to the Ship as may be necessary to permit the purchase
of shares of Company Common Stock by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer without
contravention of the United States citizenship and other requirements of United
States maritime law, without incurring tax payments (other than those occasioned
by termination of the capital construction fund) by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or restrictions on operation of such vessels materially different
than those restrictions in place as of the date hereof.

         Section 8.12 Employee Benefits Plans. (a) From and after the
Measurement Date, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
shall honor in accordance with their respective terms (as in effect on the date
of this Agreement), all the Company's written employment, severance and
termination agreements, plans and policies existing prior to the execution of
this Agreement which are between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
director, officer or employee thereof and which have been disclosed in Section
8.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Parent acknowledges and agrees that (i)
consummation of the Offer would constitute a "Change in Control" (or the similar
relevant defined term) for all purposes pursuant to those agreements and
arrangements indicated on Section 8.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and
(ii) consummation of the Merger would constitute "good reason" under those
agreements and arrangements indicated in Section 8.12(a)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

         (b) For a period of not less than six months following the Measurement
Date, Parent shall, unless the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries at
the Measurement Date (the "COMPANY EMPLOYEES") shall otherwise agree or
different terms are negotiated with the relevant union representing such
employees, cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to the Company Employees
employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those
provided immediately prior to the Measurement Date to Company Employees;
provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 8.12 shall require
Parent or Purchaser to continue or replace, or cause to be continued or
replaced, any Company Stock Plan or other Company Benefit Plan after the
Measurement Date.

         (c) Subject to compliance with Section 8.12(a), nothing contained in
this Section 8.12 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent
the termination of employment of any Company Employee or any change in the
compensation or employee benefits available to


                                       61
<PAGE>   66
any Company Employee or the amendment or termination of any particular Company
Benefit Plan to the extent permitted by its terms as in effect immediately prior
to the Measurement Date.

         (d) For all purposes under any employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee after the Effective
Time, other than Parent's employee stock option plan (the "PARENT OPTION PLAN")
(all such employee benefit plans, other than the Parent Option Plan, are
hereinafter referred to as the "New Plans"), each such Company Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries
before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company
Benefit Plans for purposes of (i) eligibility to participate and (ii) vesting,
but in no event shall such service be taken into account in determining the
accrual of benefits under any New Plan, including, but not limited to, a defined
benefit plan. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(x) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan replaces coverage under a comparable benefit plan of the Company in which
such employee participated immediately before the Effective Time and which plans
were previously disclosed to Parent and (y) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions of such New
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents (other
than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to
such employees and dependents and that have not been satisfied as of the
Effective Time), and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Company Benefit Plan ending on the date such employee's participation in
the corresponding New Plan begins, to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

         Section 8.13 Definitive Financing Agreements. Prior to the close of
business on the earlier to occur of the expiration date of the Offer (as it may
be extended by Purchaser as permitted by this Agreement) and 60 days following
the date hereof (the "DELIVERY DATE"), Parent and Purchaser agree to (a) execute
and deliver definitive financing agreements (the "DEFINITIVE FINANCING
AGREEMENTS") (i) pursuant to which financial institutions agree to provide to
Parent and/or Purchaser funds which, when taken together with cash otherwise
available to Parent and/or Purchaser, will constitute Sufficient Funds to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer in accordance with its terms and (ii) with conditions to funding no more
onerous in the aggregate to Parent and Purchaser than those


                                       62
<PAGE>   67
contemplated by the Commitment Letters and (b) deliver true, complete and
correct copies of the Credit Agreements to the Company.

                                   ARTICLE IX

Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer in breach of their obligations under
this Agreement.

to by Parent; and

         (b) the Option Exercise Period shall have commenced and shall have been
in effect for at least 30 consecutive days as of the day immediately prior to

and effect as of the Effective Time.

                                    ARTICLE X

                           TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT

         Section 10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Company Shareholder

         or Purchaser is then in material breach of any representation,
         warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement);

                  (ii) if at any time prior to the acceptance for payment of
         shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, (A) the Company,

         into any agreement, other than a confidentiality/standstill agreement
         permitted under Section 8.5, with respect to any Takeover Proposal
         other than the Offer or the Merger, (x) amended, conditioned,
         qualified, withdrawn, modified or contradicted, or, in the case of a
         committee, publicly proposed to the Board of Directors, or resolved to
         do any of the foregoing, in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser,
         its approval and recommendation of the Offer, the Merger and this
         Agreement (regardless of whether such action was permitted under this
         Agreement), (y) approved or recommended, or, in the case of a
         committee, publicly proposed to the Board


                                       64

         or amended Takeover Proposal within five business days following the
         public announcement of such Takeover Proposal or amendment (except that
         Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (z)
         prior to the twentieth business day following commencement of the
         Offer), or (B) the Company or the Company's Board of Directors or any
         committee thereof shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing (it
         being understood and agreed that for purposes of this Section
         10.1(b)(ii), if any board or committee proposal is publicly disclosed,
         regardless of the source of, or the circumstances surrounding, the
         disclosure, such board or committee proposal shall be deemed to have
         been made publicly); or

                  (iii) if the Company breaches in any material respect its
         obligations under Section 8.5 hereof;

         (c) by the Company,


                  (i) if at any time prior to the acceptance for payment of
         shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (A) a Superior
         Proposal is received by the Company and (B) the Board of Directors of
         the Company reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation
         with outside counsel) that it is necessary to terminate this Agreement
         and enter into an agreement to effect the Superior Proposal in order to
         comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under
         applicable law; provided that the Company may not terminate this
         Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(c)(i) unless and until (x) five
         business days have elapsed following delivery to Parent of a written
         notice of such determination by the Board of Directors of the Company
         and during such five business day period the Company has fully
         cooperated with Parent, including, without limitation, informing Parent
         of the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and the identity
         of the Person making such Superior Proposal, with the intent of
         enabling both parties to agree to a modification of the terms and
         conditions of this Agreement so that the transactions contemplated
         hereby may be effected; (y) at the end of such five business day period
         the Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and
         the Board of Directors of the Company confirms its determination (after
         consultation with outside counsel) that it is necessary to terminate
         this Agreement and enter into an agreement to effect the Superior
         Proposal to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and
         (z) (1) at or prior to such termination, Parent has received the
         Termination Fee set forth in Section 10.3 hereof by wire transfer in
         immediately available funds and (2) immediately following such
         termination the Company enters into a definitive acquisition, merger or
         similar agreement to effect the Superior Proposal; provided, however,
         that, if the written notice contemplated in clause (x) above is given
         to

         Parent less than five business days, but more than two business days,
         prior to the then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, then the Company
         will be permitted to terminate this Agreement under this Section
         10.1(c)(i) no earlier than 24 hours before such scheduled expiration if
         the Company has complied with all of the requirements of this Section
         10.1(c)(i) (with the five business day period set forth in clauses (x)
         and (y) above being deemed to end when such 24-hour period begins for
         purposes of determining such compliance) unless, prior to the beginning
         of such 24- hour period, Purchaser shall have extended the Offer to a
         date that is at least five business days after the delivery of such
         notice to Parent, in which case the Company's right to terminate this
         Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(c)(i) shall be determined
         without regard to this proviso; provided, further, that it is
         understood and agreed that if the written notice contemplated in clause
         (x) above is given to Parent less than two business days prior to the
         then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, the Company's right to
         terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(c)(i) shall be
         subject to compliance with all of the requirements of this Section
         10.1(c)(i), including the five business day period set forth in clauses
         (x) and (y) hereof without regard to the immediately preceding proviso;
         or

                  (ii) provided the Company is not in material breach of its
         obligations under this Agreement, if Parent or Purchaser shall have (x)
         failed to commence the Offer as provided in Section 2.1, (y) failed to
         pay for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer in
         accordance with Section 2.1 hereof, or (z) breached in any material
         respect any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants
         or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach cannot be
         or has not been cured within 30 days after receipt of notice thereof by
         Parent or by the Termination Date, whichever is earlier; or

                  (iii) if Parent and Purchaser breach their obligation to
         execute and deliver with their financial institutions, and deliver to
         the Company copies of, the Credit Agreements on or prior to the
         Delivery Date; or

         (d) by either Parent or the Company:

                  (i) if the Offer has not been consummated on or before the
         Termination Date; provided that the right to terminate this Agreement
         pursuant to this clause shall not be available to any party whose
         failure to fulfill any material obligation of this Agreement or other
         material breach of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted
         in, the failure of the Offer to have been consummated on or prior to
         the aforesaid date;


                                       66
<PAGE>   71
                  (ii) if, as a result of the failure of any of the conditions
         set forth in Annex I to this Agreement, the Offer shall have terminated
         or expired in accordance with its terms without Purchaser having
         purchased any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer;
         provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
         clause shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any
         material obligation under this Agreement or other material breach of
         this Agreement has resulted in the failure of such condition; or

                  (iii) if any court of competent jurisdiction or any
         Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or
         taken any other action permanently restricting, enjoining, restraining
         or otherwise prohibiting acceptance for payment of, and payment for,
         shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or consummation of
         the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have
         become final and nonappealable.

         Section 10.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by Parent or the Company, as provided in Section 10.1, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability hereunder on the
part of the Company, Parent or Purchaser or their respective officers or
directors (except as set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, this Section
10.2 and Sections 10.3, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 11.8, 11.9, 11.11, 11.12, 11.13 and
11.14, which shall survive the termination); provided, however, that nothing
contained in this Section 10.2 or in Section 10.3 shall relieve any party hereto
from any liability for any breach of this Agreement.

         Section 10.3 Payment of Certain Fees. (a) If this Agreement is
terminated by Parent in accordance with Section 10.1(b)(ii) or Section
10.1(b)(iii) or by the Company pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(i), then the Company
shall pay to Parent in immediately available funds a termination fee in an
amount equal to U.S.$80 million (the "TERMINATION FEE").

         (b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by (A) Parent pursuant to
Section 10.1(b)(i), (B) Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(i), or
(C) Parent or the Company pursuant to clause 10.1(d)(ii) and either the Minimum
Condition or any of the conditions listed in Section (c) of Annex I to this
Agreement shall fail to have been satisfied and (ii)(A) a Takeover Proposal has
been made and publicly announced or communicated to the Company's shareholders
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the effective date of such
termination and (B) concurrently with or within 12 months of the date of such
termination a Third Party Acquisition Event occurs, then the Company shall
within one business day of the occurrence of such a Third Party Acquisition
Event (including any revisions or amendments thereto), if any, pay to Parent the
Termination Fee.


                                       67
<PAGE>   72
         "THIRD PARTY ACQUISITION EVENT" shall mean (i) the consummation of a
Takeover Proposal involving the purchase of a majority of either the equity
securities of the Company or of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any such transaction that, if it had been
proposed prior to the termination of this Agreement would have constituted a
Takeover Proposal or (ii) the entering into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of a definitive agreement with respect to any such transaction.

         (c) Any payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 10.3
shall be made within one business day after termination of this Agreement (or as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds. If the Company fails to pay to Parent the Termination Fee when
due hereunder, the Company shall pay the costs and expenses (including legal
fees and expenses) in connection with any action, including the filing of any
lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment, together with interest
on the amount of any unpaid fee and/or expense at the publicly announced prime
rate for leading money center banks as published in The Wall Street Journal from
the date such fee was required to be paid to the date it is paid.

         Section 11.4 Entire Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement and this
Agreement and the schedules and other documents referred to herein or delivered

inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and, with respect
to the provisions of Section 8.7 hereof, shall inure to the benefit of the

immediately


                                       70
<PAGE>   75
preceding sentence, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended
to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective
successors and permitted assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

         Section 11.6 Amendment and Modification. Subject to applicable law,
this Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in writing by the
parties hereto in all respects before the Effective Time (whether before or
after the Company Shareholder Approval), by action taken by the respective
Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and the Company (or, if required by
Section 2.3, the Independent Directors) or by the respective officers authorized
by such Boards of Directors or the Independent Directors, as the case may be;
provided, however, that after the Company Shareholder Approval, no amendment
shall be made which by law requires further approval by the shareholders of the
Company without such further approval.

         Section 11.7 Further Actions. Each of the parties hereto agrees that,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and subject to its legal
obligations and fiduciary duties, it will use its reasonable best efforts to
fulfill all conditions precedent specified herein, to the extent that such
conditions are within its control, and to do all things reasonably necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

         Section 11.8 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or
Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation". The phrases "the date of this Agreement", "the date hereof" and
terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires, shall be deemed
to refer to September 28, 2000.

         Section 11.9 Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. Each of the parties hereto (a) irrevocably and unconditionally consents
to submit to the jurisdiction of any state court located in the County of New
Castle, State of Delaware (a "State Court") or in the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware (the "Federal Court") for the purpose of any
action arising out of or based upon this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement brought by any party hereto and for the
recognition and enforcement of any judgment rendered in respect thereof, (b)
waives, and agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise,
in any such action, any claim that it is


                                       71
<PAGE>   76
not subject to the personal jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its
assets or property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the
action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action is
improper, or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts and (c)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement in any court
other than a State Court or the Federal Court. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the
Company irrevocably appoints CT Corporation System, 1209 Orange Street, City of
Wilmington, County of New Castle, 19801, as its agent for the sole purpose of
receiving service of process or other legal summons in connection with any
proceedings in the State of Delaware. If the appointment of the person mentioned
in this Section 11.9 ceases to be effective, Parent, Purchaser and the Company
each agrees that it will promptly appoint a further person in the State of
Delaware to accept service of process on its behalf in the State of Delaware and
so notify the other parties to this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section
11.9 shall affect the right to serve process in any other manner permitted by
law.

         Section 11.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which
together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument.

         Section 11.11 Applicable Law. This Agreement and the legal relations
between the parties hereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware (without regard to the conflict of laws rules
thereof), except to the extent that the LBCL is mandatorily applicable to the
Merger.

         Section 11.12 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against
its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

         Section 11.13 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties to this
Agreement hereby irrevocably waives all right to a trial by jury in any action,
proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

         Section 11.14 Parent Guarantee. Parent hereby guarantees the due
performance of any and all obligations and liabilities of Purchaser (or any
assignee of Purchaser) under or arising out of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

of or payments for shares of Company Common Stock.

         Subject to the provisions of the Merger Agreement, the foregoing
conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser and may be asserted
by Purchaser or, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement may be waived by
Parent or Purchaser, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in
the sole discretion of Parent or Purchaser. The failure by Parent or Purchaser
at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver
of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may
be asserted at any time and from time to time.
