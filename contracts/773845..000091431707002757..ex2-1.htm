Code. Following the  Closing, neither OFC, GCB nor any of their affiliates
shall knowingly take  any  action, cause any action to be taken, fail to
take any action or cause any  action to fail to be taken, which action or

Agreement  (ii) there are no adverse Federal or state income tax consequences
to GCB  shareholders as a result of the modification; (iii) the consideration
to be  paid  to the holders of GCB Common Stock under this Agreement is not
thereby changed  in kind, value or reduced in amount; and (iv) such
modification will not delay  materially or jeopardize the receipt of
Regulatory Approvals or other consents  and approvals relating to the
consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger  or  otherwise delay the
Closing or cause any condition to Closing set forth in  Article IX not to be
capable of being fulfilled in a timely  manner. The parties hereto agree to
appropriately amend this  Agreement and any related documents in order to
reflect any such revised  structure, all of which shall be mutually
acceptable to the  parties.

 

 

2.9. _Bank  Merger_

 

 

OFC  and  GCB shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the merger of
GC Bank  with  and into Oritani Savings Bank, with Oritani Savings Bank as

of the  rights, properties or assets of GCB or GC Bank, or (ii) otherwise
carry out  the purposes of this Agreement, GCB and its officers and directors
shall be  deemed to have granted to OFC an irrevocable power of attorney to
execute and  deliver, in such official corporate capacities, all such deeds,
assignments  or  assurances in law or any other acts as are necessary or
desirable to  (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in OFC
its right,  title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties

3.1.5. In  the event OFC changes (or establishes a record date for changing)
the number  of,  or provides for the exchange of, shares of OFC Common Stock
issued and  outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock
split, stock  dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar
transaction (including  any exercise of any Rights by any Person pursuant to
which OFC receives less  than fair market value, which may be measured as of
the date of the grant of  the  Right, for such shares) with respect to the
outstanding OFC Common Stock and  the  record date therefor shall be prior
to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio  shall be proportionately and
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders  of  GCB Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement  prior to such event;
_provided_ , _that_ no such adjustment shall be  made with regard to OFC
Common Stock if OFC issues additional shares of Common  Stock and receives
fair market value consideration for such shares and provided,  further, that
no adjustment shall be made with regard to OFC Common Stock as  a  result of
the grant of equity awards by OFC pursuant to a stockholder approved  plan.

 

 

3.2. _Election  Procedures._

 

 

3.2.1. Holders  of GCB Common Stock may elect to receive shares of OFC Common
Stock or cash  (in  either case without interest) in exchange for their
shares of GCB Common Stock  in accordance with the procedures set forth
herein; provided that, in the  aggregate, and subject to the provisions of
this Section 3.2, 60% of the total  number of shares of GCB Common Stock
issued and outstanding at the Effective  Time, excluding any Non-Exchangeable
Shares (the "Stock Conversion Number"),  shall be converted into the Stock
Consideration and the remaining outstanding  shares of GCB Common Stock shall
be converted

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 


 

into  the  Cash Consideration. Shares of GCB Common Stock as to which a
Cash  Election (including, pursuant to a Mixed Election) has been made are
referred  to  herein as "Cash Election Shares." Shares of GCB Common Stock
as to  which a Stock Election has been made (including, pursuant to a Mixed
Election)  are referred to as "Stock Election Shares." Shares of GCB Common 
Stock as to which no election has been made (or as to which an Election Form 
is  not returned properly completed) are referred to herein as "Non-
Election  Shares." The aggregate number of shares of GCB Common Stock with 
respect to which a Stock Election has been made is referred to herein as the 
"Stock Election Number."

 

 

3.2.2. An  election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials (which  shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to  the  Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of such Certificates to  the  Exchange Agent), in such form as GCB and OFC
shall mutually agree ("Election  Form"), shall be mailed no more than 40
business days and no less than 20  business days prior to the anticipated
Effective Time or on such earlier date  as  OFC and GCB shall mutually agree
(the "Mailing Date") to each holder of record  of GCB Common Stock as of five
business days prior to the Mailing Date (the  "Election Form Record Date").
Each Election Form shall permit such  holder, subject to the allocation and
election procedures set forth in this  Section 3.2, (i) to elect to receive
the Cash Consideration for all of the  shares of GCB Common Stock held by
such holder, in accordance with Section  3.1.3, (ii) to elect to receive the
Stock Consideration for all of such shares,  in accordance with Section
3.1.3, (iii) to elect to receive the Stock  Consideration for a part of such
holder's GCB Common Stock and the Cash  Consideration for the remaining part
of such holder's GCB Common Stock, or (iv)  to indicate that such record
holder has no preference as to the receipt of  cash  or OFC Common Stock for
such shares. A holder of record of shares of  GCB Common Stock who holds such
shares as nominee, trustee or in another  representative capacity (a
"Representative") may submit multiple Election Forms,  provided that each
such Election Form covers all the shares of GCB Common Stock  held by such
Representative for a particular beneficial owner. Any  shares of GCB Common
Stock with respect to which the holder thereof shall not,  as of the Election
Deadline, have made an election by submission to the Exchange  Agent of an
effective, properly completed Election Form shall be deemed  Non-Election
Shares.

 

 

3.2.3. To  be effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be
submitted to the  Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., New Jersey time, on
the 20th day following  the  Mailing Date (or such other time and date as
OFC and GCB may mutually agree)  (the "Election Deadline"); provided,
however, that the Election Deadline may not  occur on or after the Closing
Date. GCB shall use its reasonable best  efforts to make available up to two
separate Election Forms, or such additional  Election Forms as OFC may
permit, to all persons who become holders (or  beneficial owners) of GCB
Common Stock between the Election Form Record Date  and  the close of
business on the business day prior to the Election  Deadline. GCB shall
provide to the Exchange Agent all information  reasonably necessary for it to
perform as specified herein. An  election shall have been properly made only
if the Exchange Agent shall have  actually received a properly completed and
duly executed Election Form by the  Election Deadline. An Election Form shall
be deemed properly  completed only if accompanied by one or more Certificates
(or customary  affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or
destruction of such  Certificates (including delivery by electronic book-
entry form) or the  guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing
all shares of GCB Common  Stock covered by such Election Form, together with
duly executed transmittal  materials included with the Election Form. If an

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 


 

GCB  shareholder either (i) does not submit a properly completed Election
Form in  a  timely fashion or (ii) revokes its Election Form prior to the
Election Deadline  (without later submitting a properly completed Election
Form prior to the  Election Deadline), the shares of GCB Common Stock held by
such shareholder  shall be designated as Non-Election Shares. Any Election
Form may be  revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form
to the Exchange  Agent by written notice to the Exchange Agent only if such
notice of revocation  or change is actually received by the Exchange Agent at
or prior to the Election  Deadline. OFC shall cause the Certificate or
Certificates relating to  any revoked Election Form to be promptly returned
without charge to the person  submitting the Election Form to the Exchange
Agent. Subject to the  terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the
Exchange Agent shall  have  discretion to determine when any election,
modification or revocation is  received and whether any such election,
modification or revocation has been  properly made. All elections shall be
revoked automatically if the  Exchange Agent is notified in writing by OFC or
GCB, upon exercise by OFC or  GCB  of its respective or their mutual rights
to terminate this Agreement to the  extent provided under Article XI, that
this Agreement has been terminated in  accordance with Article XI and OFC
shall cause all Certificates to be promptly  returned without charge to all
persons submitting Election Forms to the Exchange  Agent.

 

 

3.2.4. If  the aggregate number of shares of GCB Common Stock with respect to
which Stock  Elections shall have been made (the "Stock Election Number")
exceeds the Stock  Conversion Number, then all Cash Election Shares and all
Non-Election Shares  of  each holder thereof shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash  Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each
holder thereof will be  converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration in respect of that  number of Stock Election Shares equal to
the product obtained by multiplying  (x)  the number of Stock Election
Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction,  the  numerator of which is
the Stock Conversion Number and the denominator of which  is the Stock
Election Number, with the remaining number of such holder's Stock  Election
Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash  Consideration.

 

 

3.2.5.   If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion
Number (the  amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock
Election Number  being referred to herein as the "Shortfall Number"), then
all Stock Election  Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration  and  the Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares
shall be treated in the  following manner:

 

 

(A) If  the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares,  then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive  the  Cash Consideration and the Non-Election Shares of
each holder thereof shall  convert into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration in respect of that  number of Non-Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying  (x)  the number of Non-Election Shares held
by such holder by (y) a fraction, the  numerator of which is the Shortfall
Number and the denominator of which is  the  total number of Non-Election
Shares, with the remaining number of such holder's  Non-Election Shares being
converted into the right to receive the Cash  Consideration; or

 

 

(B) If  the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
all  Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock  Consideration and Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof shall
convert  into  the right to

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 


 

receive  the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election
Shares equal  to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash
Election Shares  held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of
which is the amount  by  which (1) the Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the
total number of Non-Election  Shares and the denominator of which is the
total number of Cash Election Shares,  with the remaining number of such
holder's Cash Election Shares being converted  into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration.

 

 

3.2.6. _No  Fractional Shares._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained  herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
OFC Common  Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, no  dividend or distribution with respect to OFC Common Stock
shall be payable  on or  with respect to any fractional share interest, and
such fractional share  interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote
or to any other rights  of  a shareholder of OFC. In lieu of the issuance of
any such fractional  share, OFC shall pay to each former holder of GCB Common
Stock who otherwise  would be entitled to receive a fractional share of OFC
Common Stock, an amount  in cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without
interest, equal to the product  of (i) the fraction of a share to which such
holder would otherwise have been  entitled and (ii) the OFC Market Value. For
purposes of determining  any fractional share interest, all shares of GCB
Common Stock owned by a GCB  shareholder shall be combined so as to calculate
the maximum number of whole  shares of OFC Common Stock issuable to such GCB
shareholder.

 

 

3.3. _Procedures  for Exchange of GCB Common Stock._

 

 

3.3.1. _OFC  to Make Merger Consideration Available._ After the Election 
Deadline and no later than the Closing Date, OFC shall deposit, or shall
cause  to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the
holders of  GCB  Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section
3.3, certificates  representing the shares of OFC Common Stock and an
aggregate amount of cash  sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash
payable pursuant to this Article  III (including any cash that may be payable
in lieu of any fractional shares  of  GCB Common Stock) (such cash and
certificates for shares of OFC Common Stock,  together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, being  hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund").

 

 

3.3.2. _Exchange  of Certificates_. OFC shall take all steps necessary to
cause the  Exchange Agent, within five (5) business days after the Effective
Time, to  mail  to each holder of a Certificate or Certificates (other than
those holders who  submitted to the Exchange Agent all Certificates held by
such holder pursuant  to  a properly completed Election Form, which was not
revoked), a form letter of  transmittal for return to the Exchange Agent and
instructions for use in  effecting the surrender of the Certificates for the
Merger Consideration and  cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, into
which the GCB Common Stock  represented by such Certificates shall have been
converted as a result of the  Merger. The letter of transmittal shall specify
that delivery shall  be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only  upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent. Upon proper surrender  of a Certificate for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, pursuant  to a properly completed
Election Form or letter of transmittal, duly executed,  the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange  therefor, as
applicable, (i) a certificate representing that number of shares  of  OFC
Common Stock (if any) to which such former holder of GCB Common Stock shall 
have

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 


 

become  entitled pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1 or 3.2 hereof,
(ii) a check  representing that amount of cash (if any) to which such former
holder of GCB  Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the
provisions of Section  3.1 or 3.2 hereof and (iii) a check representing the
amount of cash (if any)  payable in lieu of fractional shares of OFC Common
Stock, which such former  holder has the right to receive in respect of the
Certificate surrendered  pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.2, and the
Certificate so surrendered  shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on  the cash payable in lieu of fractional shares.
Certificates  surrendered for exchange by any person who is an "affiliate" of
GCB for purposes  of Rule 145(c) under the Securities Act shall not be
exchanged for certificates  representing shares of OFC Common Stock until OFC
has received the written  agreement of such person contemplated by Section
8.4 hereof.

 

 

3.3.3. _Rights  of Certificate Holders after the Effective Time_. The holder
of a  Certificate that prior to the Merger represented issued and outstanding
GCB  Common Stock shall have no rights, after the Effective Time, with
respect to  such GCB Common Stock except to surrender the Certificate in
exchange for the  Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. No
dividends or  other distributions declared after the Effective Time with
respect to OFC Common  Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate until the  holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in
accordance with this Section  3.3. After the surrender of a Certificate in
accordance with this  Section 3.3, the record holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive any such  dividends or other distributions, without any
interest thereon, which  theretofore had become payable with respect to
shares of OFC Common Stock  represented by such Certificate.

 

 

3.3.4. _Surrender  by Persons Other than Record Holders_. If the Person
surrendering  a Certificate and signing the accompanying letter of
transmittal is not the  record holder thereof, then it shall be a condition
of the payment of the Merger  Consideration that: (i) such Certificate is
properly endorsed to such  Person or is accompanied by appropriate stock
powers, in either case signed  exactly as the name of the record holder
appears on such Certificate, and is  otherwise in proper form for transfer,
or is accompanied by appropriate evidence  of the authority of the Person
surrendering such Certificate and signing the  letter of transmittal to do so
on behalf of the record holder; and (ii) the  person requesting such exchange
shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance  any  transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the payment to a person other  than  the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other  reason, or
shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such  tax has
been paid or is not payable.

 

 

3.3.5. _Closing  of Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no  transfers on the stock transfer books of GCB of the GCB Common
Stock that were  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the  Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are
presented for transfer  to the Exchange Agent, they shall be exchanged for
the Merger Consideration  and  canceled as provided in this Section 3.3.

 

 

3.3.6. _Return  of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the six (6) month
period after the  Effective Time, OFC shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver  to it any portions of the Exchange Fund which had
been made available to the  Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Certificates (including, without  limitation, all interest and other income

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 


 

received  by the Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available to
it), and  thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to OFC (subject
to abandoned  property, escheat and other similar laws) with respect to any
Merger  Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates held  by  them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither OFC nor
the Exchange Agent shall  be  liable to any holder of a Certificate for any
Merger Consideration delivered  in  respect of such Certificate to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned  property, escheat or other similar law.

 

 

3.3.7. _Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate  shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit  of  that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or  destroyed and, if required by OFC, the posting by such person of a
bond in  such  amount as OFC may reasonably direct as indemnity against any
claim that may  be  made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue  in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger  Consideration deliverable in respect thereof.

 

 

3.3.8. _Withholding._ OFC  or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the  consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement or the transactions  contemplated hereby to any holder of GCB
Common Stock such amounts as OFC (or  any Affiliate thereof) or the Exchange
Agent are required to deduct and withhold  with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any applicable  provision of U.S. federal, state,
local or non-U.S. tax law. To the  extent that such amounts are properly
withheld by OFC or the Exchange Agent,  such withheld amounts will be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as  having been paid to the holder of the
GCB Common Stock in respect of whom such  deduction and withholding were made
by OFC or the Exchange Agent.

 

 

3.3.9. _Treatment  of GCB Options_. GCB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.3.1 sets forth
all of  the outstanding GCB Options as of the date hereof. Prior to and 
effective as of the Effective Time, GCB shall take all actions necessary to 
terminate the GCB Stock Benefit Plans. Holders of all unexercised GCB 
Options as of the Effective Time will be entitled to receive, in
cancellation  of  their GCB Options, a cash payment from GCB immediately
prior to the Effective  Time, in an amount equal to the product of (x) the
number of shares of GCB  Common Stock provided for in such GCB Option
(whether vested or unvested) and  (y) the excess, if any, of $21.40 over the
exercise price per share provided  for  in such GCB Option (the "Cash Option
Payment"), which cash payment shall be  treated as compensation and shall be
net of any applicable federal or state  withholding tax. At the time of
receipt of such cash payment, each  holder of a GCB Option shall acknowledge
in writing that such cash payment  is in  full satisfaction of such holder's
rights under such GCB Option.

 

 

3.3.10. _Reservation  of Shares._ OFC shall reserve for issuance a sufficient
number of  shares of the OFC Common Stock for the purpose of issuing shares
of OFC Common  Stock to the GCB shareholders in accordance with this Article
III.

 

 

3.3.11. _Book  Entry._ Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement,  the Election Form and the letter of transmittal may, at the
option of OFC,  provide for the ability of a holder of one or more
Certificates to elect that  the OFC Common Stock be received in exchange

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 


 

for  the  GCB Common Stock formerly represented by such surrendered
Certificates be issued  in book-entry form.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

4.6. _Financial  Statements._

 

 

4.6.1. GCB  has previously made available to OFC the GCB Regulatory Reports.
The  GCB Regulatory Reports have been prepared in all material respects in
accordance  with applicable regulatory accounting principles and practices
throughout the  periods covered by such statements.

 

 

4.6.2. GCB  has previously made available to OFC the GCB Financial 
Statements. The GCB Financial Statements have been prepared in  accordance
with GAAP, and (including the related notes where applicable) fairly  present
in each case in all material respects (subject in the case of the  unaudited
interim statements to normal year-end adjustments), the consolidated 
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of GCB and the GCB 
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of and for the respective periods
ending  on the dates thereof, in accordance with GAAP during the periods
involved,  except as indicated in the notes thereto, or in the case of
unaudited  statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q.

 

 

4.6.3. At  the date of each balance sheet included in the GCB Financial
Statements or  the  GCB Regulatory Reports, neither GCB nor GC Bank, as
applicable, had any  liabilities, obligations or loss contingencies of any
nature (whether absolute,  accrued, contingent or otherwise) of a type
required to be reflected in such  GCB  Financial Statements or GCB
Regulatory Reports or in the footnotes thereto  which  are not fully
reflected or reserved against

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

22  

 

 

 

 


 

therein  or fully disclosed in a footnote thereto, except for liabilities,
obligations  and loss contingencies which are not material individually or in
the aggregate  or which are incurred in the ordinary course of business,
consistent with past  practice, and except for liabilities, obligations and
loss contingencies which  are within the subject matter of a specific
representation and warranty herein  and subject, in the case of any unaudited
statements, to normal, recurring  audit  adjustments and the absence of
footnotes.

 

 

4.6.4. The  records, systems, controls, data and information of GCB and its
Subsidiaries  are  recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic,  mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under  the exclusive ownership and direct
control of GCB or its Subsidiaries or  accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for  any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control that would not reasonably  be  expected to have a
material adverse effect on the system of internal accounting  controls
described below in this Section 4.6.4. GCB (x) has  implemented and maintains
a system of internal control over financial reporting  (as required by Rule
13a-15(a) of the Exchange Act) that is designed to provide  reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and  the 
preparation of its financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with  GAAP, (y) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures  (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material  information relating to GCB, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, is made  known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of GCB  by  others within those entities, and (z) has
disclosed, based on its most  recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
GCB's outside auditors and the  audit committee of GCB's Board of Directors
(i) any significant  deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal  control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange  Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect GCB's ability to record,  process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud,  whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have  a  significant role in GCB's
internal control over financial reporting. These  disclosures (if any) were
made in writing by management to GCB's auditors and  audit committee and a
copy has previously been made available to OFC. As of  the  date hereof, to
the knowledge of GCB, its chief executive officer and chief  financial
officer will be able to give the certifications required pursuant  to  the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 302 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when next due.

 

 

4.6.5. Since  December 31, 2003, (i) neither GCB nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the  Knowledge of GCB, any director, officer, employee, auditor,
accountant or  representative of GCB or any of its Subsidiaries has received
or otherwise  had  or obtained knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim,  whether written or oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices,  procedures, methodologies or methods of
GCB or any of its Subsidiaries or their  respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint,  allegation, assertion or claim
that GCB or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged  in questionable accounting
or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney  representing GCB or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material  violation of Securities
Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation  by  GCB or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of  Directors of GCB or
any committee thereof or to any director or officer of  GCB.

GCB  and  the GCB Subsidiaries that are at least 80 percent owned by GCB are
members  of  the same affiliated group within the meaning of Code Section
1504(a). GCB has  duly filed all federal, state and material local tax
returns required to be  filed by or with respect to GCB and every GCB
Subsidiary on or prior to the  Closing Date, taking into account any
extensions (all such returns, to GCB's  Knowledge, being accurate and correct
in all material respects) and has duly  paid or made provisions for the
payment of all material federal, state and  local  taxes which have been
incurred by or are due or claimed to be due from GCB  and  any GCB
Subsidiary by any taxing authority or pursuant to any written tax  sharing
agreement on or prior to the Closing Date other than taxes or other  charges
which (i) are not delinquent, (ii) are being contested in good faith,  or 
(iii) have not yet been fully determined. Except as set forth in GCB 
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.7, as of the date of this Agreement, GCB has received 
no written notice of, and to GCB's Knowledge there is no audit examination, 
deficiency assessment, tax investigation or refund litigation with respect 
to  any taxes of GCB or any of its Subsidiaries, and no claim has been made
by  any  authority in a jurisdiction where GCB or any of its Subsidiaries do
not file  tax  returns that GCB or any such Subsidiary is subject to
taxation in that  jurisdiction. Except as set forth in GCB DISCLOSURE 
SCHEDULE 4.7, GCB and its Subsidiaries have not executed an extension or 
waiver of any statute of limitations on the assessment or collection of any 
material tax due that is currently in effect. GCB and each of its
Subsidiaries  has withheld and paid all taxes required to have been withheld
and paid in  connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee,
independent contractor,  creditor, shareholder or other third party, and GCB
and each of its  Subsidiaries, to GCB's Knowledge, has timely complied with
all applicable  information reporting requirements under Part III, Subchapter
A of Chapter  61 of  the Code and similar applicable state and local
information reporting  requirements.

 

 

4.8. _No  Material Adverse Effect._

 

 

GCB  has  not suffered any Material Adverse Effect since December 31, 2006
and no event  has occurred or circumstance arisen since that date which, in
the aggregate,  has  had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on  GCB.

 

 

4.9. _Material  Contracts; Leases; Defaults._

 

 

4.9.1. Except  as set forth in GCB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.9.1, neither GCB nor
any GCB  Subsidiary is a party to or subject to: (i) any employment,
consulting or  severance contract or material arrangement with any past or
present officer,  director or employee of GCB or any GCB Subsidiary, except
for "at will" arrangements; (ii) any plan, material arrangement or contract
providing for  bonuses, pensions, options, deferred compensation, retirement
payments, profit  sharing or similar material arrangements for or with any
past or present  officers, directors or employees of GCB or any GCB
Subsidiary; (iii) any  collective bargaining agreement with any labor union
relating to employees  of  GCB or any GCB Subsidiary; (iv) any agreement
which by its terms limits the  payment of dividends by GCB or any GCB
Subsidiary; (v) any instrument evidencing  or related to material
indebtedness for borrowed money whether directly or  indirectly, by way of
purchase money obligation, conditional sale, lease  purchase, guaranty or
otherwise, in respect of which GCB or any GCB Subsidiary  is an obligor to
any person, which instrument evidences or relates to  indebtedness

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

24  

 

 

 

 


 

other  than deposits, repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, bankers'
acceptances, and "treasury tax and loan" accounts and transactions in
"federal funds" in each  case established in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past  practice, or which contains financial covenants or
other restrictions (other  than those relating to the payment of principal
and interest when due) which  would be applicable on or after the Closing
Date to OFC or any OFC Subsidiary;  (vi) any other agreement, written or
oral, that obligates GCB or any GCB  Subsidiary for the payment of more than
$25,000 annually or for the payment  of  more than $50,000 over its
remaining term, which is not terminable without  cause  on 60 days' or less
notice without penalty or payment, or (vii) any agreement  (other than this
Agreement), contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding  (whether
written or oral) that restricts or limits in any material way the  conduct of
business by GCB or any GCB Subsidiary (it being understood that  any  non-
compete or similar provision shall be deemed material).

 

 

4.9.2. Each  real estate lease that requires the consent of the lessor or its
agent resulting  from the Merger or the Bank Merger by virtue of the terms of
any such lease,  is  listed in GCB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.9.2 identifying the
section of the lease  that contains such prohibition or restriction. Subject
to any  consents that may be required as a result of the transactions
contemplated  by  this Agreement, to its Knowledge, neither GCB nor any GCB
Subsidiary is in  default in any material respect under any material
contract, agreement,  commitment, arrangement, lease, insurance policy or
other instrument to which  it  is a party, by which its assets, business, or
operations may be bound or  affected, or under which it or its assets,
business, or operations receive  benefits, and there has not occurred any
event that, with the lapse of time  or  the giving of notice or both, would
constitute such a default.

 

 

4.9.3. True  and correct copies of agreements, contracts, arrangements and
instruments  referred to in Section 4.9.1 and 4.9.2 have been made available
to OFC on or  before the date hereof, and are in full force and effect on the
date hereof  and  neither GCB nor any GCB Subsidiary (nor, to the Knowledge
of GCB, any other  party to any such contract, arrangement or instrument) has
materially breached  any provision of, or is in default in any respect under
any term of, any such  contract, arrangement or instrument, except as set
forth in GCB DISCLOSURE  SCHEDULE 4.9.3. Except as listed on GCB DISCLOSURE 
SCHEDULE 4.9.3, no party to any material contract, arrangement or  instrument
will have the right to terminate any or all of the provisions of  any  such
contract, arrangement or instrument as a result of the execution of, and  the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by, this  Agreement. Except as
set forth in GCB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.9.3, no  plan, contract, employment
agreement, termination agreement, or similar  agreement or arrangement to
which GCB or any GCB Subsidiary is a party or under  which GCB or any GCB
Subsidiary may be liable contains provisions which permit  an employee or
independent contractor to terminate it without cause and continue  to accrue
future benefits thereunder. Except as set forth in GCB  DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE
4.9.3, no such agreement, plan, contract, or arrangement  (x)  provides for
acceleration in the vesting of benefits or payments due thereunder  upon the
occurrence of a change in ownership or control of GCB or any GCB  Subsidiary
or upon the occurrence of a subsequent event; or (y) requires GCB  or  any
GCB Subsidiary to provide a benefit in the form of GCB Common Stock or 
determined by reference to the value of GCB Common Stock.

 

 

4.9.4. Since  December 31, 2006, through and including the date of this
Agreement, except  as set forth in GCB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.9.4, neither GCB
nor any

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

25  

 

 

 

 


 

GCB  Subsidiary has (i) except for (A) normal increases for employees 
(other than officers and directors subject to the reporting requirements of 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act) made in the ordinary course of business 
consistent with past practice, or (B) as required by applicable law, 
increased the wages, salaries, compensation, pension, or other fringe
benefits  or perquisites payable to any executive officer, employee, or

amounts have been  previously made available to OFC), granted any severance
or termination pay,  entered into any contract to make or grant any severance
or termination pay  (except as required under the terms of agreements or
severance plans listed  on  GCB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.1, as in effect as
of the date hereof), or  paid any bonus other than the customary year-end
bonuses in amounts consistent  with past practice, (ii) granted any options
to purchase shares of GCB  Common Stock, or any right to acquire any shares
of its capital stock to any  executive officer, director or employee other
than grants to employees (other  than officers subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the  Exchange Act) made in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past  practice under GCB Stock Benefit
Plans, (iii) increased or established any  bonus, insurance, severance,
deferred compensation, pension, retirement, profit  sharing, stock option

purchase or other employee benefit plan, (iv) made any  material election for
federal or state income tax purposes, (v) made any  material change in the
credit policies or procedures of GCB or any of its  Subsidiaries, the effect
of which was or is to make any such policy or procedure  less restrictive in
any material respect, (vi) made any material  acquisition or disposition of
any assets or properties, or any contract for  any  such acquisition or
disposition entered into other than loans and loan  commitments, (vii)

payments in excess of $50,000, other than in connection with  foreclosed
property or in the ordinary course of business consistent with past 
practice, (viii) changed any accounting methods, principles or practices of 
GCB or its Subsidiaries affecting its assets, liabilities or businesses, 
including any reserving, renewal or residual method, practice or policy or 
(ix) suffered any strike, work stoppage, slow-down, or other labor 
disturbance.

 

 

4.10. _Ownership  of Property; Insurance Coverage._

 

 

4.10.1. Except  as set forth in GCB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.10, GCB and each
GCB Subsidiary  has good and, as to real property, marketable title to all
material assets  and  properties owned by GCB or each GCB Subsidiary in the
conduct of its businesses,  whether such assets and properties are real or
personal, tangible or intangible,  including assets and property reflected in
the balance sheets contained in  the  GCB Regulatory Reports and in the GCB
Financial Statements or acquired  subsequent thereto (except to the extent
that such assets and properties have  been disposed of in the ordinary course
of business, since the date of such  balance sheets), subject to no material
encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security  interests or pledges, except (i)
those items which secure liabilities for  public or statutory obligations or
any discount with, borrowing from or other  obligations to FHLB, inter-bank
credit facilities, or any transaction by an  GCB  Subsidiary acting in a
fiduciary capacity, (ii) statutory liens for amounts  not  yet delinquent or
which are being contested in good faith, (iii) non-monetary  liens affecting
real property which do not materially and adversely affect  the  value or
use of such real property, and (iv) those described and reflected in  the GCB
Financial Statements. GCB and the GCB Subsidiaries, as lessee, have  the 
right under valid and existing leases of real and personal

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

26  

 

 

 

 


 

properties  used by GCB and its Subsidiaries in the conduct of their
businesses to occupy  or  use all such properties as presently occupied and
used by each of  them.

 

 

4.10.2. With  respect to all material agreements pursuant to which GCB or any
GCB Subsidiary  has purchased securities subject to an agreement to resell,
if any, GCB or  such  GCB Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a lien or
security interest (which  to  GCB's Knowledge is a valid, perfected first
lien) in the securities or other  collateral securing the repurchase
agreement, and the value of such collateral  equals or exceeds the amount of
the debt secured thereby.

 

 

4.10.3. GCB  and each GCB Subsidiary currently maintain insurance considered
by each of  them  to be reasonable for their respective operations. Neither
GCB nor any  GCB Subsidiary has received notice from any insurance carrier
during the past  two years that (i) such insurance will be canceled or that
coverage thereunder  will be materially reduced or eliminated, or (ii)
premium costs (other than  with  respect to health or disability insurance)
with respect to such policies of  insurance will be substantially increased.
There are presently no material  claims pending under such policies of
insurance and no notices have been given  by GCB or any GCB Subsidiary under
such policies (other than with respect to  health, disability or worker's
compensation insurance). All such insurance is  valid and enforceable and in
full force and effect in all material respects,  and  within the last two
years GCB and each GCB Subsidiary has received each type  of  insurance
coverage for which it has applied and during such periods has not  been 
denied indemnification for any material claims submitted under any of its 
insurance policies. GCB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.10.3 identifies all material 
policies of insurance maintained by GCB and each GCB Subsidiary.

 

 

4.11. _Legal  Proceedings._

 

 

Except  as  set forth in GCB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.11, neither GCB nor any
GCB  Subsidiary is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to GCB's
Knowledge,  threatened legal, administrative, arbitration or other
proceedings, claims  (whether asserted or unasserted), actions or
governmental investigations or  inquiries of any nature (i) against GCB or
any GCB Subsidiary, (ii) to which  GCB  or any GCB Subsidiary's assets are
or may be subject, (iii) challenging the  validity or propriety of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  or (iv) which could adversely
affect the ability of GCB or GC Bank to perform  under this Agreement,
except, in each of (i) through (iv) above, for any  proceeding, claim,
action, investigation or inquiry which, if adversely  determined,
individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably expected  to have a
Material Adverse Effect on GCB.

 

 

4.12. _Compliance  With Applicable Law._

 

 

4.12.1. To  GCB's Knowledge, and except as set forth in GCB DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 4.12.1, each  of GCB and each GCB Subsidiary is in compliance in all
material respects with  all applicable federal, state, local and foreign
statutes, laws, regulations,  ordinances, rules, judgments, orders or decrees
applicable to it, its  properties, assets and deposits, its business, and its
conduct of business  and  its relationship with its employees, including,
without limitation, the USA  Patriot Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act,
the Fair Housing Act, the  Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, the Home
Mortgage Disclosure Act, and all  other

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

27  

 

 

 

 


 

applicable  fair lending laws and other laws relating to discriminatory
business practices  and neither GCB nor any GCB Subsidiary has received,
since December 31, 2003,  any written notice to the contrary. The Board of
Directors of GC Bank  has adopted and GC Bank has implemented an anti-money
laundering program that  contains adequate and appropriate customer
identification verification  procedures that has not been deemed ineffective
by any Governmental Authority  and that meets the requirements of Sections
352 and 326 of the USA Patriot  Act  and the regulations thereunder.

 

 

4.12.2. Each  of GCB and each GCB Subsidiary has all material permits,
licenses,  authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all filings,
applications  and registrations with, all Governmental Entities and Bank
Regulators that  are  required in order to permit it to own or lease its
properties and to conduct  its  business as presently conducted; all such
permits, licenses, certificates of  authority, orders and approvals are in
full force and effect and, to the  Knowledge of GCB, no suspension or
cancellation of any such permit, license,  certificate, order or approval is
threatened or will result from the  consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, subject to  obtaining Regulatory Approvals.

 

 

4.12.3. Since  December 31, 2003, neither GCB nor any GCB Subsidiary has
received any written  notification or, to the Knowledge of GCB, any other
communication from any  Bank  Regulator (i) asserting that GCB or any GCB
Subsidiary is not in material  compliance with any of the statutes,
regulations or ordinances which such Bank  Regulator enforces; (ii)
threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit  or  governmental
authorization which is material to GCB or any GCB Subsidiary;  (iii)
requiring, or threatening to require, GCB or any GCB Subsidiary, or 
indicating that GCB or any GCB Subsidiary may be required, to enter into a 
cease  and desist order, agreement or memorandum of understanding or any
other  agreement with any federal or state governmental agency or authority
which  is  charged with the supervision or regulation of banks or engages in
the insurance  of bank deposits restricting or limiting, or purporting to
restrict or limit,  in  any material respect the operations of GCB or any
GCB Subsidiary, including  without limitation any restriction on the payment
of dividends; or (iv)  directing, restricting or limiting, or purporting to
direct, restrict or limit,  in any material fashion the operations of GCB or
any GCB Subsidiary, including  without limitation any restriction on the
payment of dividends (any such notice,  communication, memorandum, agreement
or order described in this sentence is  hereinafter referred to as a "GCB
Regulatory Agreement"). Neither GCB nor GC  Bank nor any other GCB Subsidiary
has consented to or entered into any GCB  Regulatory Agreement that is
currently in effect or that was in effect since  December 31, 2003. The most
recent regulatory rating given to GC Bank  as to compliance with the
Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") is satisfactory or  better.

 

 

4.12.4. Since  the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, GCB has been and is
in compliance  in  all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions
of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate
governance  rules and regulations of the Nasdaq. GCB DISCLOSURE  SCHEDULE
4.12.4 sets forth, as of August 31, 2007, a schedule of all  executive
officers and directors of GCB who have outstanding loans from GCB  or  GC
Bank, and there has been no default on, or forgiveness or waiver of, in 
whole  or in part, any such loan during the two years immediately preceding
the date  hereof.

Employee  Benefit Plans.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

4.13.1. GCB  DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.1 includes a descriptive list of all
existing bonus,  incentive, deferred compensation, pension, retirement,
profit-sharing, thrift,  savings, employee stock ownership, stock bonus,
stock purchase, restricted  stock, stock option, stock appreciation, phantom
stock, severance, welfare  benefit plans (including paid time off policies
and other benefit policies  and  procedures), fringe benefit plans,
employment, severance and change in control  agreements and all other
material benefit practices, policies and arrangements  maintained by GCB or
any GCB Subsidiary in which any employee or former  employee, consultant or
former consultant or director or former director of  GCB  or any GCB
Subsidiary participates or to which any such employee, consultant  or 
director is a party or is otherwise entitled to receive benefits (the "GCB 
Compensation and Benefit Plans"). Except as set forth in GCB  DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 4.13.1, neither GCB nor any of its Subsidiaries has any  commitment
to create any additional GCB Compensation and Benefit Plan or to  materially
modify, change or renew any existing GCB Compensation and Benefit  Plan (any
modification or change that increases the cost of such plans would  be 
deemed material), except as required to maintain the qualified status
thereof,  GCB has made available to OFC true and correct copies of the GCB
Compensation  and Benefit Plans.

 

 

4.13.2. To  the Knowledge of GCB and except as disclosed in GCB DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 4.13.2,  each GCB Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated
and administered in  all  material respects in accordance with its terms and
with applicable law,  including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the
Securities Act, the Exchange  Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,
COBRA, the Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") and
any regulations or rules  promulgated thereunder, and all material filings,
disclosures and notices  required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the Age  Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA and HIPAA and
any other applicable  law  have been timely made or any interest, fines,
penalties or other impositions  for  late filings have been paid in full.
Each GCB Compensation and  Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit
plan" within the meaning of  Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and
which is intended to be qualified  under Section 401(a) of the Code, is
subject of a "Favorable Letter" within  the meaning of Rev. Proc. 2006-27
Section 5.01, and GCB is not aware of any  circumstances which are reasonably
likely to result in revocation of any such  Favorable Letter. There is no
material pending or, to the Knowledge  of GCB, threatened action, suit or
claim relating to any of the GCB Compensation  and Benefit Plans (other than
routine claims for benefits). Neither  GCB nor any GCB Subsidiary has engaged
in a transaction, or omitted to take  any  action, with respect to any GCB
Compensation and Benefit Plan that would  reasonably be expected to subject

assets  of each GCB Defined Benefit Plan exceeds the present value of the
benefits  guaranteed under Section 4022 of ERISA under such GCB Defined
Benefit Plan  as of  the end of the most recent plan year with respect to

Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide,  security to any GCB
Defined Benefit Plan or to any single-employer plan of  an  ERISA Affiliate
pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code or has taken any  action, or
omitted to take any action, that has resulted, or would reasonably  be 
expected to result in the imposition of a lien under Section 412(n) of the 
Code  or pursuant to ERISA. Neither GCB, its Subsidiaries, nor any ERISA
Affiliate  has  contributed to any "multiemployer plan," as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA,  on or after January 1, 1998. To the Knowledge of
GCB, and except as  set forth in GCB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.3, there is no

on GCB's consolidated  financial statements to the extent required by GAAP.

Benefit Plan for  financial reporting purposes as required by GAAP.

other applicable  law. Except as set forth in GCB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE

Subsidiary that  would reasonably be expected to promise or guarantee such
employees retiree  health, life insurance, disability insurance, or other
retiree death  benefits.

 

 

4.13.6. Except  as set forth in GCB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.13.6, GCB and its
Subsidiaries do  not maintain any GCB Compensation and Benefit Plans covering
employees who  are  not United States residents.

applicable, GCB has  provided or made available to OFC copies of: (A) any
trust  instruments and insurance contracts; (B) the three most recent Forms
5500 filed  with the IRS; (C) the three most recent

benefits under any GCB Compensation and Benefit Plan or  (C)  result in any
material increase in benefits payable under any GCB Compensation  and Benefit
Plan.

the limitations under Section  162(m) of the Code and the regulations issued
thereunder.

 

 

4.13.10. To  the Knowledge of GCB, the consummation of the Mergers and the
Bank Merger will  not, directly or indirectly (including without limitation,

director or independent  contractor of GCB or any GCB Subsidiary to any

Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance  with its terms (except as

reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and  similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights  or by general
equity principles), and is in full force and effect in all  material
respects. Neither GCB nor any

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

35

applicable laws and  regulations. Neither GC Bank nor any other GCB
Subsidiary has, and to  the Knowledge of GCB, nor has any of their respective
directors, officers or  employees, committed any breach of trust with respect
to any such fiduciary  account and the records for each such fiduciary
account.

in all  material respects with all applicable laws respecting employment and
employment  practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and

5.6. _Financial  Statements._

 

 

5.6.1. OFC  has previously made available to GCB the OFC Regulatory Reports.
The  OFC Regulatory Reports have been prepared in all material respects in
accordance  with applicable regulatory accounting principles and practices
throughout the  periods covered by such statements.

 

 

5.6.2. OFC  has previously made available to GCB the OFC Financial 
Statements. The OFC Financial Statements have been prepared in  accordance
with GAAP, and (including the related notes where applicable) fairly  present
in each case in all material respects (subject in the case of the  unaudited
interim statements to normal year-end adjustments) the consolidated 
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of OFC and the OFC 
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of and for the respective periods
ending  on the dates thereof, in accordance with GAAP during the periods
involved,  except as indicated in the notes thereto, or in the case of
unaudited  statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q.

 

 

5.6.3. At  the date of each balance sheet included in the OFC Financial
Statements, OFC  did  not have any liabilities, obligations or loss
contingencies of any nature  (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) of a type required to  be  reflected in such OFC Financial
Statements or in the footnotes thereto which  are  not fully reflected or
reserved against therein or fully disclosed in a footnote  thereto, except
for liabilities, obligations and loss contingencies which are  not material
individually or in the aggregate or which are incurred in the  ordinary
course of business, consistent with past practice, and except for 
liabilities, obligations and loss contingencies which are within the subject 
matter of a specific representation and warranty herein and subject, in the 
case  of any unaudited statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments and
the  absence of footnotes.

 

 

5.6.4. The  records, systems, controls, data and information of OFC and its
Subsidiaries  are  recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic,  mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under  the exclusive ownership and direct
control of OFC or its Subsidiaries or  accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for  any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control that would not reasonably  be  expected to have a
material adverse effect on the system of

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 


 

internal  accounting controls described below in this Section 5.6.4. OFC 
(x) has implemented and maintains a system of internal control over 
financial reporting (as required by Rule 13a-15(a) of the Exchange Act) that 
is  designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial  reporting and the preparation of its financial statements for
external purposes  in accordance with GAAP, (y) has implemented and maintains
disclosure  controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the
Exchange Act)  to  ensure that material information relating to OFC,
including its consolidated  Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief  financial officer of OFC by others within
those entities, and (z) has  disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
prior to the date hereof, to  OFC's outside auditors and the audit committee
of OFC's Board of Directors  (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or  operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule  13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect  OFC's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and  (ii) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other  employees who have a
significant role in OFC's internal control over financial  reporting. As of
the date hereof, to the knowledge of OFC, its chief executive  officer and
chief financial officer will be able to give the certifications  required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to  Section 302 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next  due.

 

 

5.6.5. Since  December 31, 2004, (i) neither OFC nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the  Knowledge of OFC, any director, officer, employee, auditor,
accountant, or  representative of OFC or any of its Subsidiaries has received
or otherwise  had  or obtained knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion, or  claim, whether written or oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices,  procedures, methodologies, or methods of
OFC or any of its Subsidiaries or  their  respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint,  allegation, assertion, or claim
that OFC or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged  in questionable accounting
or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney  representing OFC or any of its
Subsidiaries has reported evidence of a material  violation of Securities
Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation  by  OFC or any of its
officers, directors, employees, or agents to the Board of  Directors of OFC
or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of  OFC.

 

 

5.6.6. The  allowance for credit losses reflected in OFC's audited statement
of condition at  June 30, 2007 was, and the allowance for credit losses shown
on the balance  sheets in OFC's Securities Documents for periods ending after
June 30, 2007 was  or will be, as the case may be, adequate, as of the dates
thereof, under  GAAP.

 

 

5.7. _Taxes._

 

 

OFC  and  the OFC Subsidiaries that are at least 80 percent owned by OFC are
members  of  the same affiliated group within the meaning of Code Section 
1504(a). OFC has duly filed all federal, state and material local tax 
returns required to be filed by or with respect to OFC and each OFC
Subsidiary  on or prior to the Closing Date, taking into account any
extensions (all such  returns, to the Knowledge of OFC, being accurate and
correct in all material  respects) and has duly paid or made provisions for
the payment of all material  federal, state and local taxes which have been
incurred by or are due or claimed  to be due from OFC and any OFC Subsidiary
by any taxing authority or pursuant  to  any written tax sharing agreement
on or prior to the Closing Date other than  taxes or other charges which (i)
are not delinquent, (ii) are being

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 


 

contested  in good faith, or (iii) have not yet been fully determined. OFC 
and each of its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all taxes required to
have  been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee,  independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third
party, and OFC  and  each of its Subsidiaries, to the Knowledge of OFC, has
timely complied with  all  applicable information reporting requirements
under Part III, Subchapter A  of  Chapter 61 of the Code and similar
applicable state and local information  reporting requirements.

 

 

5.8. _No  Material Adverse Effect._

 

 

OFC  has  not suffered any Material Adverse Effect since June 30, 2007 and
no event has  occurred or circumstance arisen since that date which, in the
aggregate, has  had  or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on OFC.

 

 

5.9. _Ownership  of Property; Insurance Coverage._

 

 

5.9.1. OFC  and each OFC Subsidiary has good and, as to real property,
marketable title  to  all material assets and properties owned by OFC or
each OFC Subsidiary in the  conduct of their businesses, whether such assets
and properties are real or  personal, tangible or intangible, including
assets and property reflected in  the  balance sheets contained in the OFC
Financial Statements or acquired subsequent  thereto (except to the extent
that such assets and properties have been disposed  of in the ordinary course
of business, since the date of such balance sheets),  subject to no material
encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests or  pledges, except (i)
those items which secure liabilities for public or statutory  obligations or
any discount with, borrowing from or other obligations to FHLB,  inter-bank
credit facilities, or any transaction by a OFC Subsidiary acting  in a 
fiduciary capacity, (ii) statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or 
which  are being contested in good faith, (iii) non-monetary liens affecting
real  property which do not adversely affect the value or use of such real
property,  and (iv) those described and reflected in the OFC Financial 
Statements. OFC and the OFC Subsidiaries, as lessee, have the right  under
valid and existing leases of real and personal properties used by OFC  and 
its Subsidiaries in the conduct of their businesses to occupy or use all
such  properties as presently occupied and used by each of them.

 

 

5.9.2. OFC  and each OFC Subsidiary currently maintain insurance considered
by each of  them  to be reasonable for their respective operations. Neither
OFC nor any  OFC Subsidiary has received notice from any insurance carrier
during the past  two years that (i) such insurance will be canceled or that
coverage thereunder  will be materially reduced or eliminated, or (ii)
premium costs (other than  with  respect to health or disability insurance)
with respect to such policies of  insurance will be substantially increased.
There are presently no material  claims pending under such policies of
insurance and no notices have been given  by OFC or any OFC Subsidiary under
such policies (other than with respect to  health, disability, or worker's
compensation insurance). All such insurance is  valid and enforceable and in
full force and effect in all material respects,  and  within the last two
years OFC and each OFC Subsidiary has received each type  of  insurance
coverage for which it has applied and during such periods has not  been 
denied indemnification for any material claims submitted under any of its 
insurance policies. OFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 5.9.3 identifies all material 
policies of insurance maintained by OFC and each OFC Subsidiary.

_Legal  Proceedings._

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

Except  as  disclosed in OFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 5.10, neither OFC nor any
OFC  Subsidiary is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge  of  OFC, threatened legal, administrative, arbitration or other
proceedings, claims  (whether asserted or unasserted), actions or
governmental investigations or  inquiries of any nature (i) against OFC or
any OFC Subsidiary, (ii) to  which OFC or any OFC Subsidiary's assets are or
may be subject,  (iii) challenging the validity or propriety of any of the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) which would reasonably
be expected  to  adversely affect the ability of OFC to perform under this
Agreement, except  for  any proceeding, claim, action, investigation or
inquiry which, if adversely  determined, individually or in the aggregate,
would not be reasonably expected  to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

5.11. _Compliance  With Applicable Law._

 

 

5.11.1. To  the Knowledge of OFC, each of OFC and each OFC Subsidiary is in
compliance  in  all material respects with all applicable federal, state,
local and foreign  statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments,
orders or decrees  applicable to it, its properties, assets and deposits, its
business, and its  conduct of business and its relationship with its
employees, including, without  limitation, the USA Patriot Act, the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair  Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act
of 1977, the Home Mortgage  Disclosure Act, and all other applicable fair
lending laws and other laws  relating to discriminatory business practices,
and neither OFC nor any OFC  Subsidiary has received, since December 31,
2003, any written notice to the  contrary. The Board of Directors of Oritani
Savings Bank has adopted and Oritani  Savings Bank has implemented an anti-
money laundering program that contains  adequate and appropriate customer
identification verification procedures that  has not been deemed ineffective
by any Governmental Authority and that meets  the  requirements of Sections
352 and 326 of the USA Patriot Act and the regulations  thereunder.

 

 

5.11.2. Each  of OFC and each OFC Subsidiary has all material permits,
licenses,  authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all filings,
applications  and registrations with, all Governmental Entities and Bank
Regulators that  are  required in order to permit it to own or lease its
properties and to conduct  its  business as presently conducted; all such
permits, licenses, certificates of  authority, orders and approvals are in
full force and effect and, to the  Knowledge of OFC, no suspension or
cancellation of any such permit, license,  certificate, order or approval is
threatened or will result from the  consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, subject to  obtaining the Regulatory
Approvals.

 

 

5.11.3. For  the period beginning January 1, 2003, neither OFC nor any OFC
Subsidiary  has received any written notification or, to the Knowledge of
OFC, any other  communication from any Bank Regulator (i) asserting that OFC
or any OFC  Subsidiary is not in material compliance with any of the
statutes, regulations  or ordinances which such Bank Regulator enforces; (ii)
threatening to revoke  any  license, franchise, permit or governmental
authorization which is material  to  OFC or Oritani Savings Bank; (iii)
requiring or threatening to require OFC  or  any OFC Subsidiary, or
indicating that OFC or any OFC Subsidiary may be  required, to enter into a
cease and desist order, agreement or memorandum of  understanding or any
other agreement with any federal or state governmental  agency or authority
which is charged

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 


 

with  the  supervision or regulation of banks or engages in the insurance of
bank deposits  restricting or limiting, or purporting to restrict or limit,
in any material  respect the operations of OFC or any OFC Subsidiary,
including without  limitation any restriction on the payment of dividends; or
(iv) directing,  restricting or limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict
or limit, in any  manner the operations of OFC or any OFC Subsidiary,
including without limitation  any restriction on the payment of dividends
(any such notice, communication,  memorandum, agreement or order described in
this sentence is hereinafter  referred to as an "OFC Regulatory Agreement").
Neither OFC nor any OFC  Subsidiary has consented to or entered into any
currently effective OFC  Regulatory Agreement. The most recent regulatory
rating given to  Oritani Savings Bank as to compliance with the CRA is
satisfactory or  better.

 

 

5.11.4. Since  the date of completion of its initial public offering, OFC has
been and is  in  compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable
provisions of  the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and
corporate  governance rules and regulations of the Nasdaq.

 

 

5.12. _Employee  Benefit Plans._

 

 

5.12.1.   OFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 5.12.1 includes a list of all existing
bonus, incentive,  deferred compensation, pension, retirement, profit-
sharing, thrift, savings,  employee stock ownership, stock bonus, stock
purchase, restricted stock, stock  option, stock appreciation, phantom stock,
severance, welfare benefit plans,  fringe benefit plans, employment,
severance and change in control agreements  and  all other benefit
practices, policies and arrangements maintained by OFC or  any  OFC
Subsidiary and in which employees in general may participate (the "OFC 
Compensation and Benefit Plans"). OFC has made available to GCB  true and
correct copies of the OFC Compensation and Benefit Plans.

 

 

5.12.2. To  the Knowledge of OFC and except as disclosed in OFC DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 5.12.2,  each OFC Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated
and administered in  all  material respects in accordance with its terms and
with applicable law,  including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the
Securities Act, the Exchange  Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,
COBRA, HIPAA, and any regulations  or rules promulgated thereunder, and no
notice has been issued by any  Governmental Entity questioning or challenging
such compliance. All  material filings, disclosures and notices required by
ERISA, the Code, the  Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act  and  any other applicable law have been
timely made or any interest, fines, penalties  or other impositions for late
filings have been paid in full. Each  OFC Compensation and Benefit Plan which
is a Pension Plan _and_ which is  intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a  favorable determination letter from the
IRS, and OFC is not aware of any  circumstances which are reasonably likely
to result in revocation of any such  favorable determination letter. There is
no material pending or, to  the Knowledge of OFC, threatened action, suit or
claim relating to any of the  OFC Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than
routine claims for  benefits). Neither OFC nor any OFC Subsidiary has engaged
in a  transaction, or omitted to take any action, with respect to any OFC
Compensation  and Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject
OFC or any OFC  Subsidiary to an unpaid tax or penalty imposed by either
Section 4975 of the  Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 


 

5.12.3. No  liability to any Governmental Entity, other than PBGC premiums
arising in the  ordinary course of business, has been or is expected by OFC
or any of its  Subsidiaries to be incurred with respect to any OFC
Compensation and Benefit  Plan which is a Defined Benefit Plan or with
respect to any ERISA Affiliate  Plan  currently or formerly maintained by
OFC or any ERISA Affiliate. No  OFC Defined Benefit Plan had an "accumulated
funding deficiency" (as defined  in  Section 302 of ERISA), whether or not
waived, as of the last day of the end  of  the most recent plan year ending
prior to the date hereof. No notice  of a "reportable event" (as defined in
Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the  30-day reporting requirement has not
been waived has been required to be filed  for any OFC Defined Benefit Plan
within the 12-month period ending on the date  hereof. Neither OFC nor any of
its Subsidiaries has provided, or is  required to provide, security to any
OFC Defined Benefit Plan or to any  single-employer plan of an ERISA
Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of  the  Code or has taken any
action, or omitted to take any action, that has resulted,  or would
reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of a lien under  Section
412(n) of the Code or pursuant to ERISA. Neither OFC, its  Subsidiaries, nor
any ERISA Affiliate has contributed to any "multiemployer  plan," as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA, on or after January 1,  1998. To the Knowledge of
OFC, there is no pending investigation or  enforcement action by any Bank
Regulator with respect to any OFC Compensation  and Benefit Plan or any ERISA
Affiliate Plan.

 

 

5.12.4. All  material contributions required to be made under the terms of
any OFC  Compensation and Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan or any
employee benefit  arrangements to which OFC or any OFC Subsidiary is a party
or a sponsor have  been timely made, and all anticipated contributions and
funding obligations  are  accrued on OFC's consolidated financial statements
to the extent required by  GAAP. OFC and its Subsidiaries have expensed and
accrued as a  liability the present value of future benefits under each
applicable OFC  Compensation and Benefit Plan for financial reporting
purposes as required  by  GAAP.

 

 

5.12.5. The  consummation of the Merger will not, directly or indirectly
(including, without  limitation, as a result of any termination of employment
or service at any  time  prior to or following the Effective Time) (A)
entitle any employee, consultant,  or director to any payment or benefit
(including severance pay, change in  control benefit, or similar
compensation) or any increase in compensation,  (B)  result in the vesting
or acceleration of any benefits under any OFC Compensation  and Benefit Plan
or (C) result in any material increase in benefits payable  under any OFC
Compensation and Benefit Plan.

 

 

5.12.6. The  consummation of the Merger will not, directly or indirectly
(including without  limitation, as a result of any termination of employment
or service at any  time  prior to or following the Effective Time), entitle
any current or former  employee, director, or independent contractor of OFC
or any OFC Subsidiary  to  any actual or deemed payment (or benefit) which
could constitute a "parachute  payment" (as such term is defined in Section
280G of the Code),

 

 

5.13. _Environmental  Matters._

 

 

5.13.1. To  the Knowledge of OFC, neither the conduct nor operation of its
business nor  any  condition of any property currently or previously owned
or operated by it  (including, without limitation, in a fiduciary or agency
capacity), or on which  it holds a lien, results or resulted in a violation
of any Environmental Laws  that is reasonably likely to impose a

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 


 

material  liability (including a material remediation obligation) upon OFC or
any of  OFC  Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of OFC, no condition has existed
or  event has occurred with respect to any of them or any such property that,
with  notice or the passage of time, or both, is reasonably likely to result
in any  material liability to OFC or any OFC Subsidiary by reason of any
Environmental  Laws. Neither OFC nor any OFC Subsidiary during the past five
years  has received any written notice from any Person that OFC or any OFC
Subsidiary  or the operation or condition of any property ever owned,
operated, or held  as  collateral or in a fiduciary capacity by any of them
are currently in violation  of or otherwise are alleged to have financial
exposure under any Environmental  Laws or relating to Materials of
Environmental Concern (including, but not  limited to, responsibility (or
potential responsibility) for the cleanup or  other remediation of any
Materials of Environmental Concern at, on, beneath,  or  originating from
any such property) for which a material liability is reasonably  likely to be
imposed upon OFC or any OFC Subsidiary.

 

 

5.13.2. There  is no suit, claim, action, demand, executive or administrative
order, directive,  investigation or proceeding pending or, to the OFC 's
Knowledge, threatened,  before any court, governmental agency or other forum
against OFC or any OFC  Subsidiary (x) for alleged noncompliance (including
by any predecessor) with,  or  liability under, any Environmental Law or (y)
relating to the presence of or  release (defined herein) into the environment
of any Materials of Environmental  Concern (as defined herein), whether or
not occurring at or on a site owned,  leased or operated by any of the OFC .

 

 

5.14. _Loan  Portfolio._

 

 

5.14.1.   The allowance for loan losses reflected in OFC's audited
consolidated  balance sheet at June 30, 2007 was, and the allowance for loan
losses shown  on  the balance sheets in OFC's Securities Documents for
periods ending after June  30, 2007 were adequate, as of the dates thereof,
under GAAP.

one or more of its  representatives to confer with representatives of OFC and
report the general  status of its ongoing operations at such times as OFC may
reasonably  request. GCB will promptly notify OFC of any material change in
the  normal course of its business or in the operation of its properties and,
to  the  extent permitted by applicable law, of any governmental
complaints,  investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that
the same may  be  contemplated), or the institution or the threat of
material litigation involving  GCB or any GCB Subsidiary. Without limiting
the foregoing, senior  officers of OFC and GCB shall meet on a reasonably
regular basis (expected  to be  at least monthly) to review the financial
and operational affairs of GCB and  its  Subsidiaries, in accordance with
applicable law, and GCB shall give due  consideration to OFC's input on such
matters, with the understanding that,  notwithstanding any other provision

under any circumstance be permitted to exercise control  of GCB or any GCB
Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

6.2.2. GCB  and OFC shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and plan for the
conversion  of  GC Bank's data processing and related electronic

by GC Bank of third-party service  provider arrangements effective at the
Effective Time or at a date thereafter,  non-renewal of personal property
leases and software licenses used by GC Bank  in  connection with its

employees to assist with the conversion, and outsourcing, as  appropriate, of
proprietary or self-provided system services, it being  understood that GC
Bank shall not be obligated to take any such action prior  to  the Effective
Time and, unless GC Bank otherwise agrees, no conversion shall  take place
prior to the Effective Time. In the event that GC Bank  takes, at the request
of Oritani Savings Bank, any action relative to third  parties to facilitate
the conversion that results in the imposition of any  termination fees or
charges, Oritani Savings Bank shall indemnify GC Bank for  any such fees and
charges, and the costs of reversing the conversion process,  if  for any
reason the Merger is not consummated for any reason other than a breach  of
this Agreement by GCB, or a termination of this Agreement under Section 
11.1.8 or 11.1.9.

6.2.3. GC  Bank shall provide Oritani Savings Bank, within fifteen (15)

and purchases of securities by GCB Bank, which  schedule shall indicate the
loan amount, loan type and other material features  of the loan and the
purchase price, maturity, principal amount and other  material features of
the securities purchased.

 

 

6.2.4. GCB  shall promptly inform OFC upon receiving notice of any legal,

board) relating to the alleged  liability of GCB or any GCB Subsidiary under
any labor or employment  law.

 

 

6.2.5. Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Article
VI, GCB shall not be required  to take any action that would provide access
to or disclose information where  such access or disclosure, in GCB's
reasonable judgment would violate or  prejudice the rights or business
interests or confidences of any customer or  other person, would violate any
law or any agreement to which GCB or any GCB  Subsidiary is bound, or would
result in the waiver by it of the privilege  protecting communications
between it and any of its counsel.

 

 

6.3. _Access  to Properties and Records._

 

 

Subject  to Section 12.1 hereof, prior to the earlier of the termination of

all of its  books, papers and records relating to the assets, properties,
operations,  obligations and liabilities, including, but not limited to, all
books of account  (including the general ledger), tax records, minute books
of directors' (other  than minutes that discuss any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement  or any other subject matter GCB reasonably
determines should be treated as  confidential) and shareholders' meetings,
organizational documents, Bylaws,  material contracts and agreements, filings
with any regulatory authority,  litigation files, plans affecting employees,
and any other business activities  or prospects in which OFC may have a
reasonable interest; provided, however,  that GCB shall not be required to
take any action that would provide access  to  or to disclose information
where such access or disclosure would violate or  prejudice the rights or
business interests or confidences of any customer or  other person, would
violate any law or any agreement to which GCB or any GCB  Subsidiary is
bound, or would result in the waiver by it of the privilege  protecting
communications between it and any of its counsel. GCB shall provide  and
shall request its auditors to provide OFC with such historical financial 
information regarding it (and related audit reports and consents) as OFC may 
reasonably request for securities disclosure purposes. OFC shall use 
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with GCB's
regular  business operations during any such access to GCB's property, books
and  records. GCB and each GCB Subsidiary shall permit OFC, at its  expense,
to cause a "phase I

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 


 

environmental  audit" and a "phase II environmental audit" to be performed at
any physical  location owned or occupied by GCB or any GCB Subsidiary. In the

legally  prohibited thereby. Within 25 days after the end of each month,

statement  of  income, without related notes, for such month prepared in
accordance with  current financial reporting practices.

of any Bank  Regulator with respect to the condition or activities of GCB or
any of the  GCB  Subsidiaries.

financial data  that GCB possesses and as OFC may reasonably request,
including without  limitation, detailed monthly financial statements and loan
reports.

in such amounts  as are reasonable to cover such risks as are customary in
relation to the  character and location of theirs properties and the nature
of their  business

materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or  amendment to such GCB

_6.7._ Consents  and Approvals of Third Parties.

 

 

GCB  shall  use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as soon as
practicable all  consents and approvals necessary or desirable for the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

6.8. _All  Reasonable Efforts._

 

 

Subject  to the terms and conditions herein provided, GCB agrees to use all
commercially  reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action
and to do, or  cause  to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable laws  and  regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement.

 

 

6.9. _Failure  to Fulfill Conditions._

 

 

In  the  event that GCB determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete the  Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that
condition, it will  promptly notify OFC.

 

 

6.10. _No  Solicitation._

 

 

(a)  GCB  shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the respective
officers,  directors, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys,  accountants, consultants, affiliates and other agents
(collectively, the "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit,  induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action to
facilitate the making  of,  any inquiry, offer or proposal which
constitutes, or could reasonably be  expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) participate in any  discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal or furnish,  or  otherwise afford access, to any Person
(other than OFC) any information or  data  with respect to GCB or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an  Acquisition Proposal; (iii) release
any Person from, waive any provisions  of, or fail to enforce any
confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement  to  which GCB is a party;
or (iv) enter into any agreement, agreement in  principle or letter of intent
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or  approve or resolve to approve
any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement,  agreement in principle or letter
of intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal.  Any violation of the
foregoing restrictions by GCB or any Representative,  whether or not such
Representative is so authorized and whether or not such  Representative is
purporting to act on behalf of GCB or otherwise, shall be  deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement by GCB. GCB and its Subsidiaries shall,  and shall
cause each of GCB Representative to, immediately cease and cause  to be 
terminated any and all existing discussions, negotiations, and
communications  with any Persons with respect to any existing or potential
Acquisition  Proposal.

 



 

For  purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any
inquiry, offer  or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from
OFC), whether or  not  in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that could
reasonably be expected  to  lead to, an Acquisition Transaction. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (A) any
transaction or series of  transactions involving any merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, share  exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving GCB or  any  of its Subsidiaries; (B) any transaction
pursuant to which any third party  or group acquires or would


 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 


 

acquire  (whether through sale, lease or other disposition), directly or
indirectly,  any  assets of GCB or any of its Subsidiaries representing, in
the aggregate, fifteen  percent (15%) or more of the assets of GCB and its
Subsidiaries on a  consolidated basis; (C) any issuance, sale or other
disposition of  (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or
any similar  transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase or  securities convertible into, such securities) representing
fifteen percent  (15%) or more of the votes attached to the outstanding
securities of GCB or  any of its Subsidiaries; (D) any tender offer or
exchange offer that, if  consummated, would result in any third party or
group beneficially owning  fifteen percent (15%) or more of any class of
equity securities of GCB or  any of its Subsidiaries; or (E) any transaction
which is similar in form,  substance or purpose to any of the foregoing
transactions, or any combination  of  the foregoing.

 



 

(b)  Notwithstanding Section 6.10(a), GCB may take any of the actions
described  in clause (ii) of Section 6.10(a) if, but only if, (i) GCB has 
received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not 
result from a breach of this Section 6.10; (ii) GCB Board determines  in good
faith, after consultation with and having considered the advice of  its 
outside legal counsel and its independent financial advisor, that (A) such 
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior  Proposal and (B) the failure to take such actions would be
inconsistent  with its fiduciary duties to GCB's shareholders under
applicable law;  (iii) GCB has provided OFC with at least three (3) Business
Days' prior notice of such determination; and (iv) prior to furnishing or 
affording access to any information or data with respect to GCB or any of
its  Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, GCB
receives  from  such Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less
favorable to GCB  than  those contained in the August 31, 2007
Confidentiality Agreement. GCB shall  promptly provide to OFC any non-public
information regarding GCB or its  Subsidiaries provided to any other Person
that was not previously provided  to  OFC, such additional information to be
provided no later than the date of  provision of such information to such
other party.

 



 

For  purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
written  proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended
or  modified) made by a third party to enter into an Acquisition Transaction
on  terms that GCB Board determines in its good faith judgment, after
consultation  with and having considered the advice of outside legal counsel
and a financial  advisor (i) would, if consummated, result in the acquisition
of all, but  not less than all, of the issued and outstanding shares of GCB
Common Stock  or  all, or substantially all, of the assets of GCB and its
Subsidiaries on a  consolidated basis; (ii) would result in a transaction
that  (A) involves consideration to the holders of the shares of GCB Common
Stock  that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, than the
consideration  to be paid to GCB's shareholders pursuant to this Agreement,
considering, among  other things, the nature of the consideration being
offered and any material  regulatory approvals or other risks associated with
the timing of the proposed  transaction beyond or in addition to those
specifically contemplated hereby,  and  which proposal is not conditioned
upon obtaining additional financing and  (B) is, in light of the other terms
of such proposal, more favorable to  GCB's shareholders than the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement; and (iii) is reasonably
likely to be completed on the terms  proposed, in each case taking into
account all legal, financial, regulatory  and  other aspects of the
proposal.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 


 

(c)  GCB  shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify OFC  in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any
information is  requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought
to be initiated  or  continued with, GCB or any GCB Representatives, in each
case in connection  with  any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall
indicate the name of the Person  initiating such discussions or negotiations
or making such proposal, offer  or  information request and the material
terms and conditions of any proposals  or  offers (and, in the case of
written materials relating to such proposal, offer,  information request,
negotiations or discussion, providing copies of such  materials (including
e-mails or other electronic communications) unless  (i) such materials
constitute confidential information of the party making  such offer or
proposal under an effective confidentiality agreement,  (ii) disclosure of
such materials jeopardizes the attorney-client privilege  or (iii) disclosure
of such materials contravenes any law, rule,  regulation, order, judgment or
decree. GCB agrees that it shall keep OFC  informed, on a current basis, of
the status and terms of any such proposal,  offer, information request,
negotiations or discussions (including any  amendments or modifications to
such proposal, offer or request).

 



 

(d)  Neither the GCB Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw,
qualify  or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to  OFC  in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including  the Merger), the GCB Recommendation (as defined in
Section 8.1), or make any  statement, filing or release, in connection with
GCB Shareholders Meeting or  otherwise, inconsistent with the GCB
Recommendation (it being understood that  taking a neutral position or no
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal  shall be considered an
adverse modification of the GCB Recommendation);  (ii) approve or recommend,
or propose to approve or recommend, any  Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter
into (or cause GCB or any of its  Subsidiaries to enter into) any letter of
intent, agreement in principle,  acquisition agreement or other agreement (A)
related to any Acquisition  Transaction (other than a confidentiality
agreement entered into in accordance  with the provisions of Section 6.10(b))
or (B) requiring GCB to  abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger
or any other transaction  contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(e)  Notwithstanding Section 6.10(d), prior to the date of GCB Shareholders 
Meeting, the GCB Board may approve or recommend to the shareholders of GCB 
a  Superior Proposal and withdraw, qualify or modify GCB Recommendation in 
connection therewith (a "GCB Subsequent Determination") after the fifth (5th)
Business  Day  following OFC's receipt of a notice (the "Notice of Superior
Proposal") from GCB  advising OFC that the GCB Board has decided that a bona
fide unsolicited written  Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not
result from a breach of  this  Section 6.10) constitutes a Superior Proposal
(it being understood that GCB  shall be required to deliver a new Notice of
Superior Proposal in respect of  any  revised Superior Proposal from such
third party or its affiliates that GCB  proposes to accept) if, but only if,
(i) the GCB Board has reasonably  determined in good faith, after
consultation with and having considered the  advice of outside legal counsel
and a financial advisor, that it is required  to  take such actions to
comply with its fiduciary duties to GCB's shareholders  under applicable law,
(ii) during the five (5) Business Day Period  after receipt of the Notice of
Superior Proposal by OFC, GCB and the GCB Board  shall have cooperated and
negotiated in good faith with OFC to make such  adjustments, modifications or
amendments to the terms and conditions of this  Agreement as would enable GCB
to proceed with the GCB Recommendation without  a  GCB


 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 


 

Subsequent  Determination; _provided_ , _however_ , that OFC shall not have
any  obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to
the terms  and conditions of this Agreement and (iii) at the end of such
five  (5) Business Day period, after taking into account any such adjusted, 
modified or amended terms as may have been proposed by OFC since its receipt 
of  such Notice of Superior Proposal, GCB Board has again in good faith made
the  determination (A) in clause (i) of this Section 6.10(e) and  (B) that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the changing, qualifying or modifying of the  GCB 
Recommendation or the making of a GCB Subsequent Determination by the GCB
Board  shall not change the approval of the GCB Board for purposes of causing
any  Takeover Laws to be inapplicable to this Agreement and the GCB Voting
Agreements  and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including
the  Merger.

 



 

(f)  Nothing contained in this Section 6.10 shall prohibit GCB or the GCB
Board  from complying with GCB's obligations required under Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a)  promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any  such disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a
change  in  GCB Recommendation unless GCB Board reaffirms GCB Recommendation
in such  disclosure.

 



 

6.11. _Reserves  and Merger-Related Costs._

 

 

During  the period from the date of this Agreement through the earlier of
the  termination of this Agreement or the Closing Date, GCB agrees to consult
with  OFC with respect to its loan, litigation and real estate valuation
policies  and  practices (including loan classifications and levels of 
reserves). OFC and GCB shall also consult with respect to the  character,
amount and timing of restructuring charges to be taken by each of  them in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and shall take  such 
charges as OFC shall reasonably request and which are not inconsistent with 
GAAP, provided that no such actions need be effected until OFC shall have 
irrevocably certified to GCB that all conditions set forth in Article IX to 
the  obligation of OFC to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
(other  than  the delivery of certificates or opinions) have been satisfied
or, where legally  permissible, waived.

 

 

6.12.   _Board of Directors and Committee Meetings._

 

 

GCB  and  GC Bank shall permit representatives of OFC (no more than two) to
attend any  meeting of the Board of Directors of GCB and/or GC Bank or the
Executive and  Loan Committees thereof as an observer, provided that neither
GCB nor GC Bank  shall be required to permit the OFC representative to remain
present during  any  confidential discussion of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated  hereby or any third party proposal to acquire
control of GCB or GC Bank or  during any other matter that the respective
Board of Directors has reasonably  determined to be confidential with respect
to OFC's participation or the  disclosure of which would violate any attorney
client privilege.

 

 

6.13. _GCB  DRIP_

 

 

Promptly  following execution of this Agreement, GCB shall take such steps as
necessary  to  suspend the GCB DRIP until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement  or  the Closing Date, and if the Closing Date occurs, to
terminate the GCB  DRIP.

**ARTICLE  VII**

 

**COVENANTS  OF OFC**

 

 

7.1. _Conduct  of Business._

 

 

During  the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date,
except with  the  written consent of GCB, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, OFC  will, and it will cause each OFC Subsidiary to
use reasonable efforts to  preserve intact its business organization and
assets and maintain its rights  and  franchises; and voluntarily take no
action that would: (i) adversely affect  the  ability of the parties to
obtain the Regulatory Approvals or other approvals  of  Governmental
Entities required for the transaction contemplated hereby, or  materially
increase the period of time necessary to obtain such approvals;  (ii) 
adversely affect its ability to perform its covenants and agreements under 
this  Agreement; or (iii) result in the representations and warranties
contained  in  Article V of this Agreement not being true and correct on the
date of this  Agreement or at any future date on or prior to the Closing Date
or in any of  the  conditions set forth in Article IX hereof not being
satisfied.

 

 

7.2. _Current  Information._

 

 

During  the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, OFC
will cause  one or more of its representatives to confer with representatives
of GCB and  report the general status of its financial condition, operations
and business  and matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby,  at such times as GCB may reasonably request. OFC will
promptly notify GCB,  to  the extent permitted by applicable law, of any
governmental complaints,  investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may  be  contemplated), or the institution of
material litigation involving OFC and  any  OFC Subsidiary. OFC shall be
reasonably responsive to requests by GCB  for access to such information and
personnel regarding OFC and its Subsidiaries  as may be reasonably necessary
for GCB to confirm that the representations  and  warranties of OFC
contained herein are true and correct and that the covenants  of OFC
contained herein have been performed in all material respects; provided, 
however, that OFC shall not be required to take any action that would
provide  access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure, in OFC's  reasonable judgment, would interfere with the normal
conduct of OFC's business  or would violate or prejudice the rights or
business interests or confidences  of  any customer or other person or would
result in the waiver by it of the  privilege protecting communications
between it and any of its  counsel.

 

 

7.3. _Financial  and Other Statements._

 

 

OFC  will  furnish to GCB copies of all documents, statements and reports as
it or any  OFC  Subsidiary files with the OTS or any other Bank Regulator
authority with respect  to the Merger. OFC will furnish to GCB copies of all
documents,  statements and reports as it or any OFC Subsidiary sends to the
shareholders  of  OFC. OFC will advise GCB promptly of the receipt of any
examination  report of any Bank Regulator with respect to the condition or
activities of  OFC  or any OFC subsidiary.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 


 

7.4. _Disclosure  Supplements._

 

 

During  the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, OFC
will  promptly supplement or amend the OFC DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE delivered in
connection  herewith with respect to any material matter hereafter arising
which, if  existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would
have been  required to be set forth or described in such OFC DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE or which  is necessary to correct any information in such OFC
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE which  has been rendered inaccurate thereby. No
supplement or amendment to such OFC  DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE shall have any
effect for the purpose of determining  satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Article IX.

 

 

7.5. _Consents  and Approvals of Third Parties._

 

 

OFC  shall  use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as soon as
practicable all  consents and approvals, necessary or desirable for the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
not take any action or  omit to take any action the effect of which would be
to adversely affect its  ability to obtain Regulatory Approvals or materially
increase the period of  time  necessary to obtain such approvals.

 

 

7.6. _All  Reasonable Efforts._

 

 

Subject  to the terms and conditions herein provided, OFC agrees to use all
commercially  reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action
and to do, or  cause  to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable laws  and  regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement.

 

 

7.7. _Failure  to Fulfill Conditions._

 

 

In  the  event that OFC determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete the  Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that
condition, it will  promptly notify GCB.

 

 

7.8. _Employee  Benefits._

 

 

7.8.1. OFC  will review all GCB Compensation and Benefit Plans to determine
whether to  maintain, terminate or continue such plans. In the event
employee  compensation and/or benefits as currently provided by GCB or any
GCB Subsidiary  are changed or terminated by OFC, in whole or in part, OFC
shall provide  Continuing Employees (as defined below) with compensation and
benefits that  are,  in the aggregate, substantially similar to the
compensation and benefits  provided to similarly situated employees of OFC or
applicable OFC Subsidiary  (as  of the date any such compensation or benefit
is provided). Employees of GCB  or  any GCB Subsidiary who become
participants in an OFC Compensation and Benefit  Plan shall, for purposes of
determining eligibility for and for any applicable  vesting periods of such
employee benefits only (and not for benefit accrual  purposes unless
specifically set forth herein) be given credit for meeting  eligibility and
vesting requirements in such plans for service as an employee  of  GCB or GC
Bank or any predecessor thereto prior to the Effective Time, provided, 
however, that credit for prior service shall not be given for any purpose
under  the OFC ESOP, and provided further, that credit for benefit accrual
purposes  will be given only for purposes of OFC vacation policies or
programs and for  purposes of the calculation of severance benefits under any

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

 

 

 

 


 

severance  compensation plan of OFC. This Agreement shall not be construed
to  limit the ability of OFC or Oritani Savings Bank to terminate the
employment  of  any employee or to review employee benefits programs from
time to time and  to  make such changes (including terminating any program)
as they deem  appropriate.

 

 

7.8.2. In  the event of any termination or consolidation of any GCB health
plan with any  OFC health plan, OFC shall make available to employees of GCB
or any GCB  Subsidiary who continue employment with OFC or a OFC Subsidiary
("Continuing  Employees") and their dependents employer-provided health
coverage on the same  basis as it provides such coverage to OFC employees.
Unless a  Continuing Employee affirmatively terminates coverage under a GCB
health plan  prior to the time that such Continuing Employee becomes eligible
to participate  in the OFC health plan, no coverage of any of the Continuing
Employees or their  dependents shall terminate under any of the GCB health
plans prior to the time  such Continuing Employees and their dependents
become eligible to participate  in  the health plans, programs and benefits
common to all employees of OFC and  their  dependents. In the event of a
termination or consolidation of any GCB  health plan, terminated GCB
employees and qualified beneficiaries will have  the  right to continued
coverage under group health plans of OFC in accordance with  COBRA,
consistent with the provisions below. In the event of any  termination of any
GCB health plan, or consolidation of any GCB health plan  with  any OFC
health plan, any coverage limitation under the OFC health plan due  to  any
pre-existing condition shall be waived by the OFC health plan to the degree 
that such condition was covered by the GCB health plan and such condition
would  otherwise have been covered by the OFC health plan in the absence of
such  coverage limitation. All GCB Employees who cease participating in an 
GCB health plan and become participants in a comparable OFC health plan
shall  receive credit for any co-payment and deductibles paid under GCB's
health plan  for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket  requirements under the OFC health plan, upon substantiation, in a
form  satisfactory to OFC that such co-payment and/or deductible has been 
satisfied.

 

 

7.8.3. The  payments and benefits that would be required to be made under the
employment  and  change in control agreements between (i) GCB and/or GC Bank
and (ii) each of  the  following individuals, Patricia Arnold, Kurt
Breitenstein, Stephen Mauger,  James  Trouwborst, Roger Tully, C. Mark
Campell, George E. Irwin, Mary Smith, Mathew  Rough, and James Rickenberg,
assuming a termination of employment as of November  1, 2007, shall be
calculated in accordance with the principles set forth in  GCB  DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 7.8.3, which includes explanatory detail and analysis as  to  the
method of the calculation of the payments and benefits due. Each  of the
executives referenced in this Section 7.8.3 shall sign an acknowledgement 
and release upon receipt of the payments set forth therein, a form of which 
is  included in GCB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 7.8.3.

 

 

7.8.4.   Any employee of GCB or any GCB Subsidiary who is not a party to an
employment,  change in control or severance agreement or contract providing
severance  payments shall be entitled to receive, upon a termination of
employment in  connection with the Merger, which shall include any
termination (other than  a  termination for cause) of any employee of GCB or
any GCB Subsidiary within  six  months of the Closing Date, two weeks pay
for each year of service with GCB,  with a minimum severance of four, and a
maximum severance of twenty six, weeks' pay.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

62  

 

 

 

 


 

7.8.5. OFC  shall honor the Executive Supplemental Retirement Income
Agreements for C.  Mark  Campbell, and George E. Irwin, effective January 1,
1999, in accordance with  their terms.

 

 

7.8.6. Within  30 days prior to the Effective Time, GC Bank shall, in
accordance with  applicable law and terms of the plan document, take all
action as necessary  to  terminate the Director Supplemental Retirement
Income Agreement for Robert  C.  Soldoveri, dated March 1, 2004 **** (the
"Director SERP"),  including amending the SERP as may be required prior to
December 31, 2007,  in  order to conform such agreement to Code Section 409A
and the regulations and  other guidance issued thereunder ("Treasury
Regulations"). In  accordance herewith, GCB or GC Bank shall provide for the
payment of all  remaining contributions the SERP to the participant or such
participant's  retirement income trust fund (a so-called "secular trust" or
grantor trust  established by the individual participant) at the Effective
Time, in accordance  with Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B). In
addition, within  30 days prior to the Effective Time, GC Bank shall, in
accordance with  applicable law and the terms of the relevant plan documents,
take all action  as  is necessary to terminate the Director Deferred
Compensation Plans of GC Bank,  effective February 1, 1999, which Director
Deferred Compensation Plans are  "account balance plans" within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation Section  1.409A-1(c)(2)(i)(A), and the GC Bank
Directors Emeritus Plans, effective  February 1, 1999, which Directors
Emeritus Plans are "non-account balance plans" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-1(c)(2)(i)(C)  (collectively, the Director Deferred
Compensation Plans and the Directors  Emeritus Plans shall be referred to as
the "Directors  Plans"). In accordance herewith, and prior to the Closing
Date,  GC Bank shall amend the Director Plans in order to conform such plans
to the  Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder.
GCB  and/or GC Bank shall distribute benefits due to the participants under
such  Director Plans at the Effective Time, in accordance with Treasury
Regulation  Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B). GCB and/or GC Bank shall obtain 
from each participant in the Director SERP and in the Director Plans an 
acknowledgement verifying the payments of the amounts due thereunder and 
releasing GCB, GC Bank, OFC and any OFC Subsidiary from any obligations 
thereunder.

 

 

7.8.7. On  the Closing Date, OFC (or if requested by OFC, GCB) shall make the
cash payment  to Anthony M. Bruno, Jr. as set forth in OFC DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 7.8.7 (which  cannot be amended without GCB's written consent) in
full satisfaction of all  obligations under the employment agreement between
GCB and GC Bank and Anthony  M. Bruno, Jr. and under the Executive
Supplemental Retirement Income Agreement  for Anthony M. Bruno, Jr. (the
"Bruno SERP"). Anthony M. Bruno,  Jr. shall execute an acknowledgment of
payment and a release of any further  claims under these agreements, using
the form attached to OFC Disclosure  Schedule 7.8.7. In connection with the
execution of this Agreement,  OFC, Oritani Savings Bank and Anthony M. Bruno,
Jr. shall execute the  non-compete agreement attached to OFC DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 7.8.7. The  parties will take all action to terminate the Bruno SERP
at the Effective Date  following the cash payment set forth above.

 

 

7.9. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance._

 

 

7.9.1.   For a period of six years after the Effective Time, OFC shall
indemnify, defend  and hold harmless each person who is now, or who has been
at any time before  the  date

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

63  

 

 

 

 


 

hereof  or  who becomes before the Effective Time, an officer, director or
employee of  GCB  or a GCB Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") against
all losses, claims,  damages, costs, expenses (including attorney's fees),
liabilities or judgments  or amounts that are paid in settlement (which
settlement shall require the  prior  written consent of OFC, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld) of  or  in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether  civil, criminal, or
administrative (each a "Claim"), in which an Indemnified  Party is, or is
threatened to be made, a party or witness in whole or in part  on  or
arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a 
director, officer or employee of GCB or a GCB Subsidiary if such Claim
pertains  to any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring at or before
the Effective  Time (including, without limitation, the Merger and the other
transactions  contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such Claim is
asserted or claimed  before, or after, the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under  applicable state or Federal law (including OTS
Regulations), OFC's Certificate  of Incorporation and Bylaws, and under GCB's
Certificate of Incorporation or  Charter and Bylaws. OFC shall pay expenses
in advance of the final disposition  of any such action or proceeding to each
Indemnified Party to the full extent  permitted by applicable state or
Federal law (including OTS Regulations) upon  receipt of an undertaking to
repay such advance payments if he shall be  adjudicated or determined to be
not entitled to indemnification in the manner  set forth below. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim  indemnification under this Section 7.9.1
upon learning of any Claim, shall  notify OFC (but the failure so to notify
OFC shall not relieve it from any  liability which it may have under this
Section 7.9.1, except to the extent  such  failure materially prejudices
OFC) and shall deliver to OFC the undertaking  referred to in the previous
sentence.

 

 

7.9.2. In  the event that either OFC or any of its successors or assigns 
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the 
continuing or surviving bank or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii)  transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person,  then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the  successors and assigns of OFC shall assume the obligations set forth in
this  Section 7.9.

 

 

7.9.3. OFC  shall maintain, or shall cause Oritani Savings Bank to maintain,
in effect  for  six years following the Effective Time, the current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies covering the officers
and directors of GCB  (provided, that OFC may substitute therefor policies of
at least the same  coverage containing terms and conditions which are not
materially less  favorable) with respect to matters occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time;  provided, however, that in no event shall OFC be
required to expend pursuant  to  this Section 7.9.3 more than 150% of the
annual cost currently expended by  GCB  with respect to such insurance (the
"Maximum Amount"); _provided, further, _ that if the amount of the annual
premium necessary to maintain or  procure  such insurance coverage exceeds
the Maximum Amount, OFC shall maintain the  most  advantageous policies of
directors' and officers' insurance obtainable for a  premium equal to the
Maximum Amount. In connection with the foregoing, GCB  agrees in order for
OFC to fulfill its agreement to provide directors and  officers liability
insurance policies for six years to provide such insurer  or  substitute
insurer with such reasonable and customary representations as such  insurer
may request with respect to the reporting of any prior  claims.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

64  

 

 

 

 


 

7.9.4. The  obligations of OFC provided under this Section 7.9 are intended
to be  enforceable against OFC directly by the Indemnified Parties and shall
be binding  on all respective successors and permitted assigns of OFC.

 

 

7.10. _Stock  Listing._

 

 

As  of or  prior to the Effective Time, OFC shall list on the Nasdaq (or
such other  national securities exchange on which the shares of the OFC
Common Stock shall  be listed as of the date of consummation of the Merger),
subject to official  notice of issuance, the shares of OFC Common Stock to be
issued in the  Merger.

 

 

7.11. _Stock  and Cash Reserve._

 

 

OFC  agrees at all times from the date of this Agreement until the Merger 
Consideration has been paid in full to reserve a sufficient number of shares 
of  its common stock and to maintain sufficient liquid accounts or
borrowing  capacity to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

 

 

7.12. _Section  16(b) Exemption_

 

 

OFC  and  GCB agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain
GCB Insiders  (as defined below) in connection with the Merger, both prior to
and after the  Effective Time, it is desirable that GCB Insiders not be
subject to a risk  of  liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to
the fullest extent  permitted by applicable law in connection with the
conversion of shares of  GCB  Common Stock into shares of OFC in the Merger,
and for that compensatory and  retentive purpose agree to the provisions of
this  Section 7.12. Assuming that GCB delivers to OFC the GCB  Section 16
Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion prior to the  Effective
Time, the Board of Directors of OFC, or a committee of non-employee 
directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) 
under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter and in any
event  prior to the Effective Time adopt a resolution providing in substance
that  the  receipt by the GCB Insiders (as defined below) of OFC Common
Stock in exchange  for shares of GCB Common Stock, pursuant to the
transactions contemplated hereby  and to the extent such securities are
listed in the GCB Section 16  Information, are intended to be exempt from
liability pursuant to  Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act to the fullest
extent permitted by  applicable law. "GCB Section 16 Information" shall
mean  information accurate in all material respects regarding the GCB
Insiders, the  number of shares of GCB Common Stock held by each such GCB
Insider and expected  to be exchanged for OFC Common Stock in the Merger.
"GCB Insiders" shall mean those officers and directors of GCB who are subject
to the reporting  requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who
are expected to  be subject to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to OFC Common  Stock  subsequent to the Effective Time.

sentence, have its Board of Directors  recommend approval of this Agreement

if such Board of Directors, after  having consulted with and considered the
advice of outside counsel to such  Board, has determined that the making of
such recommendation, or the failure  so  to withdraw, modify or change its
recommendation, could reasonably be expected  to constitute a breach of the
fiduciary duties of such directors under  applicable law; and (iii) cooperate
and consult with GCB with respect to  each of the foregoing matters.

 

 

8.2. _Joint  Proxy Statement-Prospectus._

 

 

8.2.1. For  the purposes (x) of registering OFC Common Stock to be offered to
holders of  GCB  Common Stock in connection with the Merger with the SEC

thereunder (such proxy statement/prospectus in the form mailed  to the GCB
shareholders, together with any and all amendments or supplements  thereto,
being herein referred to as the "Joint Proxy  Statement-Prospectus"). OFC
shall file the Merger Registration  Statement, including the Joint Proxy

Proxy Statement-Prospectus and all required amendments and  supplements
thereto to be mailed to the holders of GCB Common Stock entitled  to  vote
at the GCB Shareholders Meeting hereof at the earliest practicable  time.

becomes aware  that the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Merger
Registration Statement  contains any untrue statement of a material fact or

Proxy  Statement-Prospectus that corrects such misstatement or omission, and
OFC shall  file an amended Merger Registration Statement with the SEC, and
each of GCB  shall mail an amended Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus to the
GCB shareholders.  If requested by OFC, GCB shall obtain a "comfort" letter

8.3. _Regulatory  Approvals._

 

 

Each  of  GCB and OFC will cooperate with the other and use all reasonable
efforts to  promptly prepare all necessary documentation, to effect all
necessary filings  and to obtain all necessary permits, consents, waivers,
approvals and  authorizations of the SEC, the Bank Regulators and any other
third parties  and  governmental bodies necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by  this Agreement. GCB and OFC will furnish each
other and each other's counsel  with all information concerning themselves,

Governmental Entity. OFC shall give GCB and its counsel the  opportunity to
review and comment on each filing prior to its being filed with  a  Bank
Regulator and shall give GCB and its counsel the opportunity to review  and 
comment on all amendments and supplements to such filings and all responses 
to  requests for additional information and replies to comments prior to
their  being  filed with, or sent to, a Bank Regulator.

11.1.4 (provided,  that the party seeking to terminate the Agreement pursuant

Regulatory Approval Date,  if both of conditions (i) and (ii) below are
satisfied and otherwise as provided  in this Section 11.1.10, as follows:

    |  

subject,  however, to the following three sentences: If GCB elects to
exercise  its  termination right pursuant to this Section 11.1.10, it shall

Ratio  to  the following quotient at its sole discretion: (i) the quotient 
determined by dividing the OFC Minimum Calculation Price by the OFC 
Determination Date Market Value, and multiplying the quotient by  the 
product of the Maximum Exchange Ratio and 0.825. If OFC so  elects, it shall
give, within such five business-day period, written  notice to GCB of such
election and the revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon  no termination shall be
deemed to have occurred pursuant to this  Section 11.1.10 and this Agreement
shall remain in full force and  effect in accordance with its terms (except
as the Exchange Ratio  shall  have been so modified).

**AFFILIATES  AGREEMENT**

 

 



 

November  __, 2007

 



 

Oritani  Financial Corp.

 

370  Pascack Street

 

Township  of Washington, New Jersey 07676

 



 

Gentlemen:

 



 

I  have  been advised that I might be considered to be an "affiliate" of
Greater  Community Bancorp ("GCB"), for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of
Rule 145 of  the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the
Securities Act of  1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").

 

 

Oritani  Financial Corp. ("Oritani Financial Corp.") and GCB have entered
into an  Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 13, 2007
(the "Agreement"). Upon consummation of the merger contemplated by the 
Agreement (the "Merger"), I may receive shares of common stock ("Common
Stock")  in exchange for my shares of common stock, par value $0.50 per
share, of GCB  ("GCB Common Stock"). This agreement is hereinafter referred
to as  the "Letter Agreement."

 

 

I  represent and warrant to, and agree with, Oritani Financial Corp. as 
follows:

 

 

1. I  have read this Letter Agreement and the Agreement and have discussed their  requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, pledge,  transfer or otherwise dispose of shares of Oritani Financial Corp. Common Stock,  to the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for GCB.

 

 

2. I  have been advised that any issuance of shares of Oritani Financial Corp. Common  Stock to me pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the SEC. I  have also been advised, however, that, because I may be an "affiliate" of GCB at  the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the stockholders of GCB  and  my disposition of such shares has not been registered under the Securities  Act,  I must hold such shares indefinitely unless (i) such disposition of such shares  is subject to an effective registration statement and to the availability of  a  prospectus under the Securities Act, (ii) a sale of such shares is made in  conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) under the Securities Act, (iii)  a  sale of such shares is made following expiration of the restrictive period  set  forth in Rule 145(d)(2) or (iv) in an opinion of counsel, in form and substance  reasonably satisfactory to Oritani Financial Corp., I am advised that some  other  exemption from registration is available with respect to any such proposed  disposition of such shares.

 

 

3. I  understand and agree that stop transfer instructions will be given to the  transfer agent of Oritani Financial Corp. with respect to the shares of Oritani  Financial Corp. Common

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 


 

Stock  I  receive pursuant to the Merger and that there will be placed on
the certificate  representing such shares, or any certificates delivered in
substitution  therefor, a legend stating in substance:

 

 

The  shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to
which  Rule 145 under the Securities Act applies. The shares represented by 
this certificate may only be transferred in accordance with Rule 145(d) or 
an  effective registration statement or exemption from registration under
the  Securities Act **.**

 

 

4. Unless  a transfer of my shares of the Oritani Financial Corp. Common Stock is a sale  made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d), made following expiration  of the restrictive period set forth in Rule 145(d) or made pursuant to any  effective registration statement under the Securities Act, Oritani Financial  Corp. reserves the right to put an appropriate legend on the certificate issued  to my transferee.

 

 

It  is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate and
be  of no  further force and effect if the Agreement is terminated in
accordance with  its  terms. It is also understood and agreed that this
Letter Agreement  shall terminate and be of no further force and effect and
the stop transfer  instructions set forth above shall be lifted forthwith
upon the delivery by  the  undersigned to Oritani Financial Corp. of a copy
of a letter from the staff  of  the SEC, an opinion of counsel in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory  to  Oritani Financial Corp., or other
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Oritani  Financial Corp., to the effect
that a transfer of my shares of Oritani Financial  Corp. Common Stock will
not violate the Securities Act or any of the rules  and  regulations of the
SEC thereunder. In addition, it is understood and  agreed that the legend set
forth in Paragraph 2 above shall be removed forthwith  from the certificate
or certificates representing my shares of Oritani  Financial Corp. Common
Stock upon expiration of the restrictive period set  forth  in Rule
145(d)(2), so long as Oritani Financial Corp. is then in compliance  with 
SEC Rule 144(c), or if Oritani Financial Corp. shall have received a copy of 
a  letter from the staff of the SEC, an opinion of counsel in form and
substance  reasonably satisfactory to Oritani Financial Corp., or other
evidence  satisfactory to Oritani Financial Corp. that a transfer of my
shares of the  Oritani Financial Corp. Common Stock represented by such
certificate or  certificates will be a sale made in conformity with the
provisions of Rule  145(d), or made pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the  Securities Act.

 

 

5. I  recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i) my spouse,  (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse's occupying my home, (iii) any trust or  estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% beneficial  interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in any similar  capacity and (iv) any corporation or other organization in which I, my spouse  or  any such relative owns at least 10% of any class of equity securities or of  the  equity interest.

 

 

6. I  further recognize that in the event I become a director or officer of Oritani  Financial Corp. upon consummation of the Merger, any sale of Oritani Financial  Corp. Common Stock by me may subject **** me to liability  pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as  amended.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 


 

7. Execution  of this Letter Agreement should not be construed as an admission on my part  that  I am an "affiliate" of GCB as described in the first paragraph of this Letter  Agreement or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that  I  am such an affiliate on or after the date of this Letter Agreement.

  

 

This  Letter Agreement shall be binding on my heirs, legal representative
and  successors.
