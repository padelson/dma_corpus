                               SALE AND PURCHASE

     Section 2.01. Sale and Purchase of Subject Company Stock. On the terms
and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement, the Seller agrees

price to be paid by the Buyer for the Subject Company Stock (the "Purchase
Price") shall be:

          (a) $141,500,000, and

          (b) either (i) plus the amount, if any, by which $8,300,000 exceeds
     the Closing Date Indebtedness or (ii) less the amount, if any, by which
     the Closing Date Indebtedness exceeds $8,300,000, as applicable, and

                                     -2-
<PAGE>

          (c) either (i) plus the amount, if any, by which the Closing Date
     Working Capital exceeds $5,000,000 or (ii) less the amount, if any, by
     which $5,000,000 exceeds the Closing Date Working Capital, as applicable,
     and

          (d) either (i) plus the amount, if any, by which the Closing Date
     338(h)(10) Value exceeds $6,500,000 or (ii) less the amount, if any, by
     which $6,500,000 exceeds the Closing Date 338(h)(10) Value, as
     applicable.

     The Buyer shall pay the Purchase Price by paying the Estimated Purchase
Price at Closing pursuant to Sections 2.04(b) and (d)(i) below, and by
subsequently paying or receiving the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount, as
appropriate, pursuant to Sections 2.05 and 2.06 below.

     Section 2.03. Manner of Determining the Estimated Purchase Price. The
Seller shall deliver to the Buyer in writing, no less than five Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, (i)(A) a good faith estimate of the Closing Date
Indebtedness as of the close of business on the Business Day immediately
preceding the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness") and (B)
a good faith estimate of the Closing Date Working Capital as of the close of
business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the
"Estimated Closing Date Working Capital"), in each case using the most recent
financial information available, (ii) a statement of the calculation of the
estimated Purchase Price using the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness (rather
than the Closing Date Indebtedness) and the Estimated Closing Date Working
Capital (rather than the Closing Date Working Capital) and assuming for
purposes of this estimate that the Closing Date 338(h)(10) Value equals
$6,500,000 (the "Estimated Purchase Price"), (iii) the financial information
used to derive the Estimated Purchase Price, the Estimated Closing Date
Indebtedness and the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital, and (iv) a
certificate signed by an officer or director of the Seller to the effect that
the Estimated Purchase Price, the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness and the
Estimated Closing Date Working Capital were determined in good faith in
accordance with the Adjusted GAAP Principles (as defined below).

     Section 2.04. Closing. The transactions contemplated hereby (other than
those transactions relating to the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount
contemplated in Section 2.05) shall be consummated at a closing (the
"Closing") that shall be held at the offices of Vinson & Elkins L.L.P., 666
Fifth Avenue, 26th Floor, New York, NY 10103, at 9:00 a.m. local time on the
Closing Date. The "Closing Date" shall be: (x) the fifth Business Day after
the later to occur of (i) the date on which the Closing Conditions (other than
the deliveries to be made at Closing by the Seller or the Buyer) have been
fulfilled or waived and (ii) the earlier to occur of (A) the date on which the
City consents (or indicates that no such consent is required) in writing in a
manner reasonably acceptable to the Buyer to the purchase of the Subject
Company Stock by the Buyer pursuant to the terms hereof or unconditionally
terminates (without regard, however, to any condition constituting the Closing
or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) or irrevocably agrees
in writing in a manner reasonably acceptable to the Buyer to terminate the


                                     -3-

          (a) The Seller shall deliver to the Buyer:

     Agreement.

          (b) The Buyer shall pay to the Seller the Estimated Purchase Price,
     less the Escrow Amount, if any, in United States Dollars by wire transfer
     of immediately available funds to the wire transfer address of the
     Seller, which address shall have been designated by the Seller by notice
     to the Buyer on or before the second Business Day before the Closing
     Date.

          (c) The Buyer shall deliver to the Seller:

               (i) the certificate required by Section 9.02(c) of this
     Agreement; and

     releases and substitute guarantees or letters of credit required by
     Sections 7.02 of this Agreement.

          (d) Unless any of the circumstances described in clause (x)(ii)(A)
     of the introductory paragraph of this Section 2.04 shall have occurred:

     the Escrow Amount shall be released as provided in the Escrow Agreement;



                                     -4-
<PAGE>

               (ii) the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer a copy of the Escrow
     Agreement, executed by the Seller, as required by Section 9.03(f) of this
     Agreement;

               (iii) the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller a copy of the Escrow
     Agreement, executed by the Buyer, as required by Section 9.02(d) of this
     Agreement; and

               (iv) each of the Buyer and the Seller shall deliver a copy of
     the Escrow Agreement, executed by such party, to the Escrow Agent, and
     Escrow Agent shall deliver to each such party a copy of the Escrow
     the Agreement executed by the Escrow Agent.

     Section 2.05. Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment Amount. After the
Closing, an additional amount shall be paid, which amount (the "Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount") shall be determined by the Seller and the Buyer in
accordance with this Section 2.05 and Section 2.06. The Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount shall be equal to the sum (whether positive or negative) of
the amounts determined pursuant to subsections (a), (b) and (c) (in each case
whether that amount is positive or negative):

          (a) the Closing Date Working Capital minus the Estimated Closing
     Date Working Capital; plus

          (b) the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness minus the Closing Date
     Indebtedness; plus

          (c) the Closing Date 338(h)(10) Value minus $6,500,000.

     Section 2.06. Procedures for Calculating and Paying the Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount.

          (a) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date but in no event
     later than the 90th day after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare
     or cause to be prepared, and shall deliver to the Seller, the Closing
     Balance Sheet (as defined below) and a schedule setting forth the Buyer's
     calculation of the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount, including a
     worksheet setting forth its calculation of each of the amounts set forth
     in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of Section 2.05, and the Buyer shall
     thereafter provide to the Seller such supporting work papers or other
     supporting information as may be reasonably requested by the Seller. The
     Closing Date Working Capital and the Closing Date Indebtedness shall be
     determined from a balance sheet of the Businesses as of the close of
     business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the
     "Closing Balance Sheet"). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in
     accordance with GAAP applied in a manner consistent with the accounting
     principles and practices applied in the preparation of the AIC Financial
     Statements and ANA Financial Statements; provided, however, that: (i) the
     Closing Balance Sheet shall contain all normal year-end adjustments which
     would be required if the Closing were to occur on the last day of the


                                     -5-
<PAGE>

     Subject Companies' fiscal year; (ii) any receivables or payables owed by
     or owed to the Seller or its Subsidiaries (other than trade payables
     incurred in the ordinary course of business with the Seller's
     Subsidiaries) shall not be reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet; (iii)
     Taxes (including deferred Taxes) shall not be reflected in the Closing
     Balance Sheet; and (iv) the respective amounts included for litigation
     reserves and for any other reserves or any accruals which were determined
     for each of the AIC Balance Sheet and ANA Balance Sheet by subjective
     estimates shall not be changed from the amounts included in the AIC
     Balance Sheet and ANA Balance Sheet except to reflect (A) cash payments
     made subsequent to the date of the AIC Balance Sheet and ANA Balance
     Sheet, and (B) changes in circumstances or events occurring between the
     date of the AIC Balance Sheet and ANA Balance Sheet and the Closing Date,
     but only if such changes either definitively resolve or otherwise
     conclusively establish the amount of the liability exposure with respect
     to which the reserve or accrual in question has been established. GAAP as
     so adjusted by the foregoing provisions (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this
     Section 2.06(a) is referred to herein as the "Adjusted GAAP Principles."
     The Seller shall cooperate with Buyer and make available to Buyer such
     books, records, other information (including work papers) and personnel
     of Seller which Buyer may reasonably request in order to prepare the
     Closing Balance Sheet and any schedules to be delivered pursuant to this
     Section 2.06(a).

          (b) If the Seller shall have any objections to the Buyer's
     calculation of the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount or the elements of or
     the amounts reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet, the Seller shall so
     notify the Buyer no later than the tenth day after delivery of the
     Closing Balance Sheet and any related schedules, whereupon the Buyer and
     the Seller shall endeavor in good faith for a period not to exceed 15
     days from the date of delivery of such notice to resolve their
     differences (the "Differences"). If at the end of the 15-day period the
     parties are unable to resolve any of their Differences, the Seller and
     the Buyer shall submit the calculation and resolution of such Differences
     to Ernst & Young LLP or an Independent Public Accounting Firm of
     recognized national standing in the United States as they may agree in
     writing. If Ernst & Young LLP refuses or fails to serve and the Buyer and
     the Seller have not agreed on an Independent Public Accounting Firm by
     the end of the 15-day period referred to above, the Independent Public
     Accounting Firm shall be selected by lot from those Independent Public
     Accounting Firms of recognized national standing in the United States
     that are willing to act and, if there are no such Independent Public
     Accounting Firms, from the willing Independent Public Accounting Firms of
     recognized regional standing in one or more regions of the United States
     in which a Subject Company has offices (the Independent Public Accounting
     Firm selected pursuant to the foregoing procedures or Ernst & Young LLP,
     as the case may be, the "Accounting Mediator"). The Accounting Mediator
     shall resolve such Differences and such resolution shall be (i) in
     writing and signed by the Accounting Mediator, (ii) delivered to the
     Buyer and the Seller as soon as practicable after the Differences are
     submitted to the Accounting Mediator but not later than the 30th day
     after such submission, (iii) made in accordance with this Agreement and


                                     -6-
<PAGE>

     (iv) conclusive and binding on the parties hereto on the date of delivery
     of such resolution. If the foregoing procedure does not result in the
     selection of an Accounting Mediator or the Accounting Mediator does not
     or is unwilling to resolve all of the Differences on or before the
     expiration of 30 days from the date of submission of the Differences,
     either party shall be entitled for a period of 15 additional days to
     apply for AAA Arbitration of the unresolved Differences, and, if a party
     so applies, the parties shall submit the matter to AAA Arbitration, which
     shall be binding upon the parties. If neither party shall apply for AAA
     Arbitration of the unresolved Differences, the Purchase Price Adjustment
     Amount shall be deemed to be the amount provided by the Buyer to the
     Seller pursuant to this subsection, adjusted to reflect those Differences
     that were theretofore resolved, if any, by the parties or, if applicable,
     by the Accounting Mediator. The fees and expenses of the Accounting
     Mediator or AAA Arbitration or both, if any, shall be borne equally by
     the Buyer and the Seller.

          (c) If the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount as finally determined
     (whether by agreement of the parties, lapse of time or resolution of the
     Differences) is positive, the Buyer shall pay to the Seller the Purchase
     Price Adjustment Amount plus interest from the Closing Date to the Final
     Payment Date, inclusive of each such date, at a per annum floating rate
     of interest equal to the prime rate, as published from time to time in
     the Money Rates section of The Wall Street Journal. If the Purchase Price
     Adjustment Amount as so finally determined is negative, the Seller shall
     pay to the Buyer the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount plus interest for
     the period and at the rate described in the preceding sentence.

          (d) Payment of the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount plus accrued
     interest shall be made by the Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be, to
     the other in United States Dollars by wire transfer of immediately
     available funds to the wire transfer address of the other on the fifth
     Business Day following the date on which the procedures for resolution of
     the Differences in this Section 2.06 have been completed (the "Final
     Payment Date"), which wire transfer address shall be designated by the
     Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be, by notice to the other on or
     before the second Business Day prior to the Final Payment Date; provided
     that if no such notice is delivered by the Seller, the Buyer shall make
     payment to the wire transfer address previously designated by the Seller
     pursuant to Section 2.04(b).

                                 ARTICLE III.

organizational power and authority to own, lease and operate their respective

Subject Company and Subsidiary, (b) the jurisdiction of incorporation or other

or other organizational documents.

     Section 4.03. Approvals and Consents. Except for Legal Requirements set
forth in Schedule 4.03 to the Seller's Disclosure Letter or those Legal
Requirements the noncompliance with which would not prevent a Subject Company
or its Subsidiaries from performing this Agreement in all material respects or

Businesses or, in the case of clauses (v) or (vi) of subsection (a) of this
Section, for any matters that occur in the ordinary course of business of the
Subject Companies and their Subsidiaries and that would not, individually or

     Section 4.06. Title to Properties. Schedule 4.06 to the Seller's
Disclosure Letter contains (a) a list of all real property owned by the

included in Leased Property as defined below) (the "Owned Personal Property"
and, together with the Owned Real Property, the "Owned Property"), other than
any such Owned Personal Property that has been sold or disposed of in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since the date of
such Balance Sheet on which such Owned Personal Property was reflected or that

clear of Liens, other than (i) Liens securing debt, the existence of which is
reflected in the ANA Financial Statements and AIC Financial Statements, (ii)
Permitted Encumbrances, (iii) Liens securing obligations that are permitted to

and AIC Financial Statements (the "Leased Personal Property" and, together
with the Leased Real Property, the "Leased Property"), and enjoy peaceful and
undisturbed possession of the Leased Property, other than (A) any Leased
Personal Property as to which the leases have terminated in the ordinary
course of business without any material liability of the Subject Company or
Subsidiary party thereto since the date of such Balance Sheet on which the

individually or in the aggregate, is not material. There is no pending
condemnation, expropriation, eminent domain or similar proceeding affecting
all or any portion of any Owned Real Property or material Leased Real Property
and, to the Knowledge of the Seller, no such proceeding is threatened. The
Owned Property and the material Leased Property are in good condition
(ordinary wear and tear excepted) and are sufficient to carry on the
Businesses in the ordinary course as currently conducted. All material Leased
Property is leased by a Subject Company or one of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
leases which are valid and enforceable. Each Subject Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has complied in all material respects with the terms of the
leases for material Leased Property to which it is a party and under which it
is in occupancy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the Owned Property and the Leased Property do not include the Subject Company
Intellectual Property.

     Effect on the Businesses and except for Authorizations pursuant to
     Environmental Laws and Regulations (which are addressed in Section 4.14).
     All such Authorizations are in full force and effect and all fees and
     charges payable with respect thereto as of the date of this Agreement

     the Knowledge of the Seller, threatened regarding suspension, revocation

     4.09 to the Seller's Disclosure Letter, each Subject Company and each
     Subsidiary of a Subject Company is in compliance with all Authorizations
     obtained from any Governmental Authority and the Laws and Regulations
     applicable to such Subject Company, Subsidiary and their respective
     Businesses, except for any such noncompliance that would not,

     in force with respect to a Subject Company or Subsidiary of a Subject
     Company.

          (c) Except as disclosed in Schedule 4.11(c) to the Seller's
     Disclosure Letter, there are no pending written proposed deficiencies or

     time on or after May 18, 1999 or (v) granted a power of attorney with
     respect to any Tax matters that would have continuing effect to any
     Subject Company or Subsidiary of a Subject Company after the Closing. No

     income Tax Return other than a group the common parent of which is the
     Seller ("Seller Group") or (ii) has any liability for the Taxes of any
     Person (A) pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any
     comparable provision of state, local or foreign Tax law) other than for
     any member of the Seller Group, or (B) as a transferee or successor, by
     contract or otherwise.

          (h) No Subject Company or Subsidiary of a Subject Company has been a
     party to a Section 355 transaction that could give rise to a Tax
     liability pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code.

          (i) Each Subject Company and each Subsidiary of a Subject Company
     has complied with all registration, reporting, collection and remittance
     requirements in respect of all Canadian federal and provincial sales tax
     legislation, including the Excise Tax Act (Canada), an Act Respecting
     Quebec Sales Tax and the Retail Sales Tax Act (Ontario). To the Knowledge
     of the Seller, there are no amounts outstanding and unpaid for which a
     Subject Company or a Subsidiary of a Subject Company has previously
     claimed a deduction in respect of which section 78 of the Income Tax Act
     (Canada) applies. Except for the Intercompany Indebtedness that will be
     converted to equity or Equity Securities pursuant to Section 6.04 of this
     Agreement, there are no circumstances existing which could result in the
     application of either (i) sections 79 to 80.04 of the Income Tax Act
     (Canada) or (ii) any equivalent provincial provision, to a Subject
     Company or a Subsidiary of a Subject Company where such application could
     have a Material Adverse Effect on the Businesses. The Subject Company
     Stock does not constitute taxable Canadian property for purposes of the
     Income Tax Act (Canada).

          (a) Schedule 4.12(a) to the Seller's Disclosure Letter contains a
     list of all Scheduled Material Contracts, other than Guarantees. The

     party to any Material Contract or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, any
     other party to any Other Designated Contract written notification that
     such Material Contract or Other Designated Contract is not in full force
     and effect, or that a Subject Company or any of its Subsidiaries party to
     such Material Contract or Other Designated Contract or any other party to
     such Material Contract or Other Designated Contract has not performed its
     obligations under such Material Contract or Other Designated Contract to
     date, other than notification of any nonperformance thereof that would
     not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
     Material Adverse Effect on the Businesses. There are no non-written
     Material Contracts or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, non-written Other
     Designated Contracts.

          (b) Schedule 4.12(b) to the Seller's Disclosure Letter contains a
     list of all Guarantees and identifies each surety in such arrangement,
     whether that be the Seller or another member of the Seller Company Group.
     All such Guarantees are legal, valid, binding and in full force and


                                     -17-

     Contracts and Guarantees described in Schedules 4.12(a) and (b) to the
     Seller's Disclosure Letter have been made available to the Buyer. None of
     the Subject Companies or any of their Subsidiaries is in default under or
     has breached any Material Contract or, to the Knowledge of the Seller,
     any Other Designated Contract to which such Subject Company or Subsidiary
     is a party and no act or omission by a Subject Company or Subsidiary of a
     Subject Company has occurred which, with notice or lapse of time or both,
     would constitute a breach or default under any term or provision of any
     Material Contract or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, any Other
     Designated Contract, other than any defaults or breaches or any acts or
     omissions that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
     expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Businesses.

     Section 4.13. Employees.

          (a) Schedule 4.13(a) to the Seller's Disclosure Letter contains a
     list of (i) the names of employees who have entered into employment
     agreements (which are still in effect, except as set forth in Schedule
     4.13(a) to the Seller's Disclosure Letter) with either of the Subject
     Companies or any of their Subsidiaries and each such employee's position,
     (ii) the names of all employees who have entered into Divestiture and

     Knowledge of the Seller, threatened before the National Labor Relations
     Board (or equivalent Canadian Governmental Authority); (ii) there is no
     labor strike or other coordinated labor action actually pending or, to
     the Knowledge of the Seller, threatened against or involving a Subject
     Company or its Subsidiaries; (iii) no grievance is pending against or
     involving a Subject Company or its Subsidiaries, which grievance would,
     individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
     Material Adverse Effect on the Businesses; (iv) no Material Contract
     restricts a Subject Company or its Subsidiaries from relocating, closing
     or terminating any of its operations or facilities, except for matters
     pertaining to collective bargaining agreements or other labor union
     contracts applicable to employees of a Subject Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries; and (v) none of the Subject Companies or their Subsidiaries
     has since May 18, 1999 (or, if later, the date on which the Seller

<PAGE>

     acquired its direct or indirect interest in such Subject Company or
     Subsidiary) experienced any work stoppage or other labor difficulty or
     committed any unfair labor practice in connection with the operation of
     the related Business, which labor practice is actionable under applicable
     Laws and Regulations, other than any work stoppage, labor difficulty or
     labor practice the commission of which would not, individually or in the
     aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
     the Businesses.

     true and complete list of the Benefit Plans. Copies of all such Benefits
     Plans have been made available to the Buyer. The most recent actuarial
     reports and valuation of the assets and liabilities subject to each
     Benefit Plan, to the extent that any such reports or valuations are
     required to be prepared by applicable Laws and Regulations, have been
     made available to the Buyer. Each Benefit Plan, as applicable, has
     received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue
     Service regarding the qualification of such plan under Section 401(a) of
     the Code, and nothing has occurred that would be reasonably expected to
     result in the loss of such qualification.

          (d) (i) No Person, trade or business that is not a Subject Company
     or a Subsidiary of a Subject Company is a participating employer or
     sponsor of any Benefit Plan, (ii) each Benefit Plan has been invested,
     operated and administered in substantial compliance with its governing
     documents and all applicable Legal Requirements, (iii) except to the
     extent of failures that would not result in material liabilities to the
     Subject Companies, their Subsidiaries or the Buyer, the Subject Companies
     and their Subsidiaries have performed all obligations, whether arising by
     operation of Law or by contract, required to be performed by them in
     connection with the Benefit Plans (including payment, when due, of all
     premiums due and owing, to the extent applicable), (iv) there are no
     actions, suits or claims pending (other than routine claims for benefits)
     or threatened against, or with respect to, any of the Benefit Plans or
     their assets, (v) except to the extent of failures that would not result
     in material liabilities to the Subject Companies, their Subsidiaries or
     the Buyer, all contributions required to be made to the Benefit Plans
     pursuant to their terms and the provisions of all applicable Legal

     pending) with respect to any of the Benefit Plans before any Governmental
     Authority, except for routine filings and reports, (viii) the Subject
     Companies and their Subsidiaries are in substantial compliance with all
     applicable Laws mandating benefits for their employees, and (ix) the
     execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
     transactions contemplated hereby will not (A) require any Subject Company
     or any of its Subsidiaries to make a larger contribution to, or pay
     greater benefits or provide other rights under, any Benefit Plan than it
     otherwise would, whether or not some other subsequent action or event
     would be required to cause such payment or provision to be triggered or


                                     -19-
<PAGE>

     (B) create or give rise to any additional vested rights or service
     credits under any Benefit Plan.

          (e) No Subject Company and no Subsidiary of a Subject Company
     currently sponsors or maintains or has at any time sponsored or
     maintained an employee pension benefit plan which is or has been subject
     to Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
     amended ("ERISA"), or any corresponding provision of Canadian law,
     including any "multiemployer pension plan" within the meaning of Section
     3(37) of ERISA.

          (f) There does not currently exist nor could there reasonably be
     expected to exist or be incurred any liability with respect to an ERISA
     Affiliate Plan (as hereinafter defined) which would result or could
     reasonably be expected to result in a material liability for any of the
     Subject Companies or any Subsidiary of a Subject Company. For purposes of
     the preceding sentence, the term "ERISA Affiliate Plan" includes any
     employee benefit plan which is not a Benefit Plan and which is sponsored,
     maintained or contributed to or which has been sponsored, maintained or
     contributed to by any entity which is or was treated as a "single
     employer" with respect to any Subject Company or any Subsidiary of a
     Subject Company under Sections 414(b), 414(c) or 414(m) of the Internal
     Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and which is or was
     subject to Title IV of ERISA including, without limitation, any
     multiemployer pension plan, within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA.

          (g) None of the Seller, any Subject Company or any Subsidiary of a
     Subject Company, or any ERISA Affiliate has incurred or is reasonably
     likely to incur any liability with respect to any plan or arrangement
     that would be included within the definition of "Benefit Plan" hereunder
     but for the fact that such plan or arrangement was terminated before the
     date of this Agreement.

          (h) Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.13(h) to the Seller's
     Disclosure Letter, there are no claims pending against the Seller, any
     Subject Company or any Subsidiary of a Subject Company by any employee,
     former employee, or any beneficiary of any employee or former employee,
     for workers' compensation or similar benefits based on employment related
     illness or injury, nor are there any claims by any such individuals based
     on claims of unfair employment practices, wrongful dismissal, employment
     discrimination or any other violation of Legal Requirements applicable to
     employment matters, including applicable health and safety legislation,
     nor are there any such claims pending under the terms, including the
     grievance procedures of any applicable collective bargaining agreements,
     except in any such case for such claims that would not, individually or
     in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
     Effect on the Businesses.

          (i) Except pursuant to earn-out agreements set forth in Section
     4.13(i) to the Seller's Disclosure Letter and except for minority
     interest holders in any Subject Company or Subsidiary of a Subject


                                     -20-
<PAGE>

     Company, no current or former employee, director or consultant of any
     Subject Company or Subsidiary of a Subject Company holds any equity or
     equity-based rights in Seller, any Subject Company or Subsidiary of a
     Subject Company (including, without limitation, any stock option or
     restricted stock) and no Subject Company or Subsidiary of a Subject
     Company has, or would reasonably be expected to have, any liability in
     respect of any equity or equity-based rights held or formerly held by any
     current or former employee, director or consultant thereof.

          (j) Any and all short term and/or long term liabilities of any
     Subject Company or Subsidiary of a Subject Company in respect of any
     Benefit Plans are fully accrued for and set forth on the ANA Financial
     Statements and/or the AIC Financial Statements, or the ANA Balance Sheet
     and/or the AIC Balance Sheet, as applicable, in accordance with GAAP.

Section 4.14 are the only representations and warranties of the Seller

     Seller, subject to or affected by any threatened action, suit,
     investigation, inquiry or proceeding by or before any Court or
     Governmental Authority under any applicable Environmental Laws and

     reasonably likely to result in any liability or other obligation under
     any applicable Environmental Laws and Regulations, and (vi) there is no
     adopted, final requirement of any Environmental Laws and Regulations,
     including any Authorization pursuant to any Environmental Laws and
     Regulations, applicable to any Subject Company or any Subsidiary thereof
     or any of their operations, which any Subject Company or any Subsidiary
     thereof or any of their operations will be initially required to comply
     with after the date hereof, nor since May 18, 1999 (or, if later, the
     date on which the Seller acquired its direct or indirect interest in such
     Subject Company or Subsidiary), or to the Knowledge of the Seller prior
     to such date, has any Governmental Authority provided any written notice
     to any Subject Company or any Subsidiary thereof that it is evaluating or

     adequate licenses or other rights to the Subject Company Intellectual
     Property Rights, except for such licenses or rights the failure of which

     Subsidiaries does not own any right, title or interest in and to or have
     the right to use any part of the Subject Company Intellectual Property
     Rights.

          (b) To the Knowledge of the Seller, the conduct of the Business of
     each Subject Company and its Subsidiaries as conducted as of the date of
     this Agreement does not infringe any patents, trademarks, trade names,
     service marks or copyrights of others, except such conduct as would not,
     individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
     Material Adverse Effect on the Businesses. The Seller has no Knowledge of
     any claim that any of the Subject Company Intellectual Property Rights or
     any past or current operations of the Subject Companies or their


                                     -23-

     direct or indirect interest in such Subject Company or Subsidiary)
     infringes on any patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks or
     copyrights of any Person, except such conduct as would not, individually
     or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
     Effect on the Businesses. None of the Seller, the Subject Companies or
     their Subsidiaries have received notice, and the Seller has no Knowledge,
     that any Person is infringing upon any of the Subject Company
     Intellectual Property Rights. Except as provided in Section 7.01 of this
     Agreement or as disclosed in Schedule 4.17(b) to the Seller's Disclosure
     Letter, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
     result in the loss or impairment of any Subject Company Intellectual
     Property Rights, except such loss or impairment as would not,
     individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected have a Material
     Adverse Effect on the Businesses.

     Section 4.18. Transactions with Affiliates. Except as set forth in
Schedule 4.18 to the Seller's Disclosure Letter, no member of the Seller
Company Group and none of the officers, directors or employees (or any
relative or spouse of any of the foregoing persons who has the same home as
such person or any other associate of any of the foregoing persons) of a
Subject Company, has any interest, directly or indirectly, in any lease, Lien,
contract, license, encumbrance, loan or other agreement or commitment to which
a Subject Company or any Subsidiary of a Subject Company is a party, or any
property or asset used or owned by, or any interest in any supplier of, a
Subject Company or any Subsidiary of a Subject Company (any of the foregoing,
a "Related Party Contract"), other than the employment agreements and
Retention Bonus and Divestiture Agreements set forth in Schedule 4.13(a) to
the Seller's Disclosure Letter and any Related Party Contract that has an
aggregate value of $10,000 or less or may be terminated by the Subject Company
or Subsidiary of a Subject Company that is a party thereto upon not more than
30 days' notice to the other party or parties thereto. Except as set forth in
Schedules 4.13(a) or 4.18 to the Seller's Disclosure Letter and except for the
Intercompany Indebtedness and wages and employee benefits owed in the ordinary
course of business, neither a Subject Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
indebted, directly or indirectly, to (a) the Seller (other than in respect of
items (and amounts) fully disclosed in the AIC Financial Statements and ANA
Financial Statements) or (b) any officer, director or employee of a Subject
Company or any Subsidiary (or any associate of a person described in clauses
(a) or (b)) for any liability or obligation, whether arising by reason of
stock ownership, oral or written agreement or understanding or otherwise.

     Section 4.19. SEC Filings. All forms, reports and documents filed with
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") by the Seller
since June 9, 1999, to the extent (and only to the extent) that they contain
disclosure regarding the Subject Companies and their Subsidiaries, did not, at
the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light


                                     -24-

of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the
Subject Companies or any of their Subsidiaries is required to file any forms,
reports or other documents with the SEC.

                                     -30-
<PAGE>

     not unreasonably interfere with the operation of the facility or the
     personnel involved.

          (b) All information provided to the Buyer and its Representatives
     pursuant to this Section 6.03(a) and all information made available to
     the Buyer in any data room (including the internet data room) pertaining

contains a list of the names and positions of certain of the employees of the

to the Closing, the Seller shall transfer, or shall cause the appropriate
member of the Seller Company Group to transfer, to the Subject Companies and
their Subsidiaries those employees designated in Schedule 6.05 to the Seller's
Disclosure Letter to be transferred.

     Section 6.06. Covenants Not to Compete.

          (a) In consideration of the Buyer entering into this Agreement and
     in order that the Buyer may enjoy the full benefits of the Businesses,
     the Seller covenants and agrees that, for two years after the Closing
     Date, the Seller shall not directly or indirectly, whether as principal,
     agent, partner, officer, director, stockholder, employee, consultant or
     otherwise (except as provided below), whether alone or in association
     with any other Person, own, manage, operate, control, participate in,
     perform services for, or otherwise carry on, a business which designs,
     produces, manufactures, markets, distributes or sells products or
     services that are identical or substantially similar to products or
     services designed, produced, manufactured, marketed, distributed or sold,
     as the case may be, or proposed as of the Closing Date to be designed,
     produced, manufactured, marketed, distributed or sold by the Subject
     Companies or any of their Subsidiaries in the operation of the Businesses
     in the geographic areas within the United States and Canada in which the
     Subject Companies and their Subsidiaries are conducting the Businesses as
     of the date of this Agreement. The Seller and Buyer agree that the
     foregoing covenant is intended to prohibit the Seller from engaging in
     such activities, as the case may be, as owner, creditor (except as a
     trade creditor in the ordinary course of business), partner, stockholder
     or lender (except as a holder of equity or debt securities in a
     corporation a class of whose securities is publicly traded on any stock
     exchange or recognized over-the-counter market, and then only to the
     extent of owning not more than five percent of the issued and outstanding
     debt or equity securities of such corporation), contractor or agent for
     any Person.



                                     -31-
<PAGE>

          (b) The Seller further covenants and agrees that for a period of two
     years after the Closing Date, it shall not, either directly or
     indirectly, on its own behalf or in the service or on behalf of others,
     solicit, hire or attempt to solicit or hire any employee of the Buyer;
     provided, however, that the Seller shall not be precluded from hiring any
     employee of the Buyer who (i) initiates discussions regarding employment
     with the Seller without any direct or indirect solicitation or
     encouragement by the Seller, (ii) responds to any advertisement to the
     general public placed by the Seller, or (iii) has been terminated, or has
     been notified that he or she will be terminated, by the Buyer prior to
     the commencement of employment discussions between the Seller and such
     employee.

          (c) The Seller acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law for
     any breach, or threatened breach, of any of the provisions of this
     Section 6.06 will be inadequate and, accordingly, the Seller covenants
     and agrees that the Buyer shall, in addition to any other rights and
     remedies which the Buyer may have, be entitled to equitable relief,
     including injunctive relief, and to the remedy of specific performance
     with respect to any breach or threatened breach of such covenant, as may
     be available from any court of competent jurisdiction. Such right to
     obtain equitable relief may be exercised, at the option of the Buyer,
     concurrently with, prior to, after, or in lieu of, the exercise of any
     other rights or remedies which the Buyer may have as a result of any such
     breach or threatened breach.

          (d) In the event that the provisions of this Section 6.06 shall be
     determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable under
     applicable Law as to that jurisdiction (the parties agreeing that such
     decision shall not be binding, res judicata or collateral estoppel in any
     other jurisdiction) for any reason whatsoever, then any such provision or
     provisions shall not be deemed void, but the parties hereto agree that
     said limits may be modified by the court and that said covenant contained
     in this Section 6.06 shall be amended in accordance with said
     modifications, it being specifically agreed by the Seller and Buyer that
     it is their continuing desire that this covenant be enforced to the full
     extent of its terms and conditions or if a court finds the scope of the
     covenant unenforceable, the court should redefine the covenant so as to
     comply with applicable Law.

     Section 6.07. Insurance. To the extent that (a) there are third-party
insurance policies maintained by the Seller and its Affiliates ("Seller's
Insurance Policies") covering any loss, liability, damage, expense or other
risk relating to the assets, businesses, operations, conduct, products and
employees (including former employees) of any of the Businesses (all such
losses, liabilities, claims, damages, expenses or risks, regardless of the
availablility of insurance coverage, are herein referred to collectively as
the "Liabilities") and relating to or arising out of occurrences prior to the
Closing, and (b) the Seller's Insurance Policies continue to permit claims
after the Closing ("Claims") to be made with respect to such Liabilities
relating to or arising out of occurrences prior to the Closing, the Seller
agrees to cooperate and cause its Affiliates to cooperate with the Buyer and
the Subject Companies in submitting, and to submit and cause its Affiliates to


                                     -32-

submit, Claims on behalf of the Buyer or the Businesses under the Seller's
Insurance Policies with respect to such Liabilities relating to or arising out
of occurrences prior to the Closing, provided that the Buyer shall bear the
burden of all deductibles related to any such Claims. From and after the
Closing Date, the Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, pay over to
the Buyer, or reimburse the Subject Companies and their Subsidiaries, for all
amounts actually paid to the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller on behalf of
the Subject Companies and their Subsidiaries following the Closing under the
Seller's Insurance Policies and relating to periods ending on or prior to the
Closing (excluding any refunds of premium payments). From and after the
Closing Date, the Seller and its Affiliates shall be entitled to retain, or
the Buyer and its Affiliates shall pay over to the Seller and its Affiliates,
any refunds of premium payments payable or attributable to the Subject
Companies and their Subsidiaries following the Closing under the Seller's
Insurance Policies and relating to periods ending on or prior to the Closing.

                            COVENANTS OF THE BUYER

     Section 7.01. Corporate Name. The Buyer shall not acquire, nor shall a
Subject Company or any of its Subsidiaries retain, any right or license to the
name "Azurix" or "Enron" (or any variation thereof) or any trademarks, trade
names or symbols related thereto. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing (and in any event, not later than the 120th day thereafter with
respect to the matters in clause (a) below and not later than the 180th day
thereafter with respect to the matters in clause (b) below), the Buyer will
cause each Subject Company and each Subsidiary of a Subject Company (a) to
amend its organizational documents to the extent necessary to remove the
"Azurix" and "Enron" names (and any variation thereof) from the name of such
Subject Company or Subsidiary, and (b) to remove all trademarks, trade names
and symbols related to the names "Azurix" and "Enron" from the properties and
assets (including all signs) of such Subject Company or Subsidiary and
otherwise to cease all use of or right to use the terms "Azurix" and "Enron"
and any marks or names which include other of such terms, or any other terms
which are confusingly similar thereto.

     Section 7.02. Guarantees. The Buyer acknowledges the list of Guarantees
set forth on Schedule 4.12(b) to the Seller's Disclosure Letter and agrees,
(i) in the case of any such Guarantee that is a letter of credit, to
substitute for the existing letter of credit a letter of credit issued by a
financial institution selected by the Buyer and acceptable to the beneficiary
of the existing letter of credit and (ii) in the case of any such Guarantee
that is not a letter of credit, to use its commercially reasonable efforts
prior to the Closing to cooperate with the Seller to terminate such Guarantee
(including offering to substitute a guarantee of the Buyer or one of its
Subsidiaries for such Guarantee) and procure from the existing obligee the
release of the member of the Seller Company Group that is a party to such
Guarantee from any and all liability from and under such Guarantee, which
release shall be acceptable to the existing obligee and shall take effect at
the Closing. To the extent that the Seller is not able to terminate any such
Guarantee (other than a letter of credit) and obtain any such release prior to
the Closing in accordance with clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, the
Buyer agrees (a) to continue to use its commercially reasonable efforts
thereafter to effect such a termination and release and (b) to provide to the


                                     -33-
<PAGE>

Seller at the Closing a letter of credit issued by a financial institution
reasonably acceptable to the Seller against which the appropriate members of
the Seller Company Group may draw to the extent of any Losses that such
members of the Seller Company Group may incur or suffer as a result of being
required to perform any obligations under, or to defend against any claim made
or threatened to be made in connection with, any such Guarantees from and
after the Closing. To the extent that any such letter of credit is
insufficient to cover any such Losses, the Buyer agrees to defend, indemnify
and hold harmless, from and after the Closing, the Seller Company Group of,
from and against any such Losses. This indemnification shall be in addition to
the indemnification provided pursuant to Article X and shall not be subject to
the thresholds, deductibles or other limitations on amount set forth in
Section 10.02(a).

     or shall cause the Subject Companies and their respective Subsidiaries to
     maintain, compensation, severance and employee benefit plans and
     arrangements for employees of the Subject Companies and their respective
     Subsidiaries that are no less favorable than those provided pursuant to
     the Benefit Plans in effect as of the date hereof and set forth in
     Schedule 4.13(c) to the Seller's Disclosure Letter, provided that to the
     extent permitted by applicable Law, the Buyer, the Subject Companies and
     their respective Subsidiaries shall have the same right to modify, amend
     or terminate such compensation, severance or employee benefit plan or
     arrangements, or to terminate the employment of any employee, as the
     Seller, the Subject Companies or their respective Subsidiaries have on
     the date of this Agreement. For purposes of eligibility, accrual of
     benefits (providing that such service shall not be taken into account for
     purposes of determining accrual of benefits under any defined benefit
     pension plan maintained by Buyer), participation and vesting under
     compensation, severance and employee benefit plans provided by the Buyer
     or, after the Closing, the Subject Companies and their respective
     Subsidiaries to employees of the Subject Companies and their respective
     Subsidiaries, service as an employee of a Subject Company, a Subsidiary
     of a Subject Company or a member of the Seller Company Group (which
     service shall include service as an employee of a predecessor of any such
     entity) shall be deemed to be service as an employee of the Buyer or,
     after the Closing, the Subject Companies and their respective
     Subsidiaries.

this Section 8.01 shall apply to the parties hereto from and after the date of
this Agreement until the Closing:

          (a) Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
     to cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or to cause to be done, all
     things, including the making of all necessary filings and thereafter any
     other required submissions, that are necessary, proper or advisable under

     advisors prior to filing and, if requested, shall accept all reasonable
     additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith. Each
     party shall furnish or cause to be furnished all information required for
     any application or other filing to be made in connection with obtaining
     any such Authorizations.

          (b) Each party shall timely give, and shall cause their respective
     Subsidiaries, as applicable, to give, any notices to third Persons and
     shall use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, to
     use, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, (i) in the case of the
     Seller, the Third Person Consents set forth in Schedule 3.03 or Schedule

     consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) the
     occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event that would be likely to cause
     any of the Closing Conditions of any other party not to be satisfied or
     of any other change that is reasonably likely to cause a breach of the
     covenants of such party under this Agreement or to delay or impede the
     ability of any party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement or to fulfill their respective obligations set forth herein. No
     delivery of any notice pursuant to clause (iv) of this subsection (c)
     shall cure any breach of any representation or warranty of the party
     giving such notice contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or
     affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
     notice.



                                     -35-
<PAGE>

          (d) Each party hereto agrees to cooperate with the others and to use
     commercially reasonable efforts vigorously to contest and resist any
     action, including legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to
     have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order (whether
     temporary, preliminary or permanent) of any Court or Governmental
     Authority that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits the
     consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
     including the vigorous pursuit of all available avenues of administrative
     and judicial appeal and all available legislative action.

          (e) The Seller and the Buyer each agree that the terms and
     provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated
     herein by reference and that such terms and provisions shall continue in
     full force and effect until the Closing, except as otherwise provided in
     Section 11.02(c).

     Section 8.02. Public Announcements. Each party shall consult with each
other party before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation with and approval from the others. No party shall permit any of
its Subsidiaries to make any press release or public statement with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Section 8.02 shall not preclude a party from issuing press releases or making
other public statements, including filings with or applications to
Governmental Authorities, that such party in good faith reasonably believes to
be required under applicable Legal Requirements, in which case such party
shall consult with the others prior to issuing such press release or making
such statement.

     Section 8.03. Taxes.

          (a) Transfer Taxes. Each party hereto shall cooperate with the other
     party in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns,
     questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real
     property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer and stamp taxes, any
     transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar taxes
     that become payable as a direct result of the sale of the Subject Company
     Stock by the Seller to the Buyer in the manner contemplated by this
     Agreement ("Transfer Taxes"), and each of the Buyer and the Seller shall
     be responsible for, and shall timely pay, 50% of the total amount of such
     Transfer Taxes. The party responsible for such preparation, and filing of
     such documents shall be determined as required by Law or consistent with
     local custom in the jurisdiction in which such filing is to occur.

          (b) Allocation of Tax Liability. The Buyer and the Seller shall,
     unless prohibited by applicable Law, close the taxable period of each
     Subject Company and Subsidiary of a Subject Company as of the close of
     the Closing Date. In any case where applicable Law prohibits a Subject
     Company or Subsidiary of a Subject Company from closing its taxable
     period on the Closing Date, any Taxes attributable to a taxable period
     that includes but does not end on the Closing Date will be allocated for
     the account of the Seller for the period up to and including the Closing


                                     -36-
<PAGE>

     Date and for the account of the Buyer for the period subsequent to the
     Closing Date, on the basis of an interim closing of the books of each
     Subject Company and Subsidiary of a Subject Company as of the close of
     the Closing Date. All transactions occurring on the Closing Date but
     after the Closing shall have occurred shall be reported on the Buyer's
     consolidated United States federal income Tax Return to the extent
     permitted by Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) and shall
     be similarly reported on other Tax Returns of the Buyer or its
     Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) property
     Taxes shall be allocated between the Seller and the Buyer on a daily
     basis over the period beginning on the date that ownership of the
     property results in imposition of the Tax and ending on the day before
     the next date that ownership of the property results in imposition of the
     Tax; and (ii) franchise, doing business and capital Taxes shall be
     allocated between the Buyer and the Seller on a daily basis over the
     period for which payment of the Tax provides the right to engage in
     business.

          (c) Tax Sharing Agreements. The Seller and each Subject Company
     shall cause each tax sharing agreement, arrangement or practice between
     any of the Subject Companies and their Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
     the Seller Company Group, on the other hand (collectively, the "Tax
     Sharing Agreements"), to be terminated as of the Closing Date as it
     pertains to any of the Subject Companies and their Subsidiaries, and
     thereafter the obligations of the parties and their Affiliates, as
     related to the Subject Companies and their Subsidiaries, shall be
     governed exclusively by this Agreement.

          (d) Tax Returns.

               (i) For all taxable periods of the U.S. Companies ending on or
     prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall cause the U.S. Companies to
     join in the Seller's consolidated federal income Tax Returns and, with
     respect to any taxing authority requiring or permitting combined
     reporting with the Seller or any of its Affiliates, to join in combined
     Tax Returns for such jurisdictions, in accordance with current practices
     (unless the Buyer, in its sole discretion, consents to any changes from
     current practices), and the Seller shall pay or cause to be paid all
     Taxes with respect to such taxable periods. Except as required by Section
     8.03(g), in no event shall the Seller take any position on such Tax
     Returns that could have the effect of increasing the Buyer's Taxes after
     the Closing Date without the Buyer's consent, which consent shall not be
     unreasonably withheld.

               (ii) The Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and shall
     file or cause to be filed all other Tax Returns of each Subject Company
     and Subsidiary of a Subject Company for taxable periods ending on or
     before the Closing Date that are filed after the Closing Date, and shall
     pay or cause to be paid all Taxes with respect to such taxable periods.
     The Buyer shall make available to the Seller such books and records of


                                     -37-
<PAGE>

     the Subject Companies and their Subsidiaries as are reasonably necessary
     to file such Tax Returns, and the Buyer shall cause authorized officers
     of the Subject Companies and their Subsidiaries to execute such Tax
     Returns, where required, provided that such Tax Returns have been
     prepared in accordance with applicable Law. Except as required by Section
     8.03(g), in no event shall the Seller take any position on such Tax
     Returns that could have the effect of increasing the Buyer's Taxes after
     the Closing Date without the Buyer's consent, which consent shall not be
     unreasonably withheld.

               (iii) The Buyer shall cause the Subject Companies and their
     Subsidiaries to file all Tax Returns for their taxable periods ending
     after the Closing Date. To the extent that any such Tax Return is to be
     filed with respect to a taxable period of any such Subject Company or
     Subsidiary of a Subject Company that begins before and ends after the
     Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the Buyer shall provide such Tax
     Return (a "Straddle Period Tax Return") to the Seller for the Seller's
     review at least 30 days prior to the deadline for filing such Tax Return.
     With respect to each Straddle Period Tax Return, the Buyer and the Seller
     shall work in good faith to determine the portion of the Tax attributable
     to the period prior to and including the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing
     Tax") and the portion of the Tax attributable to the period after the
     Closing Date (the "Post-Closing Tax"). Not later than five days prior to
     the due date for filing such Straddle Period Tax Return, the Seller shall
     pay to the Buyer the amount of the Pre-Closing Tax determined to be owed
     with respect to such Straddle Period Tax Return.

          (e) Refunds. If after the Closing Date the Buyer or any Subject
     Company or Subsidiary of a Subject Company or any of their Affiliates
     receives a refund of any Tax attributable to a taxable period (or portion
     thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, the Buyer shall pay to the
     Seller within 15 days after such receipt an amount equal to such refund
     received (or so much of such refund as relates to the portion of the
     taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date), together with any
     interest received or credited thereon. The Seller shall cooperate with
     the Buyer and the Subject Companies, to the extent reasonably requested,
     in filing claims for refunds of Taxes (other than Taxes attributable to a
     consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return which included a Subject
     Company or Subsidiary of a Subject Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period)
     relating to the carryback of a net operating loss or other Tax attribute
     from a Tax period ending after the Closing Date; provided that all costs
     related to the filing of such a claim for refund shall be borne by the
     Buyer and any claims for Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period arising from
     or attributable to such carryback shall be the obligation of the Buyer
     and shall not be subject to indemnification by the Seller.

          (f) Section 338(h)(10) Elections. The Seller and Buyer shall make a
     joint election under section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any similar
     election under any applicable state income tax law (collectively, the
     "Section 338(h)(10) Elections") with respect to the Buyer's purchase of
     the Subject Company Stock. Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the
     Buyer and the Seller, working together in good faith, shall agree upon an


                                     -38-
<PAGE>

     allocation of the Purchase Price and the liabilities of the Subject
     Companies (plus other relevant items) in accordance with Treasury
     Regulations promulgated under Section 338 of the Code (the "Purchase
     Price Allocation"). Not later than 120 days after the Closing Date, the
     Buyer shall prepare, consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation, and
     deliver to the Seller an Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 and any
     similar form under applicable state income tax law (the "Forms") with
     respect to the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, together with any completed
     schedules required to be attached thereto. The Seller shall have 20 days
     following receipt thereof to review and comment on the Forms and
     schedules. Not later than 10 days after such review and comment has been
     completed or, if any changes are required to be made to the Forms, not
     later than 10 days after receipt of the final versions of such Forms, the
     Seller shall return such Forms to the Buyer, which Forms shall have been
     duly executed by an authorized person for the Seller. The Buyer shall
     cause the Forms to be duly executed by an authorized person for the
     Buyer, shall provide a copy of the executed Forms to the Seller, and
     shall duly and timely file the Forms as prescribed by Treasury Regulation
     1.338(h)(10)-1 or the corresponding provisions of applicable state income
     tax law. The Seller and the Buyer agree to file all Tax Returns and
     information reports in a manner consistent with the Purchase Price
     Allocation.

          (g) Consistency. Any Tax Return to be prepared pursuant to the
     provisions of Section 8.03(d) shall be prepared in a manner consistent
     with practices followed in prior years with respect to similar Tax
     Returns, except for changes required by changes in Law or fact.

          (h) Resolution of Disputes. If the Seller and the Buyer are unable
     to agree upon (i) the amount of the Pre-Closing Tax owed with respect to
     a Straddle Period Tax Return prior to the date that is 15 days prior to
     the due date for filing such Straddle Period Tax Return, or (ii) the
     allocation of the Purchase Price and liabilities of the Subject Companies
     (plus other relevant items) within the time specified in subparagraph (f)
     hereof, the parties shall submit such matter to the Accounting Mediator,
     as defined in Section 2.06(b), or if no Accounting Mediator has been
     selected, the parties shall select such an Accounting Mediator for this
     purpose in the manner provided in Section 2.06(b), and the decision of
     such Accounting Mediator shall be binding on the parties. Each of the
     Seller and the Buyer shall bear 50% of the fees and other costs charged
     by such Accounting Mediator with respect to such matter.

     Section 8.04. Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
all costs and expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date by the Seller and
the Subject Companies and their Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Seller and the
Subject Companies and their Subsidiaries, and all costs and expenses incurred
by the Buyer and the Parent, respectively, in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Buyer and the
Parent, respectively.

     Section 8.05. Post-Closing Matters.

          (a) From and after the Closing, each party hereto agrees to execute
     such further instruments or documents as any other party may from time to
     time reasonably request in order to confirm or carry out the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that no such
     instrument or document shall increase a party's liability beyond that
     contemplated hereby.

          (b) From and after the Closing, the Buyer shall cause the Subject
     Companies and their Subsidiaries to maintain copies of all Books and
     Records in the possession of the Subject Companies and their Subsidiaries
     at the time of the Closing and shall prevent the Subject Companies and
     their Subsidiaries from destroying any of such Books and Records for a
     period of five years following the Closing without first allowing the
     Seller, at the Seller's expense, to make copies of the same. During that
     period, the Buyer shall cause the Subject Companies and their
     Subsidiaries, (i) to grant to the Seller and its Representatives
     reasonable cooperation and access at all reasonable times and upon
     reasonable notice to all of such Books and Records relating to the period
     prior to the Closing (including workpapers and correspondence with taxing
     authorities) that are not otherwise protected by legal privilege, (ii) to
     afford the Seller and its Representatives the right, at the Seller's
     expense, to take extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof and (iii)
     to have access to the employees of the Subject Companies and their
     Subsidiaries, all to the extent reasonably necessary or appropriate for
     general business purposes, including the preparation of interim financial
     statement reviews, year end financial statement audits and Tax Returns
     and the handling of tax audits, disputes and litigation; provided,
     however, that such requested cooperation, access and assistance shall not
     unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Subject
     Companies and their Subsidiaries.

          (c) To the extent that the Buyer shall, directly or indirectly, sell
     or otherwise transfer its interests in a Subject Company or any
     Subsidiary of a Subject Company subsequent to the Closing, the Buyer
     agrees to use all reasonable efforts to obtain from the transferee of
     such interests an obligation to comply with the provisions of subsection
     (b) of this Section, which obligation shall be enforceable by the Seller
     as a third party beneficiary.

          (d) If any party shall fail to obtain prior to the Closing any Third
     Person Consent set forth, (i) in the case of the Seller, in Schedule 3.03
     or Schedule 4.03 to the Seller's Disclosure Letter and (ii) in the case
     of the Buyer, in Schedule 5.03 to the Buyer's Disclosure Letter, such
     party shall thereafter use all reasonable efforts, and shall take any
     such actions reasonably requested by any other party, to limit the
     adverse effect upon the parties, their respective Subsidiaries and the
     Businesses or that would be likely to result after the Closing from the
     failure to obtain such consent; provided that the provisions of this
     Section 8.05(d) shall not apply to the failure of Seller to obtain the
     consent of the City to this transaction, it being agreed that the sole
     consequences of such failure under this Agreement shall be as provided in
     Section 10.02(e) and in the Escrow Agreement.

                                INDEMNIFICATION

     Section 10.01. Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements.

          (a) Except as set forth in subsection 10.01(b) and Article XI of
     this Agreement, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
     of each party hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect
     regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any other party
     hereto, any Person controlling any such party or any of their
     Representatives whether prior to or after the execution of this
     Agreement.

          (b) The representations and warranties of the Seller contained in
     Articles III and IV, those of the Buyer contained in Article V and those
     of the Parent contained in Section 12.02 shall survive the Closing and
     any investigation by the parties with respect thereto but shall terminate
     and be of no further force or effect after the expiration of 18 months
     after the Closing Date, except that such time limitation shall not apply
     to: (i) the representations and warranties in Section 4.05(a) (regarding
     the beneficial ownership of Equity Securities), which shall survive
     through the applicable statute of limitations or (ii) the representations
     and warranties in Sections 4.11, 4.13 and 4.14, which shall survive until
     the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
     foregoing, any such representation or warranty as to which a bona fide
     claim relating thereto is asserted in writing (which states with
     specificity the basis therefor) in accordance with Section 10.03 during
     such survival period shall, with respect only to such claim, continue in
     force and effect beyond such survival period pending resolution of the
     claim. The covenants and agreements in this Article X shall survive the
     Closing and shall remain in full force and effect for such period as is
     necessary to resolve any bona fide claim made with respect to any
     representation or warranty contained in this Agreement during the
     applicable survival period thereof. The remaining covenants and
     agreements of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement (other than
     those covenants and agreements that are expressly required to remain in
     full force and effect only until the Closing or until some other
     specified time) shall survive the Closing without any contractual
     limitation on the period of survival.

     Section 10.02. General Indemnification.

          (a) If the transactions contemplated hereby to occur at the Closing
     are effected and subject to the provisions of Section 10.01(b), each of
     the Buyer and the Parent, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other
     hand, hereby agrees (each, in such capacity, an "Indemnifying Party"),
     from and after the Closing, to indemnify and hold harmless the others and
     their respective officers, directors and Affiliates (each, in such
     capacity, an "Indemnified Party") against any single or series of related
     demands, claims, audits, investigations, hearings, complaints, suits,
     proceedings, actions or causes of action, assessments, losses, damages,
     liabilities, costs and expenses and judgments, and amounts paid in
     settlement (including interest, fines and penalties and reasonable
     attorneys' fees incurred in connection therewith) (collectively,
     "Losses") that such Indemnified Party shall actually incur, to the extent


                                     -43-
<PAGE>

     that such Losses (or actions, suits or proceedings in respect thereof and
     any appeals therefrom ("Proceedings")):

               (i) arise out of or are based upon a breach of any
     representation or warranty made herein in Articles III or IV by the
     Seller (other than any representation or warranty set forth in Section
     4.11, the sole remedy for any breach of which is provided in Section
     10.02(b)) which are all for the benefit of the Buyer (in which case the
     Seller shall be the Indemnifying Party), in Article V by the Buyer which
     are all for the benefit of the Seller (in which case the Buyer shall be
     the Indemnifying Party) or in Section 12.02 by the Parent which are all
     for the benefit of the Seller (in which case the Parent shall be the
     Indemnifying Party);

               (ii) arise out of or are based upon a breach of any covenant or
     agreement made herein for the benefit of the Indemnified Party by the
     Indemnifying Party; or

               (iii) result from a demand, claim, investigation, hearing,
     complaint, suit, proceeding, action or cause of action asserted or
     threatened in writing by a Governmental Authority or other third party to
     the extent based on events or circumstances that would have constituted a
     breach of a representation or warranty set forth in Section 4.14(a)
     without regard to the limitations contained in Section 4.14(a) based on
     the Knowledge of the Seller;

     provided, however, that the Seller shall be liable for Losses under
     clauses (i) and (iii) above relating to Section 4.14(a) and incurred for
     an investigation, cleanup, remediation, removal, modification,
     installation, replacement or restoration of property, equipment or
     improvements only to the extent that such Losses are incurred in a
     reasonably cost-effective manner to comply with, or prudently manage
     obligations under, any applicable Environmental Laws and Regulations (it
     being understood that the foregoing proviso shall not preclude or
     diminish any liability by the Seller for any Loss incurred in a
     reasonably cost-effective manner to satisfy any judicial, administrative
     or arbitration judgment, decree, order, award or other resolution).

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not have any
     liability to the Indemnified Party under this Section 10.02(a) unless and
     until the aggregate amount of all Recoverable Losses (as defined below)
     exceeds $1,000,000, in which event only the amount in excess of
     $1,000,000, shall be recoverable; and the liability of the Indemnifying
     Party under this Section 10.02(a) shall not exceed 35% of the Purchase
     Price in the aggregate. The amount of any Loss incurred by an Indemnified
     Party hereunder shall be calculated without regard to any materiality or
     "Material Adverse Effect" qualifier contained in the representations and
     warranties in this Agreement, and shall be offset by (i) the proceeds of
     any insurance received by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto and
     (ii) the amount of any income tax benefit actually realized by the


                                     -44-
<PAGE>

     Indemnified Party with respect thereto; provided that, the determination
     of the amount of any Tax benefit actually realized with respect to a Loss
     by an Indemnified Party shall be made by the Indemnified Party in its
     sole discretion, acting in good faith. Notwithstanding anything to the
     contrary in this Agreement, a "Recoverable Loss" shall mean any single
     Loss or related series of Losses arising out of any single act, omission,
     event or circumstance if such single Loss or related series of Losses
     exceeds $50,000 (and, if such a single Loss or related series of Losses
     is incurred, the entire amount of such single Loss or related series of
     Losses shall be a Recoverable Loss).

          (b) In addition to the foregoing, the Seller agrees, from and after
     the Closing, to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer and its officers,
     directors and Affiliates against any Losses to or of the Buyer and its
     officers, directors and Affiliates to the extent such Losses arise out of
     or are based upon (i) any Taxes of any Subject Company or Subsidiary of a
     Subject Company attributable to or apportioned to any Pre-Closing Tax
     Period, whether such Taxes become due prior to, on, or after the Closing
     Date; (ii) any Tax liability attributable to the making of the Section
     338(h)(10) Elections pursuant to Section 8.03(f) of this Agreement; (iii)
     any Tax liability of any Person other than a Subject Company or
     Subsidiary of a Subject Company with respect to which any Subject Company
     or Subsidiary of a Subject Company (A) is severally liable for any Taxes
     of any consolidated, combined, unitary, or similar Tax group of which any
     Subject Company or Subsidiary of a Subject Company was a member on or
     before the Closing Date pursuant to Treasury Regulationss.1.1502-6 or any
     analogous state, local, or foreign tax provision, (B) is liable to such
     Person pursuant to any agreement or arrangement, or (C) is a successor to
     such Person by merger, liquidation or other transaction and (iv) the
     breach of a representation or warranty set forth in Section 4.11. This
     indemnification shall be the sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing
     for all Losses relating to Taxes, including for a breach of the
     representations and warranties in Section 4.11, and shall not be subject
     to the thresholds, deductibles and other limitations on an amount set
     forth in Section 10.02(a).

          (c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 10.02 to the
     contrary, the Seller shall not be liable for any Losses resulting from a
     breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in Article
     III or IV of this Agreement to the extent that:

               (i) the liability for such breach occurs or is increased as a
     result of the adoption or imposition of any Law or Regulation not in
     force at the date of this Agreement or as a result of any increase in
     rates of taxation after the date of this Agreement (it being understood
     that this shall not relieve the Seller of any liability arising under
     Section 4.14(a)(vi) it may have regarding any Law or Regulation in effect
     on or prior to the date of this Agreement, compliance with which will be
     initially required after the date hereof); or



                                     -45-
<PAGE>

               (ii) the Losses would not have arisen but for a change in
     accounting policy or practice of the Buyer, the Parent or any member of
     any Subject Company Group after Closing.

          (d) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, and to the
     fullest extent permitted by Law, the Buyer hereby agrees, from and after
     the Closing, to indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Seller
     Company Group and its Representatives against any Losses incurred by such
     Person to the extent that such Losses arise out of or are based upon the
     ownership and operation of the Subject Companies and their Subsidiaries
     from and after the Closing Date and not resulting from any condition or
     circumstance for which the Buyer would be entitled to indemnification
     under Section 10.02(a) without regard to any of the thresholds or
     deductibles or other limitations on amount set forth in Section 10.02(a).
     This indemnification shall be in addition to the indemnification provided
     under Section 10.02(a) and shall not be subject to the thresholds,
     deductibles and other limitations on amount set forth in Section
     10.02(a).

          (e) In addition to the foregoing, the Seller agrees, from and after
     the Closing, to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer, the Subject
     Companies and their Subsidiaries against any Losses incurred in any
     Proceeding brought by the City to the extent that such Losses arise out
     of or are based upon a breach of Section 21.01 of the Hamilton-Wentworth
     Agreement. This indemnification shall be in addition to the
     indemnification provided under Section 10.02(a) and shall not be subject
     to the thresholds, deductibles and other limitations on amount set forth
     in Section 10.02(a).

     Section 10.03. Procedures.

          (a) Promptly after receipt by the Indemnified Party under Section
     10.02 of notice of a Loss or the commencement of any Proceeding against
     which it believes it is indemnified under this Article, the Indemnified
     Party shall, if a claim in respect thereto is to be made against the
     Indemnifying Party under this Article, notify the Indemnifying Party in
     writing of the commencement thereof; provided, however, that the omission
     to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability
     that it may have to the Indemnified Party to the extent that the
     Indemnifying Party is not prejudiced by such omission.

          (b) The Indemnifying Party shall, on or before the 30th day after
     receipt of a notice of Loss or Proceeding given pursuant to subsection
     (a) of this Section, either (i) acknowledge liability, as between the
     Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, for such Loss or the amount
     in controversy in such Proceeding and pay the Indemnified Party the
     amount of such Loss or the amount in controversy in such Proceeding in
     immediately available funds (or establish by agreement with the
     Indemnified Party an alternative payment arrangement), (ii) acknowledge
     liability, as between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party,
     for such Loss or the amount in controversy in such Proceeding but disavow
     the validity of the Loss or Proceeding or the amount thereof and, in the
     case of a Proceeding to the extent that it shall so desire in accordance


                                     -46-
<PAGE>

     with subsection (d) of this Section, assume the legal defense thereof or
     (iii) object (or reserve the right to object until additional information
     is obtained) to the claim for indemnification or the amount thereof,
     setting forth the grounds therefor in reasonable detail. If the
     Indemnifying Party does not respond to the Indemnified Party as provided
     in this subsection within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party
     shall be deemed to have acknowledged its liability for such
     indemnification claim in accordance with clause (i) of this subsection
     and the Indemnified Party may exercise any and all of its rights under
     applicable Law to collect such amount.

          (c) An Indemnifying Party will not, without the prior written
     consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
     withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
     with respect to any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which
     indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not
     the Indemnified Party is an actual or potential party to such Proceeding)
     unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
     release of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
     Proceeding. If the Indemnifying Party has responded to the Indemnified
     Party pursuant to clause (i) of subsection (b) of this Section, the
     Indemnified Party may settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
     judgment with respect to the Proceeding that was the subject of notice to
     the Indemnifying Party pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section without
     the consent of the Indemnifying Party (but no such settlement, compromise
     or consent shall increase the indemnification obligation of the
     Indemnifying Party to which it has consented pursuant to clause (i) of
     subsection (b) of this Section). Except as otherwise provided in the
     immediately preceding sentence and in subsection (d) of this Section, an
     Indemnified Party will not, without the prior written consent of the
     Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
     settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
     to any pending or threatened Proceeding, but, if such Proceeding is
     settled or compromised or if there is entered any judgment with respect
     to any such Proceeding, in either case with the consent of the
     Indemnifying Party, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in
     any such Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify and hold
     harmless any Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability by
     reason of such settlement, compromise or judgment.

          (d) If a Proceeding shall be brought against an Indemnified Party
     and it shall notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in accordance with
     subsection (a) of this Section, the Indemnifying Party shall, if it shall
     have responded to such notice in accordance with clause (ii) of
     subsection (b) of this Section be entitled to assume the legal defense
     thereof. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate
     counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but
     the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the
     Indemnified Party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have
     been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party, (ii)
     the Indemnifying Party shall have failed to assume the defense of such
     action or (iii) the named parties to any such Proceeding (including any
     impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Party and the


                                     -47-
<PAGE>

     Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party shall have been advised by
     such counsel that there is one or more legal defenses available to it
     that are different from or additional to those available to the
     Indemnifying Party. In any such case, the Indemnifying Party shall not,
     in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar
     or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same
     general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses
     of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local
     counsel) for the Indemnified Party. Except as aforesaid, after notice
     from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to
     assume the defense of such claim or such action, the Indemnifying Party
     shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party under this Section for any
     attorneys' fees or other expenses (except reasonable costs of
     investigation) subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
     connection with the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party does not
     or cannot assume the defense of a Proceeding as to which it has
     acknowledged liability, as between itself and the Indemnified Party,
     pursuant to clause (ii) of subsection (b) of this Section, the
     Indemnified Party may require the Indemnifying Party to reimburse it on a
     current basis for its reasonable expenses of investigation, reasonable
     attorneys' fees and expenses and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
     incurred in the defense thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall be bound
     by the result obtained with respect thereto by the Indemnified Party.

          (e) In the case of a Loss as to which the Indemnifying Party shall
     have responded pursuant to clause (iii) of subsection (b) above, the
     parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve their differences for a
     period of 60 days following receipt by the Indemnified Party or Parties
     of the response of the Indemnifying Party pursuant to subsection (b)
     above and, if the parties are unable to resolve their differences within
     such period, the Indemnified Party or Parties may submit the matter to
     judicial proceedings.

     Section 10.04. Consequential Damages. Except to the extent any such
damages may arise from a third party claim with respect to which a party
hereto is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, no party to this
Agreement nor any of its Representatives shall be liable to any other party
hereto or any of its Representatives for claims for punitive special,
exemplary or consequential damages, including damages for loss of profits,
loss of use or revenue or losses by reason of cost of capital, arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
regardless of whether a claim is based on contract, tort (including
negligence), strict liability, violation of any applicable deceptive trade
practices act or similar Law or any other legal or equitable principle, and
each party releases the other and its Representative from liability for any
such damages. No party shall be entitled to rescission of this Agreement as a
result of breach of any other party's representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements, or for any other matter.

     Section 10.05. Sole Remedy. From and after the Closing, the provisions of
this Article X and the indemnification provisions set forth in Sections 3.05,
5.06 and 7.02 of this Agreement, in each case subject to the limitations set
forth therein, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of each party hereto for
(i) any breach of a party's representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement or (ii) any breach of a party's covenants or agreements contained in


                                     -48-
<PAGE>

this Agreement. The Buyer, the Seller and the Parent are the only parties
entitled to exercise any remedy provided by this Article X.

     Section 10.06. Tax Effect of Payments. The parties agree that any
indemnification payment made pursuant to this Article X shall be treated for
Tax purposes as an adjustment of the Purchase Price unless otherwise required
by applicable Law.

                                 ARTICLE XI.
                       TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

     Section 11.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time

     pursuant to this Section 11.01(d) shall in no event be the party that
     causes such transactions to not be consummated by such date due to an
     inability to satisfy its Closing Conditions because it, and, in the case
     of the Buyer, it or the Parent, willfully and intentionally breached its
     representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
     Agreement to prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
     herein.

     Section 11.02. Effect of Termination.

          (a) Except as set forth in Sections 11.02(b) and 11.02(c), in the
     event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.01,

     effect and there shall be no liability or obligation hereunder on the
     part of any party or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives to any
     other party.

          (b) Upon a termination by the Seller under Section 11.01(b) or by
     the Buyer or the Parent under Section 11.01(c), if the breach giving rise
     to the right to terminate was committed willfully and intentionally by a
     party to prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
     herein, the terminating party shall be entitled to all remedies available
     at Law or in equity, subject to Section 10.04.

          (c) The provisions of this Section 11.02 and of Sections 1.01, 1.02,

     survive any termination under Section 11.01. In addition, the
     Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in
     accordance with its terms. Upon request of the other party, each party
     shall return to the other party all documents and other materials
     furnished by the other party relating to the transaction contemplated

     after the date of this Agreement.

     Section 11.03. Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, any party hereto
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of any other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of any other party contained herein or in any document delivered

                                 ARTICLE XII.
                               FINANCIAL SUPPORT

     Section 12.01. Guarantee of Parent. The Parent hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees to the Seller the due and punctual payment by the Buyer
(and its permitted assigns) of all amounts payable to the Seller under Article
II and Section 7.02 of this Agreement. If the Buyer shall fail or be unable to
pay such amounts as and when the same shall become due and payable, the Parent
shall be obligated to pay or cause to be paid such amounts to the Seller in
accordance with the terms hereof. This guaranty is a guaranty of payment,
performance and compliance and not of collectibility and is in no way
conditioned or contingent upon any attempt to collect from or enforce
performance or compliance by the Buyer or upon any other event or condition
whatsoever.

     Section 12.02. Representation and Warranties Regarding Parent. The Parent
represents and warrants to the Seller that:

          (a) Organization and Qualification; Capitalization. The Parent is a
     legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
     the Laws of Delaware. The Parent is the beneficial owner of all of the
     issued and outstanding Equity Securities of the Buyer.

          (b) Authorization of Agreement. The Parent has all requisite
     corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
     perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
     contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery by the Parent of this
     Agreement and the performance by the Parent of its obligations hereunder
     have been duly and validly authorized by all requisite corporate action
     on the part of the Parent and no other corporate proceedings on the part
     of the Parent are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
     by this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
     the Parent and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof
     by the Seller and the Buyer) constitutes the legal, valid and binding
     obligations of the Parent, enforceable against the Parent in accordance
     with its terms, except as enforcement hereof may be limited by
     bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium
     and other similar Laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of
     creditors' rights generally and legal principles of general applicability
     governing the availability of equitable remedies (whether considered in a
     proceeding in equity, at law or under otherwise applicable Law).



                                     -51-
<PAGE>

          (c) Approvals and Consents. Except for Legal Requirements the
     noncompliance with which would not prevent the Parent from performing
     this Agreement in all material respects, no filing or registration with,
     no waiting period imposed by and no Authorization of any Governmental
     Authority is required under any Legal Requirement applicable to the
     Parent to permit the Parent to execute, deliver or perform this Agreement
     or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. No Third Person
     Consent is required to permit the Parent to execute, deliver and perform
     this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

          (d) No Violation. Upon effectuation of all filings and registrations
     with, termination or expiration of any applicable waiting periods imposed
     by and receipt of all Authorizations of any Governmental Authority,
     neither the execution and delivery by the Parent of this Agreement nor
     the performance by the Parent of its obligations hereunder (i)(A)
     violates or breaches or causes a default under any of the terms of any
     Legal Requirement applicable to the Parent, (B) contravenes the
     certificate of incorporation, bylaws or any other organizational document
     of the Parent or (C) violates or breaches or causes a default or gives
     rise to any right of termination, purchase or amendment under any of the
     terms, conditions or provisions of any indenture, loan, credit agreement
     contract, agreement, written commitment, license or other instrument to
     which the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the
     Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its properties or assets are
     bound or affected or (ii) will, with the passage of time, the giving of
     notice or the taking of any action by a third Person, have any of the
     effects set forth in clause (i) of this Section 12.02(d), except in any
     such case for any matters described in this Section 12.02(d) that would
     not prevent the Parent from performing this Agreement.

     Section 12.03. Financial Support of Seller. If at any time after the
Closing and prior to the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, (a) any
Person other than the Seller or one of its Subsidiaries shall become the
beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of a
majority or more of the outstanding securities of Wessex, (b) the Seller shall
sell all or substantially all of the assets of Wessex to a Person other than a
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Seller (other than in connection with a bona
fide financing transaction involving the retention of operations and control
of such assets by Seller or a Subsidiary of Seller that does not materially
dilute the benefits to the Buyer set forth in this Section 12.03), (c) a
liquidation or dissolution shall occur with respect to Wessex or (d) the
credit ratings assigned to the debt of Wessex by any of Standard & Poor's,
Moody's Investors Service and Fitch, Inc. as of the Closing Date shall have
been downgraded to a credit rating below BBB+, A3 and A-, respectively, then
the Seller shall promptly provide as financial support for its obligations
under this Agreement, at its sole election, either (i) a letter of credit
issued by a financial institution reasonably acceptable to the Buyer in an
amount equal to 35% of the Purchase Price less any amounts previously paid to
the Buyer pursuant to Section 10.02(a) of this Agreement as of the date of
first occurrence of an event specified in clauses (a), (b), (c) or (d) and
through the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, or (ii) a guaranty from
Enron Corp. of the Seller's obligations under this Agreement substantially
similar to the guarantee provided in Section 12.01.

Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or

parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

     Section 13.03. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the
Annexes hereto, the Seller's Disclosure Letter and the Buyer's Disclosure
Letter) constitutes the entire agreement of the parties, and supersedes all
prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties,

hereto may not be assigned, and the obligations of any party hereto may not be
delegated, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other
party, which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably; provided, however,
that the Buyer may assign this Agreement, or any interest herein, and may
delegate any duty or obligation hereunder, without the consent of the Seller,
to one or more Affiliates of the Buyer if the Buyer reasonably ensures that,
at the time of such assignment or delegation, any such Affiliate is adequately
capitalized and appropriately staffed to be able to discharge the duties and
obligations so assigned or delegated; and provided, further, that,
notwithstanding any such assignment or delegation, the Buyer and the Parent
shall not be released from any, and shall remain liable for all, of their
respective obligations under this Agreement and the guaranty under Section
12.01 shall apply to the applicable obligations of the assignee. This
Agreement may also be assigned by operation of Law. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment of this
Agreement in violation of this Section 13.04 shall be null and void.

Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

     Section 13.06. Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver. No failure or delay on
the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall
impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any

shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or
further exercise thereof or of any other right.

     Section 13.07. Disclosure Letters. Each of the Seller's Disclosure Letter

relevance is readily apparent on its face.

to validity and performance) and enforced in accordance with, and governed by,
the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be
performed wholly within such jurisdiction.

     Section 13.09. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

     Section 13.10. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended only by a written
instrument executed by the parties.

     Section 13.11. Disclaimer. Except for the representations and warranties
expressly contained in Articles III and IV of this Agreement, the Seller does
not make any express or implied representation or warranty, including with

Businesses or the Subject Company Stock. The Seller and the Buyer agree that,
to the extent required by applicable Law to be effective, the disclaimers of
the representations and warranties contained in this section are
"conspicuous."
