Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, New Castle County. The name of the Corporation&#146;s registered agent at such address is The Corporation Trust Company. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">THIRD: The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General
Corporation Law of Delaware (the &#147;DGCL&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">FOURTH: The capital stock of the Corporation shall consist of 2,000 shares of Common
Stock with a par value of $0.01 per share, of which, 1,000 shares shall be Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and 1,000 shares shall be Class B Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock of the Corporation shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote, in

furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation, subject to any specific limitation on such power contained in any Bylaws
adopted by the stockholders. Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the Corporation so provide. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">SIXTH:
No person who is or was a director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or
limitation thereof is not permitted by the DGCL as the same exists or hereafter may be amended. If the DGCL is hereafter amended to authorize corporate action further limiting or eliminating the liability of directors, then the liability of a
director to the Corporation or its stockholders shall be limited or eliminated to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or amendment of this Section Six of the Certificate of Incorporation by the stockholders of the
Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Section Six will, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or
change in law permits the Corporation to further limit or eliminate the liability of directors) and shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of
such inconsistent provision with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision. </P>

otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a &#147;proceeding&#148;), including, without limitation, proceedings by or in the right of
the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter a &#147;Covered Person&#148;), whether the basis of
such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the
fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability and loss (including, without limitation, attorneys&#146; fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and
penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such Covered Person in connection with such proceeding, and such right to indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee
or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Covered Person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred by this Section Seven shall be a contract right and shall
include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition. The rights conferred on any Covered Person by this Section Seven shall not be
exclusive of any other rights which any Covered Person may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. Any repeal or amendment of
this Section Seven by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Section Seven, will, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective
only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or
protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision. This Section Seven shall
not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than Covered Persons. </P>
