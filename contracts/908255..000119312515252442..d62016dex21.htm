a result thereof: (i) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and

the effects set forth in this Agreement and specified in the DGCL.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company

Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, which shall comply with _Section
5.9(b)_, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

Section 1.2 _Effective Time_. At the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ")
to be duly executed and filed, in accordance with the DGCL, with the Secretary

recordings required in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at the time such Certificate of Merger shall have been duly filed
with, and accepted by, the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such
later date and time as is agreed upon by the Parties and specified in
the Certificate of Merger (such date and time hereinafter referred to as the
" _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.3  _Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will

2 Section 1.4 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The

certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable Laws.

 

ARTICLE II

MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OF STOCK

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Company Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or
Merger Sub or any holder of any securities of any of the foregoing:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub,
par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation, par value $0.01 per share.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each outstanding or issued Share that is owned
by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or by any Subsidiary of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company, immediately prior to the Effective Time (except to the
extent held by any such person on behalf of a third party) (collectively, the
" _Excluded Shares_ "), shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and no cash, stock or other consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares)
shall automatically be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount,
without interest, equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration. As of the
Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry
Shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (other than Dissenting Shares and Excluded
Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except, in
all cases, the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without
interest, in accordance with _Section 2.2_, and each Certificate formerly
representing Dissenting Shares (and each Dissenting Share that is a Book-Entry
Share) shall thereafter only represent the right to receive the payment to
which reference is made in _Section 2.2(i)_. The right of any holder of any
Share to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be subject to and
reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable
Tax Law.

(d) _Company Stock Awards_. The Company shall take all requisite action so
that:

 

(i) Each option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to
purchase Shares (" _Company Stock Option_ ") under any stock option plan of
the Company, including the Remy International, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan and
any other plan agreement or arrangement of the Company (collectively, the "
_Company Equity_  

 



3   _Plan_ "), shall, at the Effective Time, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, be fully vested and
canceled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such canceled Company
Stock Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the
cancellation of such Company Stock Option and in settlement therefor, a
payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (i) the vested portion
of the total number of Shares subject to such canceled Company Stock Option
and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Per Share Merger Consideration over
(B) the exercise price per Share subject to such canceled Company
Stock Option, without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the " _Option
Payments_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any such Company Stock Option
with respect to which the exercise price per Share subject thereto is equal
to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be canceled in
exchange for no consideration and (ii) such Option Payments may be reduced by
the amount of any required Tax withholdings. The Option Payments shall be made
in accordance with _Section 2.2(j)_. From and after the Effective Time, no
Company Stock Option shall be exercisable and each Company Stock Option shall
only entitle the holder thereof to the payment provided for in this  _Section
2.1(d)(i)_.

(ii) Each stock appreciation right outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time under the Company Equity Plan (a " _Company SAR_ "), shall, at
the Effective Time, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, be fully vested and canceled and, in exchange therefor,
each holder of any such canceled Company SAR shall be entitled to receive, in
consideration of the cancellation of such Company SAR and in settlement
therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (i) the
vested portion of the total number of Shares subject to such canceled Company
SAR and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Per Share Merger Consideration
over (B) the base price per Share subject to such canceled Company SAR,
without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the " _SAR Payments_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any such Company SAR with respect to which
the base price per Share subject thereto is equal to or greater than the Per
Share Merger Consideration shall be canceled in exchange for no consideration
and (ii) SAR Payments may be reduced by the amount of any required Tax
withholdings. The SAR Payments shall be made in accordance with _Section
2.2(j)_. From and after the Effective Time, no Company SAR shall be
exercisable and each Company SAR shall only entitle the holder thereof to the
payment provided for in this Section 2.1(d)(ii).

 

(iii) Each award of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that is subject to forfeiture or other restrictions (" _Restricted Shares_ ")
granted pursuant to a Company Equity Plan shall, at the Effective Time,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be fully vested (with any performance-based vesting conditions
treated as vested at the target performance level) and all restrictions
(including forfeiture restrictions) otherwise applicable to such vested Shares
shall lapse and such Shares shall be converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_. Payments to
the holders of Restricted Shares pursuant to this Section 2.1(d)(iii) shall be
made in accordance with _Section 2.2(j)_.

 

(iv) Each restricted stock unit award and each other right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive payments measured by the value
of Shares,

 



4  and each award of any kind consisting of Shares that may be held, awarded,
outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the Company Equity Plan,
other than Company Stock Options, Company SARs and Restricted Shares (a "
_Company Phantom Award_ "), shall, at the Effective Time, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be fully vested
(with any performance-based vesting conditions treated as vested at the
target performance level) and cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder
of such Company Phantom Award shall be entitled to receive, in consideration
of the cancellation of such Company Phantom Award and in settlement therefor,
a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of
Shares subject to such Company Phantom Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest
(such amounts payable hereunder, the " _Phantom Payments_ ") _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such Phantom Payments may be reduced by the amount of any
required Tax withholdings. The Phantom Payments shall be made in accordance
with  _Section 2.2(j)_, _provided_ , _that_ , with respect to any Company
Phantom Awards that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to
Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be paid at the
Effective Time without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the
Code, such payment shall be made at the earliest time permitted under the
applicable Stock Plan and award agreement that will not trigger a Tax or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

(v) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt any resolutions
and take any actions that are necessary to (x) effectuate the treatment of
the Company Stock Options, Company SARs, Restricted Shares and Company Phantom
Awards (collectively, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") pursuant to  _Section
2.1(d)(i)_ through _Section 2.1(d)(iv)_ and (y) cause the Company Equity Plan
to terminate at or prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or
other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement
of Company Equity Awards.

 

(vi) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to cause, and shall amend
the Remy International, Inc. 2015 Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the " _Company ESPP_ ") as may be necessary to provide that the Company ESPP
shall be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and no
purchase period shall commence after the date of this Agreement.

(e) _Anti-Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the
number of outstanding Shares shall have been changed into a different number
of Shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, business combination,
tender or exchange offer, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a
stock dividend or stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record
date within said period, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Shares the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) in no event shall the aggregate amount payable by Parent
pursuant to _Section 2.2_ after giving effect to any such event exceed the
amount that would have been payable

 



5  pursuant to _Section 2.2_ had such event not occurred and (ii) nothing in
this _Section 2.1_ shall permit the Company to take any action with respect
to its securities that is expressly prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

Section 2.2 _Disposition of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_. 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall appoint a U.S.-based
nationally recognized bank or trust company to act as paying agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration to the
holders of the Shares. Parent will enter into a paying agent agreement with
the Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ ") on terms reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company prior to the Closing. Prior to or at the
Closing, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in immediately
available funds in the amount necessary for payment in accordance with
_Section 2.1_ and this _Section 2.2_ of the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement (such total deposited cash
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Paying Agent
shall make payments of the Per Share Merger Consideration out of the Payment
Fund in accordance with this Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement. The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(b) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
representing ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such Shares except
as otherwise provided for herein. From and after the Effective Time, any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Paying Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation for any reason (other than Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares representing Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled
and exchanged for the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of
such Shares pursuant to this _Article II_. 

(c) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) As soon as possible after the Effective Time (and in any event within
three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate
or Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) (A) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass to the Paying Agent,
only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree) and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Per Share Merger
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled. Upon surrender of any
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount of cash in immediately
available funds equal to (x) the

 



6  number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (less any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.2(h)_), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash
payable pursuant to this _Section 2.2_.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder
of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
_Article II_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-
Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an
"agents message" in customary form (or such other documentation or evidence,
if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive,
and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger
Consideration in respect of each such Share (less any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.2(h)_), and the Book-Entry Shares of
such holder shall forthwith be cancelled.

 

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund which
remains unclaimed for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of Shares prior to the
Effective Time who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and only as
general creditors thereof for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws).

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation,
the Company or the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent,
representative or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect
of the Per Share Merger Consideration from the Payment Fund properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

 

(f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment
Fund as directed by Parent (on behalf of the Surviving Corporation);
_provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or
P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively or in funds investing solely in such obligations
that provide for same day liquidity. Any net profit resulting from, or
interest or income produced by, such investments shall be paid to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent (at Parents election). To the extent that
there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Payment Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash
payments of the aggregate Per Share 

 



7  Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace
or restore the portion of the Payment Fund required so as to ensure that the
Payment Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such
payments.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by
Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable and customary amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof,
pursuant to this Agreement.

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 

(i) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. Such
holders shall be entitled to receive such consideration as is determined to be
due with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under the Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid
such consideration as is determined to be due pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable
solely for the right to receive, the Per Share Merger Consideration, without
interest and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under
applicable Tax Law. The Company shall promptly deliver to Parent notice of any
written demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. The Company shall not without the prior written
consent of Parent make any payment with respect to (unless required by a
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a final non-
appealable order), or offer to make any such payment or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands.

not later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date not less than five
Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall pay
the Option Payments, SAR Payments, Phantom Payments and the payments to the
recipients of Restricted Shares due pursuant to  _Section 2.1(d)(i), Section
2.1(d)(ii),_ _Section 2.1(d)(iii)_ and _Section 2.1(d)(iv)_, respectively,
through its payroll systems.

deliver this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and, subject, in the case of the Merger,

outstanding Shares entitled to vote thereon (the " _Company
Stockholder Approval_ "), to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company (other than the Company

Company are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, subject, in the case of the
consummation of the Merger, to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and
to the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware as required by the DGCL. Each of this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming the due authorization and the valid execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the Voting Agreement by the other parties
hereto and thereto constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except
to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally or by general principles
of equity).

 

(b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has unanimously (i)
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, (ii) determined that this

Company and its stockholders (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) (such

securities of the Company is necessary to consummate any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement other than the Merger.

the Acquired Companies pursuant to the terms of, any Material Contract or
other Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
except in the case of _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ above, as, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company,
and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby,
do not require any consent, approval, order, authorization or permit of,

Section 3.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and (vi) as, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

 

Section 3.5 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed or furnished, as applicable,
all forms, reports, statements, schedules, certifications and other documents
(including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) required to be
filed or furnished by them with or to the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since January 1, 2013 (all such forms,
reports, statements, schedules, certificates, documents, exhibits and other
information incorporated therein, collectively, the " _Company SEC Documents_
"). As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of the last
such amendment, each of the Company SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (" _SOX_ "), and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, as the case may be, each as in effect on the date so filed or
furnished, as applicable. Except to the extent that information in any Company
SEC Document has been amended, revised or superseded by a Company SEC
Document subsequently filed or furnished (any such amendment, revision or
superseding document with respect to a Company SEC Document filed or furnished
prior to the date hereof having also been filing or furnished prior to the
date hereof), none of the Company SEC Documents contains any untrue statement
of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated or
incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not

 



13  misleading. No Subsidiary of the Company is subject to the periodic
reporting requirements of the Exchange Act or of any foreign Governmental
Entity that performs a similar function to that of the SEC or of any
securities exchange or quotation system.

(b) The consolidated annual and quarterly financial statements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including any related notes thereto) that are
included in the Company SEC Documents (i) comply as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable
thereto and (ii) present fairly in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the respective dates
thereof and the consolidated results of their operations, cash flows and
changes in stockholders equity for the periods indicated therein (subject,
in the case of unaudited financial statements, to notes and normal year-end
audit adjustments), in each case in conformity with United States generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto).

 

(c) The Company (i) maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" and
"internal control over financial reporting" (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and (ii) as of the date of
this Agreement, has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date of this Agreement, to the Companys outside auditors and the audit
committee of the Company Board (A) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of such internal control over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
the Companys internal control over financial reporting. The Companys
"disclosure controls and procedures" are reasonably designed to ensure that
all material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded and
reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation
of the Companys filings with the SEC. The Companys management has completed
an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX,
and based on Company managements most recent such assessment prior to the
date of this Agreement, the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of the Company concluded that such controls were effective. The
Companys system of "internal control over financial reporting" (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is reasonably sufficient in all
material respects to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that Company transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial
statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP, and
that receipts and expenditures of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being
made only in accordance with the authorization of management, and (iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that would materially affect the consolidated financial
statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



14 (d) Since January 1, 2013, (i) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the
Company which was then a reporting company under the Exchange Act, nor to the
knowledge of the Company, any director, officer or outside auditor of the
Company or any such Subsidiary, has received or otherwise had or obtained
knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether
written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices and (ii) no attorney
representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their officers, directors,
employees or agents to the Company Board or any committee thereof (or the
board of directors of the Companys predecessor as a public company or any
committee thereof) or to any director or executive officer of the Company (or
of its predecessor as a public company).

(e) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of all
written comment letters from the staff of the SEC received from January 1,
2013 to the date of this Agreement relating to the Company SEC Documents and
all written responses of the Company or its Subsidiaries thereto other than
with respect to any requests for confidential treatment. As of the date of
this Agreement, (i) there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment
letters received from the SEC staff with respect to any Company SEC Documents
and (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Documents
(other than any confidential treatment requests) is under ongoing SEC review.
As of the date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of the Company, there are
no SEC inquiries or investigations or other governmental inquiries or
investigations pending or threatened, in each case regarding any accounting
practices of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 3.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise, required by GAAP to be set forth on a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company, except for liabilities and
obligations (a) reflected or reserved against in the Companys consolidated
balance sheet as at December 31, 2014 (or the notes thereto), (b) incurred in
the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2014, (c) incurred in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (d) that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.7 _Proxy Statement; Company Information_. The information relating
to the Company and its Subsidiaries to be contained in the Proxy Statement
and any other documents filed with the SEC in connection with this Agreement
will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of
applicable Law, and will not, on the date the Proxy Statement is first
mailed to holders of Shares or at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading at the time and in light of the
circumstances under which such statement is made, except that no
representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements
made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by
Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

 



15 Section 3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. From and including January

in a breach of clauses _(b)_ _(ii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ , _(ix)_ , _(xii)_ ,
_(xiv)_ ,  _(xv)(A)_ (changing, for this purpose, the reference therein to
"$200,000" to "$250,000") and excluding any Company Equity Awards granted in

 (other than actions taken in the ordinary course of business consistent with

for this purpose, the reference therein to "$200,000" to "$250,000"), _(xvi)_

foregoing, _(xxviii)_ of  _Section 5.1_.

Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting and (II) ten (10)

(e) _Permitted Adverse Recommendation Changes and Permitted Termination to
Enter into a Superior Proposal_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, (x) an Acquisition Proposal is made

 



43  that did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.3_ (and has not been
withdrawn or abandoned), (y) the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (z) the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that
failure to take an action described in clause (i) or clause (ii) of this
_Section 5.3(e)_ would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, the Company Board may, in connection with such
Superior Proposal, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval:

(i) make an Adverse Recommendation Change; or

 

(ii) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section

Agreement that Parent proposes in response to such Superior Proposal; and

 

(iii) after complying with _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ of this _Section
5.3(f)_, determined that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal after giving due consideration to any changes proposed to be
made to this Agreement by Parent in a signed writing, and that the failure to
take an action set forth in  _Section 5.3(e)_ continues to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

_provided_ , _however_ , that if during the Notice Period any revisions are
made to the Superior Proposal that is the subject of such Notice of Superior
Proposal and such revisions are material (it being understood and agreed that
any change to consideration with respect to such proposal is material), the
Company shall deliver to Parent a new notice (" _Superior Proposal Change
Notice_ ") describing such material revisions (and providing copies of the
most recent draft of any agreements implementing such material revisions
proposed to be entered into between the Company and the Person making or
providing such Superior Proposal (or any Affiliate of such

 



44  Person)) and shall comply with the requirements of _clause (ii) _and
_clause (iii)_ of this _Section 5.3(f)_ with respect to such Superior
Proposal as so revised (substituting, for purposes of this proviso, the
longer of (x) the time remaining with respect to the original three (3)
Business Day Notice Period in respect of such Superior Proposal and (y) two
(2) Business Days following delivery by the Company of the Superior Proposal
Change Notice for the reference to "three (3) Business Days" in _Section

States federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including

Exchange Act or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act;  _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor the Company Board
(or any committee thereof) may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change except
in compliance with _Section 5.3(e)_ and _Section 5.3(f)_.

 

(h) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights under
the Company Support Agreement.

 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a confidentiality
agreement on terms that, taken as a whole, are not materially less
restrictive to the Companys counterparty thereto than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, it being understood that any such confidentiality
agreement need not contain a standstill provision or otherwise prohibit the
making, or amendment, of an Acquisition Proposal;

(ii) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or not
in writing), with respect to any (A) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
other business combination or similar transaction involving the Company, (B)
sale, lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly
(including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business
combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other
equity interests in a Subsidiary of the Company or otherwise) of any business
or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries representing fifteen
percent (15%) or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (C) issuance, sale or
other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any Person (or the stockholders
of any Person) or group of securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities)
representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting power of the
Company, (D) transaction in which the holders of the voting power of the
Company immediately prior to such transaction own ninety percent (90%) or less
of the voting power of the Company immediately following the transaction, (E)
transaction in which any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) shall
acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire
beneficial ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially owns or

more of the Shares or (F) any combination of the foregoing (in each case,
other than the Merger).

 



45 (iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ written offer made by a
third party or group pursuant to which such third party or group would
acquire, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of the Shares
or more than fifty percent (50%) of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on terms which the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation), taking into account all factors the Company
Board considers relevant, including the financial, regulatory, legal and
other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal (and any changes proposed by Parent
to the terms of this Agreement in a signed writing), is more favorable to
Company stockholders than the Merger from a financial point of view.

(j) Any action taken or not taken by any Representative of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries at the express or implied direction of the Company that
if taken or not taken by the Company would constitute a breach of this
_Section 5.3_ shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 

Section 5.4 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall prepare and, no later than July 30, 2015 or such other later date as
mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent in writing, file with the SEC a
proxy statement in preliminary form relating to the Company Stockholders
Meeting (the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Company will cause the
Proxy Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to stockholders of the
Company as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days) after (i) if the Company does not receive comments from the SEC
with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement and does not reasonably
believe that it will receive comments, the eleventh (11th) calendar day

any and all information regarding Parent and Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates as may be required to be disclosed therein as promptly as possible
after the date hereof. The Parties shall notify each other promptly of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the
SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all
correspondence between such or any of its representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement or the Merger. If the Company does receive comments from the
SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts (with the reasonable assistance of Parent) to promptly provide
responses to the SEC with respect to any comments received on the Proxy
Statement from the SEC and to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement.

 



46 (b) The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its respective
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing
to stockholders and at the time of the meeting of stockholders of the Company
to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If, at any time
prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, any event occurs with
respect to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or Merger Sub, or
any change occurs with respect to other information to be included in the
Proxy Statement, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement, or the Company or Parent should otherwise
discover any information relating to the Company or Parent (or any of their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers or shareholders) that is required
to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that
it would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the other party of such
event, change or discovery, and the Company shall promptly file, with Parents
cooperation, any necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement. The
Company will also advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof,
of any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the
Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
written comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall (i)
provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response and (ii) consider in good faith all reasonable comments proposed by
Parent.

(d) Unless there has occurred an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance
with _Section 5.3(e)_ (i) the Company shall, as soon as practicable following
the date of SEC Clearance of the Proxy Statement, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the holders of Shares (the " _Company
Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder
Approval, and (ii) the notice of such Company Stockholders Meeting shall state
that a resolution to adopt this Agreement will be considered at the Company
Stockholders Meeting. Unless the Company Board has effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 5.3(e)_, (x) the Company
Board shall include the Company Determination and the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (y) the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit the Company Stockholder Approval. The
Company shall not include in the Proxy Statement any proposal to vote upon or
consider any Acquisition Proposal (other than this Agreement and the Merger).
The Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting
without the prior written consent of Parent (other than for any such
postponements or adjournments (i) required by the SEC or the order of a court
of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) of not more than thirty (30) days in the
aggregate that are otherwise required by Law or that are due to the failure of
a quorum to be present on the date scheduled for such meeting). 

 



47 Section 5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, subject to applicable Law and upon reasonable prior notice
(and solely to the extent not unreasonably disruptive to the business,
employees or management of any Acquired Company), the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its Representatives to, afford to Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to
the Companys and its Subsidiaries officers, employees, properties, offices,
other facilities and books and records, and shall make available to Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Representatives all financial, operating and
other data and information as Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives shall reasonably request,  _provided_ that the foregoing
shall not require the Company or its Subsidiaries (i) to permit any access or
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of
the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties or (provided that the Company has used commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the consent of such third party) violate any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality owed to third parties, or (ii) to disclose any
privileged information of it or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) allow any
environmental testing or sampling. All requests for access or information made
pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ shall be directed to the executive officer or
other Person designated by the Company. All such information shall be governed
by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat and will cause its
Representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries made available to Parent or Merger
Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with the letter agreement between the Company and Parent
dated April 30, 2015 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") which
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms.

 

Section 5.6 _Further Action; Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will
cooperate with each other Party and use (and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the Merger
as soon as reasonably practicable. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, each Party hereto agrees (i) to make, if required, appropriate
filings under any Antitrust Law as promptly as reasonably practicable,
including an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to
the HSR Act, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly
as reasonably practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after
the date hereof and (ii) to reasonably promptly provide to each and every
federal, state, local or foreign court or Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable Antitrust Law (" _Government
Antitrust Entity_ ") all non-privileged information and documents
requested by any Government Antitrust Entity or that are necessary, proper or
advisable to permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company and Parent shall each request early termination of the
waiting period provided for in the HSR Act.

 



48 (b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section
5.6(a)_ to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) reasonably cooperate in
all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission to
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by a Governmental
Entity, (ii) keep the other Party reasonably informed of the status of any
notice, approval, investigation or inquiry under Antitrust Law, or any other
material investigation or other inquiry by a Governmental Entity, relating to
the completion of the Merger, including promptly forwarding to the other
Party any notices or any other communication received by any of such Persons
to it or its Subsidiary (or the Representatives of either of them) from, or
given by such Party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division
of the DOJ or any other U.S. or foreign Governmental Entity, in each case
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) permit the
other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
substantive written communication to be given to a Governmental Entity in
connection with the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and to have
its comments considered in good faith. Neither the Company nor Parent shall
permit any of its officers or any other Representatives to participate in any
meeting or substantive telephone discussion with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry with respect to the
Merger or other transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless to the
extent practicable (i) it consults with the other Party in advance and (ii) to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or substantive
telephone discussion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Parent
may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other side under this 
_Section 5.6(b)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of
the recipient dealing with Antitrust Law matters, and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or
consultants of the recipient or any of its Affiliates unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (the
Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Each of the
Company and Parent shall cause its respective counsel regarding Antitrust Law
to comply with this _Section 5.6(b)_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 5.6(b)_, materials provided to the other Party or
its counsel may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of
the Company and privileged communications.

 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, without
limiting the generality of the other undertakings pursuant to  _Section
5.6(a)_ and _Section 5.6(b)_, but subject to _Section 5.6(d)_, each of the
Company (in the case of _Section 5.6(c)(ii)_ set forth below) and Parent (in
all cases set forth below) agree to take or cause to be taken the following
actions:

(i) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of
any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree,
decision, determination or judgment under Antitrust Laws that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the defense through
litigation on the merits of any claim asserted in any court, agency or other
proceeding by any Person under Antitrust Laws, including any Governmental
Entity, seeking to delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of such transactions; and

 



49 (ii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take, in the event that
any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order,
judgment, determination or decree under Antitrust Laws is entered, issued or
enacted, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted,
in any proceeding, review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would delay, restrain, prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, any and all steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting
of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by this clause (ii) of
paragraph (c)) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend,
prevent, eliminate, avoid or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened
injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or enactment so
as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that
contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be obligated, in connection with any
Antitrust Law (including in connection with any Action arising thereunder) or
by any Government Antitrust Entity, to (i) proffer to, agree to or become
subject to any order, judgment or decree to, sell, license or dispose of or
hold separate, before or after the Closing, any assets, businesses, product
lines or interest in any assets or businesses of Parent or any of its
Affiliates or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to consent to any
sale, license, or disposition, or agreement to sell, license or dispose, by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, of any of their assets or businesses
or product lines, (ii) proffer to, agree to, or become subject to any order,
judgment or decree to make or accept, any changes, modifications, limitations
or restrictions in the operations of any assets or businesses of Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or (iii) proffer to or agree
to any new concession, accommodation or liability; _provided_ _that_ , Parent
shall be required to consent to the sale, license, disposition, holding
separate of, or an agreement to sell, license, dispose of or hold separate,
assets of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries or any changes,
modifications, limitations or restrictions in the operations of any assets or
businesses of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any
concession, accommodation or liability, solely with respect to the assets,
businesses or product lines (or interests therein), or operations, of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent or
its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)), to
the extent that (A) such sale, license, disposition, holding separate,
change, modification, limitation, restriction, concession, accommodation or
other matter or agreement to sell, license, dispose of, hold separate, modify,
limit, restrict, make a concession or accommodation or incur a liability, or
other matter, is required by a Government Antitrust Entity in order to obtain
any consent or approval referred to in _Section 6.1(b)_ and (B) such sale,
license, disposition, holding separate or agreement to sell, license, dispose
of, hold separate, change, modification, limitation, restriction, concession,
accommodation, liability or other matter (or agreement to do any of the
foregoing), taken together with all other such sales, licenses, dispositions,
holdings separate, changes, modifications, limitations, restrictions,
concessions, accommodations, liabilities or other matters (and agreements to
do any of the foregoing) Parent and its Subsidiaries have agreed or become
subject to pursuant to this proviso, would not materially diminish the value
of the Acquired

 



50  Companies taken as a whole. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall proffer to, agree to or become subject to any of the items set forth in
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence without the prior
written consent of Parent, and none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to agree to any of the items set forth in clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii) of the preceding sentence (or contemplated by the proviso thereof)
that is not conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman
Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended and all other Laws that are designed or intended to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition through
merger or acquisition.

(f) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not negotiate, effect or agree to any
business combination (whether structured as a merger, tender offer, exchange
offer or otherwise), or the acquisition of any assets, licenses, rights,
product lines, operations or businesses of any person, that would, or would
reasonably be expected to, prevent or materially delay or impair the
consummation of the Merger for or due to Antitrust Law-related reasons.

 

(g) In the event that Parent notifies the Company at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Effective Time that Parent has determined to repay,
effective at or after the Effective Time, all amounts outstanding under (i)
both (A) the Credit Agreement, dated as of December 17, 2010, among the
Company, the other borrowers thereto, Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC,

lenders party thereto, as amended by the First Amendment to Credit Agreement,
dated as of March 5, 2013, and further amended by the Second Amendment to
Credit Agreement, dated as of December 31, 2014 (as amended, modified or
supplemented, the " _Revolving Credit Facility_ "); and (B) the Second Amended
and Restated Term B Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of December 31,
2014, among the Company, Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
and Smith, Incorporated, UBS Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC,
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (as amended,
modified or supplemented, the " _Term Loan Facility_ ") or (ii) any other
Credit Agreement, the Company shall, at Parents request, and sole cost, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain customary payoff letters and
instruments of discharge to be delivered at, and effective at, the Effective
Time, providing for the payoff, discharge and termination in full of all
obligations under, and the release of all Liens and pledges of collateral
securing obligations made in connection with, the Revolving Credit Facility
and the Term Loan Facility or such other Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.6_, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their Representatives, (i) shall be obligated
to pay, repay, prepay or otherwise retire any amounts outstanding under (or
otherwise make any payment in connection with) the Revolving Credit Facility
or the Term Loan Facility or such other Credit Agreement unless (x) the
Company has received from Parent funds to pay in full the payoff amount for
the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility and (as applicable)
such other Credit Agreement and any fees or other amounts payable to the
lenders or their agents thereunder in connection with the matters
contemplated by this _Section 5.6(g)_ and (y) to the extent required by the
lenders or their agents under the Revolving Credit Facility (or such other
Credit Agreement) pursuant to the terms thereof, Parent has agreed to and has
provided backstop letters of credit or cash collateralized any existing
letters of credit and

 



51  guarantees and hedging arrangements and other bank products thereunder in a
manner satisfactory to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility (or
such other applicable Credit Agreement), to the extent applicable, or (ii)
(without limiting clause (i)) shall be required to enter into any definitive
agreement or have any liability or obligation under any certificate, document,
instrument, credit agreement or any related document or any other agreement
or document related to the retirement, payment, repayment or prepayment of
amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan
Facility or any other Credit Agreement, in each case that is not contingent
upon the Effective Time having occurred. Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against any damages, losses, costs, or expenses (including attorneys
fees) incurred by any of them as a result of or in connection with their
performance under this _Section 5.6(g)_.

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require
Parent, the Company or Merger Sub to, and the Company shall not without the
prior written consent of Parent, proffer or agree to any concession or
additional liability with any Contract counterparty or any of its Affiliates
in order to obtain any consent sought under any Contract.

Section 5.7 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries at
the Effective Time who continues to remain employed by Parent or a Subsidiary
thereof following the Closing Date (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") shall, during
the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2016,
be provided with (i) base salary or base wage, target annual cash incentive
compensation and employee benefits (excluding long-term incentive compensation
opportunities and post-termination welfare benefits) which, in the aggregate
are no less favorable than the base salary or base wage, target annual cash
incentive compensation and employee benefits (but excluding long-term
incentive compensation opportunities and post-termination welfare benefits)
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to each such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) severance benefits that are
no less favorable than the severance benefits provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are set forth on Section 5.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter
with respect to the Continuing Employees subject thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the requirements of this _Section 5.7(a)_ shall not apply to
Continuing Employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

(b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall give each Continuing Employee
full credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries to the
extent such service would be recognized if it had been performed as an
employee of Parent for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of
benefit levels under any Parent Employee Plans or policy of general
application relating to vacation or severance, except for benefit accrual
purposes under any defined benefit plan of Parent, for purposes of determining
eligibility for retiree and other post-termination health and welfare
benefits or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits. For
the avoidance of doubt, no Continuing Employee shall be retroactively eligible
for any Parent Employee Plan, including any such Parent Employee Plan that
was frozen prior to the Effective Time. In addition, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to any Continuing Employee
under any

 



52  Parent Employee Plan to the extent they were inapplicable to, or satisfied
under, the Company Plan in which any such employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) give each Continuing Employee credit for
the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable
deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred
prior to the Effective Time for which payment has been made. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Parent Employee Plan_ " means any "employee
pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), "employee welfare
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any other formal
written plan or policy under which service with Parent is relevant to
eligibility, vesting and/or level of benefits, for the benefit of, or relating
to, the current employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries and with respect to
which eligibility has not been frozen.

(c) The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or
appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date: (a) any Company Plan that contains a cash or
deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code
(the " _Company 401(k) Plans_ "); and (b) any Company Plan set forth on
Section 5.7(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, unless Parent, in its sole
and absolute discretion, agrees to sponsor and maintain any such Company Plans
by providing the Company with written notice of such election at least five
(5) days before the Effective Time. Unless Parent so provides notice to the
Company, the Company shall deliver to Parent, prior to the Closing Date,
evidence that the Company Board has validly adopted resolutions to terminate
such Company Plans (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be
subject to review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), effective no later than the
date immediately preceding the Closing Date.

(d) If Parent maintains a defined contribution plan that includes a qualified
cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code
(the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") and Parent elects to have the Company and
Affiliates, as applicable, terminate the Company 401(k) Plans pursuant to
_Section 5.7(c)_, Parent shall permit each Continuing Employee participating
in the Company 401(k) Plans to elect, and Parent agrees to cause the Parent
401(k) Plan to accept, in accordance with applicable Law and the terms of the
Parent 401(k) Plan and, subject to Parents determination, in its sole
discretion, that the applicable Company 401(k) Plan meets the requirements of
Section 401, _et. seq._ of the Code, a "direct rollover" (within the meaning
of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of his or her account balances (including
earnings thereon through the date of transfer and, to the extent practicable
with the use of commercially reasonable efforts, promissory notes evidencing
all outstanding loans) under the Company 401(k) Plans. Each Continuing
Employee shall become a participant in the Parent 401(k) Plan on the Closing
Date (giving effect to the service crediting provisions of _Section 5.7(b)_);
it being agreed that no Continuing Employee shall experience a gap in
eligibility to participate in a tax-qualified defined contribution plan as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor in
accordance with their respective terms all employee benefit obligations to
current and former employees under each Company Plan set forth on Section
5.7(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(f) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to

 



53  continue any specific employee benefit plans or to continue the employment
of any specific person. The provisions of this _Section 5.7_ are for the sole
benefit of the Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended
or shall be construed to (i) constitute an amendment to any of the
compensation and benefits plans (including the Company Plans and the Parent
Employee Plans) maintained for or provided to Continuing Employees prior to
or following the Effective Time, (ii) impede or limit Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from, following the Effective
Time, amending or terminating any Company Plan in accordance with its terms
or (iii) confer upon or give to any person (including for the avoidance of
doubt any current or former employees, directors, or independent contractors
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the Parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided
for in this _Section 5.7_) under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement.

Section 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent shall
promptly notify each other of the receipt of any written communication
received from any Person alleging that a material consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.9 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director or employee may
have under the Company Constituent Documents, any agreement or Company Plan,
from and after the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law (and Parent shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, subject to the
immediately following sentence), each present and each former officer or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and each Person who may
become an officer or director of the Company or a Company Subsidiary between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time) (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such
Indemnified Partys service as a director, officer or employee of the Company
or its Subsidiaries or services performed by such persons at the request of
the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including (i)
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
actions to enforce this  _Section 5.9_ or any other indemnification or
advancement right of any Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein (but subject to any superior rights contained in the Company
Constituent Documents (or, as relevant, those of the applicable Subsidiary of
the Company) or applicable indemnification agreements to which any Acquired
Company is a party), prior to making any advance in respect of the
indemnification obligations set forth in this  _Section 5.9_, the Person who
is requesting such advance shall agree to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification in
respect of the matter for which such advance was made.

 



54 (b) Except as may be required by applicable Law, Parent and the Company agree
that for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as
provided in the Company Constituent Documents (or, as relevant, the
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary) or in any indemnification
agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect,
and for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i) the
directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies, and (ii) the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time
from one or more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as
the Companys insurance carrier as of the date hereof with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as the
Companys existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error,
misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or
any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Company expend, nor shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend, for such policies pursuant to
this sentence an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently
paid by the Company as of the date hereof for such insurance as set forth on
Section 5.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter. If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policy as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for
a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions
and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds
as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such
six (6)-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such
policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300%
of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company as of the date hereof for
such insurance as set forth on Section 5.9(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage reasonably available for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

 



55 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) with respect to which an
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification is instituted against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, then the provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall continue in effect

70 Section 8.9 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties irrevocably
agrees that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby brought by any other Party or
its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in the Delaware
Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or
federal court within the State of Delaware), and each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally and
unconditionally, with regard to the action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each
of the Parties agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating
to this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby in any court other
than the courts of the State of Delaware, as described above, other than
actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree
or award rendered by such court. Each of the Parties further agrees that
notice provided in accordance with  _Section 8.2_ or in such other manner as
may be permitted by Law shall constitute sufficient service of process and the
Parties further waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of
the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware, as
described above, for any reason, (b) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise) and (c) that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit,
action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

Party without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Merger Sub may assign in its sole discretion and
without the consent of any other Party, any or all (but not less than all) of
its rights and interests, and delegate all but not less than all of its
and obligations, under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent that is a Delaware corporation by providing written
notice thereof to the Company; provided that (i) any such assignment shall not
prevent, materially delay or impede the consummation of the Merger or
otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company
under this Agreement and (ii) no such assignment shall relieve Parent or
Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder and (iii) such assignment shall not

entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement without proof of actual
damages. Each of the Parties hereby waives any requirement under any law to
post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. In the event
that any action is brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement, no Party shall allege, and each Party hereby waives the defense or
counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted
therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the
intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application of such
provision, in any other jurisdiction.

 

Section 8.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE

Sub and the Company acknowledges that each Party to this Agreement has been
represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or any
legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities
in this Agreement against the drafting Party has no application and is hereby
expressly waived.

intended to constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting,
representations or warranties of the Company, except and solely to the extent
that a representation or warranty set forth in Article III of this Agreement
specifically states that a true, complete or accurate list of a particular
item is

 



72  set forth on a particular section of the Company Disclosure Letter. The fact
that any item or other information is disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Letter shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be
disclosed by this Agreement. Inclusion of any item or other matter in the
Company Disclosure Letter shall not be construed as an admission or indication
that such item or other matter is or is not material or that such item has
had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Headings in the Company Disclosure Letter are inserted for reference purposes
and for convenience of the reader only, and shall not affect the

AMENDED AND RESTATED

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

OF

REMY INTERNATIONAL, INC.

FIRST: The name of the corporation (which is hereinafter referred to as the
"Corporation") is Remy International, Inc.

SECOND: The address of the Corporations registered office in the State of
Delaware is The Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington,
Delaware 19801, New Castle County. The name of the Corporations registered
agent at such address is The Corporation Trust Company.

 

THIRD: The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the
General Corporation Law of Delaware (the "DGCL").

FOURTH: The capital stock of the Corporation shall consist of 2,000 shares of
Common Stock with a par value of $0.01 per share, of which, 1,000 shares
shall be Class A Common Stock and 1,000 shares shall be Class B Common Stock.
Each share of Common Stock of the Corporation shall entitle the holder thereof
to one vote, in person or by proxy, on each proposition submitted to the
stockholders for their vote thereon or their written consent thereto.

FIFTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by
statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or
repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation, subject to any specific limitation on
such power contained in any Bylaws adopted by the stockholders. Elections of
directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the Corporation
so provide.

SIXTH: No person who is or was a director of the Corporation shall be
personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such
exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted by the DGCL
as the same exists or hereafter may be amended. If the DGCL is hereafter
amended to authorize corporate action further limiting or eliminating the
liability of directors, then the liability of a director to the Corporation
or its stockholders shall be limited or eliminated to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or amendment of this Section
Six of the Certificate of Incorporation by the stockholders of
the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision
of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Section Six will,
unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent
such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to further limit or
eliminate the liability of directors) and shall not adversely affect any right
or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such
repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision with respect
to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption
of such inconsistent provision. SEVENTH: Each person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a
party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), including, without limitation,
proceedings by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in
its favor, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation,
is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee
benefit plan (hereinafter a "Covered Person"), whether the basis of such
proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer,
employee or agent, or in any other capacity while serving as a director,
officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Corporation to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law,
as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability
and loss (including, without limitation, attorneys fees, judgments, fines,
ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably
incurred or suffered by such Covered Person in connection with such
proceeding, and such right to indemnification shall continue as to a person
who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure
to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided,
however, that, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification,
the Corporation shall indemnify a Covered Person in connection with
a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Covered Person only if such
proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors. The
right to indemnification conferred by this Section Seven shall be a contract
right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses
incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any such proceeding in
advance of its final disposition. The rights conferred on any Covered Person
by this Section Seven shall not be exclusive of any other rights which any
Covered Person may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Certificate of
Incorporation, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors, or otherwise. Any repeal or amendment of this Section Seven by the
stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any
other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this
Section Seven, will, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only
(except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation
to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than
permitted prior thereto), and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect
any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or
adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any act or omission
occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent
provision. This Section Seven shall not limit the right of the Corporation,
to the extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify
and to advance expenses to persons other than Covered Persons.

 

EIGHTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner
now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon the
stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.
