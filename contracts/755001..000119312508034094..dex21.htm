STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (hereinafter called this " _Agreement_ "), dated as
of February 15, 2008, by and among NiSource Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Seller Parent_ "), Bay State Gas Company, a Massachusetts corporation ("
_Seller_ " and together with Seller Parent, the " _Sellers_ ")), and Unitil
Corporation, a New Hampshire corporation, (" _Purchaser_ "). Seller Parent,
Seller and Purchaser are sometimes referred to herein individually as a "
_Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_ ".

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Seller is the owner of all of the outstanding shares of common
stock, $10 par value (the " _N Company Shares_ ") of Northern Utilities, Inc.,
a New Hampshire corporation (the " _N Company_ "), and Seller Parent is the
owner of all of the outstanding shares of common stock, $1.00 par value (the
" _G Company Shares_ " and together with the N Company Shares the " _Company
Shares_ ") of Granite State Gas Transmission, Inc., a New Hampshire
corporation (the " _G Company_ " and together with the N Company, the "
_Companies_ "); and

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the
Sellers desire to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser desires to purchase from
the Sellers, the Company Shares.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

PURCHASE AND SALE

Section 1.1 _Purchase and Sale_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, as provided in _Section 1.3_,
(a) Seller shall sell, assign, transfer and deliver to Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall purchase from Seller, the N Company Shares, and (b) Seller
Parent shall sell, assign, transfer and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser
shall purchase from Seller Parent, the G Company Shares

Section 1.2 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for the Company
Shares shall be one hundred and sixty million dollars ($160,000,000) (the "
_Initial Purchase Price_ "), subject to adjustment as provided in _Sections
1.4_ and _1.5_ (the Initial Purchase Price, as so adjusted, being the "
_Purchase Price_ "), and shall be payable as set forth in _Sections 1.4_ and
_1.5_ , net of any Income Taxes that the Purchaser is required to withhold
pursuant to applicable Law.

Section 1.3 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place (i) at the offices of Schiff
Hardin LLP, 6600 Sears Tower, Chicago, Illinois on the fifth Business Day
after the last of the conditions set forth in  _Article VI_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) at such other place and
time and/or on such other date as Seller and Purchaser may agree in writing
(the " _Closing Date_ "). As used in this Agreement, the term " _Business Day_
" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which banks in
New York City are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. Section 1.4 _Closing Deliveries_. At or prior to the Closing,

(a) Purchaser shall (i) pay to Seller an amount equal to the Initial Purchase
Price, plus the Estimated Net Working Capital, if the Estimated Net Working
Capital is a positive number, or minus the Estimated Net Working Capital, if
the Estimated Net Working Capital is a negative number, which amount shall be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated
by Seller on or before the second Business Day prior to the Closing Date, and
(ii) deliver to the Sellers the documents, instruments and writings specified
in _Article VI_ hereof and such other documents, instruments and writings as
may be reasonably requested by the Sellers at or prior to the Closing
pursuant to this Agreement; and

(b) the Sellers shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser the
documents, instruments and writings specified in _Article VI_ hereof and such
other documents, instruments and writings as may be reasonably requested by
Purchaser at or prior to the Closing pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 1.5 _Net Working Capital_.

(a) _Adjustment to Purchase Price_.

(i) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

(A) " _Accounting Principles_ " means generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States as promulgated from time to time, applied on a
basis consistent with past practices, except as otherwise provided for in
_Exhibit A_.

(B) " _Closing Net Working Capital_ " means the Net Working Capital as of the
close of business on the Closing Date. 

(C) " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ " means the estimate by Seller of the
Net Working Capital, as prepared by Seller pursuant to _Section
1.5(a)(ii)(A)_ and set forth in the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement.

(D) " _Net Working Capital_ " means (1) the sum of the total current assets
of the Companies (including cash and marketable securities, and excluding all
Income Tax refunds, any assets relating to any Income Tax benefit expected to
be obtained from the use of Income Tax attributes of the Companies and any
amounts that are paid by the Companies on the Closing Date pursuant to a Tax
sharing agreement prior to the termination of such agreement at the Closing)
as of the applicable date _minus_ (2) the sum of the total current
liabilities of the Companies (excluding deferred Income Tax liabilities and
any Income Tax liabilities) as of the applicable date, in each case,
calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles.

(E) " _Net Working Capital Adjustment_ " means the amount by which the Closing
Net Working Capital is greater than or less than, as the case may be, the
Estimated Net Working Capital. For the avoidance of doubt, the Net Working
Capital Adjustment shall be positive if the Closing Net Working Capital is
greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital and negative if it is less
than the Estimated Net Working Capital.



 

2 (ii) _Preparation of the Preliminary Statement_.

(A) Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, no more than ten days prior
to the expected Closing Date, a certificate executed by Seller setting forth
in reasonable detail Sellers calculation, and the amount, of the Estimated
Net Working Capital as of the last day of the month immediately preceding the
Closing Date, _provided that_ , if the expected Closing Date is within the
first ten days of any given month, the Estimated Net Working Capital will be
calculated as of the last day of the second month preceding the Closing Date
(the " _Estimated Net Working Capital Statement_ "). The Estimated
Net Working Capital included in the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement
shall be calculated in accordance with _Section 1.5(a)(i)(D)_ and with the
Accounting Principles. The Estimated Net Working Capital Statement shall
include a detailed listing of the items and amounts included in the
calculation of the Estimated Net Working Capital, and shall be prepared by
Seller in good faith and in accordance with this Agreement and the books and
records of the Companies, and shall include a certification that it was
prepared in accordance with this _Section 1.5(a)(ii)_, and that the Estimated
Net Working Capital included therein was calculated in accordance with the
Accounting Principles.

(B) Within 50 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser will prepare and deliver
to Seller a preliminary statement (the " _Preliminary Statement_ ") setting
forth in reasonable detail Purchasers calculation of the Net Working Capital
Adjustment, which shall include a detailed listing of the items and amounts of
the Closing Net Working Capital included in the calculation of the Net
Working Capital Adjustment. The Closing Net Working Capital shall be
calculated in accordance with _Section 1.5(a)(i)(D)_ and the Accounting
Principles. The Preliminary Statement shall be prepared by Purchaser in good
faith and in accordance with this Agreement and the books and records of the
Companies, and shall be accompanied by a certificate of an officer of
Purchaser stating that the Preliminary Statement was prepared in accordance
with this  _Section 1.5(a)(ii)_, and that the Closing Net Working Capital
included therein was calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles.
The Preliminary Statement as finally modified pursuant to clauses (iii)
through (v) of this _Section 1.5(a)_ to become the final statement of the
Net Working Capital Adjustment is referred to herein as the " _Final
Statement_ ". All disputes with respect to the Preliminary Statement and the
Final Statement will be resolved in accordance with clauses (iii) through (v)
of this _Section 1.5(a)_. In the event of a conflict between any calculation
of the Closing Net Working Capital in accordance with the books and records of
the Companies and a calculation of the Net Working Capital in accordance with
the Accounting Principles, the Accounting Principles shall control.

(iii) _Review of Preliminary Statement_.

(A) Seller will have 50 days following Purchasers delivery of the
Preliminary Statement to Seller to review and respond to the Preliminary
Statement, during which period Purchaser will grant Seller and its
accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") reasonable access during normal business hours to the
books and records of the Companies, Purchasers personnel, the employees of
the Companies and the work papers prepared by Purchasers independent
accountants (subject to compliance with Purchasers independent accountants
customer procedures for release) with respect to the Preliminary Statement.



 

3 (B) Unless Seller has delivered to Purchaser a written letter of its
disagreement with the Preliminary Statement (the " _Notice of Disagreement_
") on or prior to the 50th day following Purchasers delivery of the
Preliminary Statement to Seller, the Preliminary Statement will become the
Final Statement on the 51st day following Purchasers delivery of the
Preliminary Statement to Seller. The Notice of Disagreement, if any, shall set
forth in reasonable detail each proposed adjustment to the Preliminary
Statement and the basis for such adjustment. 

(C) If the Notice of Disagreement is delivered in accordance with _Section
1.5(a)(iii)(B)_, then: (1) any amount set forth in the Preliminary Statement
as to which Seller has not objected in the Notice of Disagreement in
accordance with _Section 1.5(a)(iii)(B)_ will be deemed to be accepted and
will become part of the Final Statement; and (2) the Preliminary Statement
shall become the Final Statement on the earlier of (x) the date that Seller
and Purchaser resolve in writing all remaining disputed matters specified in
the Notice of Disagreement or (y) the date that the Arbitrator delivers to
Seller and Purchaser a copy of the Final Statement and the Net Working Capital
Adjustment pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)(v)(D)_.

(iv) _Meeting to Resolve Proposed Adjustments_. As soon as reasonably
practicable, but in no event later than 10 days, after Sellers delivery of
the Notice of Disagreement, Purchaser and Seller will meet and endeavor to
resolve the unaccepted adjustments in the Notice of Disagreement. If Purchaser
and Seller reach agreement in writing on such adjustments, the
Final Statement will be the Preliminary Statement modified to reflect the
adjustments accepted pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)(iii)(C)(1)_ and those
otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties pursuant to this _Section
1.5(a)(iv)_. 

(v) _Resolution by Arbitration_.

(A) If Purchaser and Seller do not resolve to their mutual satisfaction all
disputed adjustments in the Notice of Disagreement within 15 days following
the meeting provided for in _Section 1.5(a)(iv)_, any remaining disputed
adjustments that were included in the Notice of Disagreement will be brought
before Pricewaterhouse Coopers (or, if such accounting firm shall decline to
act or is not, at the time of submission thereto, independent of Purchaser,
Seller or the Companies, to another independent accounting firm of national
reputation mutually acceptable to and independent of Purchaser and Seller)
(either Pricewaterhouse Coopers or such other accounting firm being the "
_Arbitrator_ ") for resolution in accordance with the following provisions of
this _Section 1.5(a)(v)_. None of Purchaser, Seller or the Companies (1)
has, in the three-year period prior to the date of this Agreement, engaged
the Arbitrator to perform any services in excess of $100,000 in any 12-month
period for any such Person, or (2) will engage the Arbitrator to perform any
service for such Person prior to the finalization of the Final Statement
pursuant to this _Section 1.5(a)_.

(B) On or prior to the 20th day following the meeting provided for in
_Section 1.5(a)(iv)_, Purchaser will furnish the Arbitrator with a copy of
this  



 

4  Agreement, the Preliminary Statement, the Notice of Disagreement and any
other relevant correspondence between the Parties. Purchaser and Seller will
also give the Arbitrator: (1) position papers outlining such Partys
respective arguments and supporting documentation for such Partys position;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchasers positions, arguments and
computations must be consistent in all material respects with those set forth
in the Preliminary Statement or agreed to with Seller pursuant to _Section
1.5(a)(iv)_ above (and the Arbitrator will not consider any that are
inconsistent), and Sellers positions, arguments and computations must be
consistent in all material respect with those set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement or agreed to with Purchaser pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)(iv)_
above (and the Arbitrator will not consider any that are inconsistent); and
(2) access to the books and records of the Companies, including any work
papers or other schedules prepared by such Partys accountants (subject to
compliance with such Partys accountants customary procedures for release)
relating to the preparation of the Preliminary Statement and the Notice of
Disagreement.

(C) The Arbitrators engagement will be limited to (1) reviewing the
Preliminary Statement and the amounts placed in dispute by the Notice of
Disagreement pursuant to Section _1.5(a)(iii)(B)_ ; (2) determining (x)
whether Purchasers proposed amount for each individual item in the
Preliminary Statement or Sellers proposed adjustment thereto in the Notice of
Disagreement is calculated more nearly in accordance with  _Section
1.5(a)(ii)_, and (y) whether there were mathematical errors in the Preliminary
Statement; (3) preparing the Final Statement, which will include (x) those
amounts in the Preliminary Statement accepted by Seller pursuant to _Section
1.5(a)(iii)(C)(1)_, (y) those adjustments otherwise agreed to in writing by
Purchaser and Seller pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)(iv)_ and (z) those amounts
determined by the Arbitrator to be calculated more nearly in accordance with
_Section 1.5(a)(ii)_; and (4) calculating the Net Working Capital Adjustment.
The fees and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be borne by Purchaser and Seller
in inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the
Arbitrator, which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the
Arbitrator at the time the determination of the Arbitrator is rendered on the
Final Statement and the Net Working Capital Adjustment.

(D) The Parties will instruct the Arbitrator to (1) complete its preparation
of the Final Statement and the Net Working Capital Adjustment within 20 days
from the date of submission of the disputed adjustments to the Arbitrator
pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)(v)(B)_, and (2) deliver promptly thereafter a
copy of the Final Statement and the Net Working Capital Adjustment to
Purchaser and Seller together with a report setting forth each disputed
adjustment and the Arbitrators determination with respect thereto. The
Arbitrators determination will be conclusive and binding upon the Parties
and may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(vi) _Payment of Adjustments_.

(A) If the Net Working Capital Adjustment finally determined in accordance
with this _Section 1.5(a)_ is positive, Purchaser will deliver to Seller
within five Business Days following the date on which the Preliminary
Statement becomes the Final Statement (as determined in accordance with this
_Section_  



 

5   _1.5(a)_ ) an amount of cash equal to the excess of the Closing Net Working
Capital over the Estimated Net Working Capital, in immediately
available funds by wire transfer pursuant to instructions provided in writing
by Seller.

(B) If the Net Working Capital Adjustment finally determined in accordance
with this _Section 1.5(a)_ is negative, Seller will deliver to Purchaser
within five Business Days following the date on which the Preliminary
Statement becomes the Final Statement (as determined in accordance with this
_Section 1.5(a)_) an amount of cash equal to the excess of the Estimated Net
Working Capital over the Closing Net Working Capital, in immediately available
funds by wire transfer pursuant to instructions provided in writing by
Purchaser.

(C) All payments made pursuant to this _Section 1.5(a)(vi)_ shall be made
with interest from the Closing Date calculated at the U.S. Prime Rate as
published in the "Money Rates" section of The Wall Street Journal on the
Closing Date.

For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Agreement, a smaller negative
integer ( _i.e._ , closer to zero) is always "greater than" a larger negative
integer ( _i.e._ , further from zero). For example, -2 is greater than -10.

(b) _No Right of Offset_. Except as expressly provided above in this _Section
1.5_, no Party may offset any amounts due to any other Party under this
_Section 1.5_ against any amounts due to such first Party under this
Agreement.

their obligations under, this Agreement, excluding any such change, effect,
event or occurrence resulting from (A) general economic, financial,
regulatory, meteorological or market conditions, (B) conditions or

for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities
of such Company, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are

any matter.

(c) Neither Company owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock,
partnership, membership, joint venture or other ownership or equity interest

authorizations and/or notices referred to in _Section 2.4(a)_, the Sellers
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of

trust agreement or other funding instrument; (B) the most recent determination
letter received from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ "); (C) all

(c) Except for those matters that would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, each Benefit Plan, has been operated and administered in all respects
in compliance with its terms and all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and to the
knowledge of the Sellers, there are no pending or threatened claims with
respect to any Benefit Plan except for ordinary and usual claims for benefits
by participants and beneficiaries.

(d) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by either Seller or
any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full when due, and no
condition exists that presents a material risk to either Seller or any ERISA
Affiliate of incurring a liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any
Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA (collectively, the " _Seller
Pension Plans_ "). None of the Seller Pension Plans which are subject to the
minimum funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA, nor any trust established thereunder, have incurred any "accumulated
funding deficiency" (or "liquidity shortfall" (as those terms are defined in
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived. Full

Seller Pension Plans ended on or before the date of this Agreement and all
periods thereafter prior to the Closing Date. Except as disclosed on 
_Section 2.8(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, neither of the Sellers
nor any other Person that, together with Sellers or any of their Affiliates,
is or was treated as a single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o)

plan or arrangement that is a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section
3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. The Companies will have no liability with
respect to any multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) or
4001(a)(3) of ERISA as of the Closing Date).

(e) Each Benefit Plan, that is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning
of Section 401(a) of the Code has been the subject of a favorable
determination letter from the IRS to the effect that such Benefit Plan is
qualified and exempt from federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and
501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such determination letter has been

Section 502(i) of ERISA. Neither of the Sellers nor either Company has
incurred or reasonably expects to incur a tax or penalty imposed by Section
4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA with respect to any Company
Employees. Until the Closing Date, Seller shall continue to operate and fund
the Seller Pension Plans in such a manner to ensure that the Adjusted Funding
Target Attainment Percentage (as defined in the Pension Protection Act of
2006 (the " _PPA_ ")) of each Seller Pension Plan does not cause the benefits
under such plan to become restricted or limited under the provisions of the
PPA.

(g) Except as provided in _Section 4.5(c)_ of this Agreement, neither the
execution of this Agreement nor the approval or consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional or subsequent event) shall result in any payment,
acceleration, vesting or increase in compensation or benefits under any
Benefit Plans.

 

(h) The Benefit Plans that are maintained or sponsored by the Companies, if
any, may be amended or terminated. Except as disclosed in  _Section 2.8(h)_
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, other than pursuant to any applicable
collective bargaining agreements, no written oral representations have been
made to any Company Employee promising or guaranteeing any employer payment
or funding for the continuation of medical, dental, life or disability
coverage for any period of time beyond the end of the current plan year
(except pursuant to Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B
of the Code). No written or oral representations have been made to any
Company Employee concerning the employee benefits of Purchaser or its
Affiliates.

(i) Each Benefit Plan, as it relates to Company Employees, which is subject to
Section 409A of the Code, has been operated in good faith compliance with
Section 409A of the Code in all material respects.

Section 2.9 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. Each Company is conducting its
business in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws.
Each Company has all permits, approvals, authorizations, licenses or other
registrations necessary to conduct its business as presently conducted, except
for those the absence of which, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect
(collectively, " _Permits_ "). All such Permits are in full force and effect
in all material respects and neither of the Sellers nor either Company has
received any written notice of any suspension, modification, revocation,
cancellation or non-renewal, in whole or in part, of any such Permit. Assuming
receipt of all Required Statutory Approvals constituting a condition to
closing but without considering for purposes of this representation and
warranty any restrictions or other terms imposed as a condition to receipt of
such Required Statutory Approvals, the entry into this Agreement and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not adversely
affect the rights of either Company under such Permits, except for any such
adverse effects that individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. This _Section 2.9_ does
not relate to Employee Benefit Plans, which are the subject solely of _Section
2.8_, environmental matters, which are the subject solely of _Section 2.10_,
Taxes, which are the subject solely of _Section 2.11_, or labor and
employment matters, which are the subject solely of _Section 2.12_.

Effect, (i) each Company is in compliance with all applicable Environmental
Laws; (ii) (A) each Company has timely applied for and has obtained all

to the knowledge of the Sellers, any investigations pursuant to Environmental

Environmental Law for any Hazardous Substance disposal at, or release to, any
third party property; (viii) neither Company is subject to any order, decree,
injunction or other arrangement with any Governmental Entity or any agreement

Intellectual Property Rights constitute all of the intellectual property
necessary to operate the Companies businesses as presently conducted.

(b) Except for such matters that would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) the use of the Intellectual Property
Rights by the Companies do not infringe upon, violate or interfere with or

Person.

Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) to the knowledge of the Sellers, no

when appropriate and (ii) the security, confidentiality and integrity of all

information, that in the reasonable judgment of either Seller would materially
disrupt normal business operations or would result in the disclosure of any
trade secrets of third parties or materially violate any of its obligations
with respect to confidentiality. All requests for information made pursuant

relating to or connected with or arising out of this Agreement or the matters
contained herein, without obtaining the prior approval of the other
Party, except as may be required by Law, exchange or trading market or inter-
dealer quotation system in which case, the Party proposing to issue such press
release or make such public statement will use commercially reasonable efforts
to consult in good faith with the other Party before issuing such press
release or making such public statement. The requirements of this _Section
4.4_ will be in addition to those included in the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 4.5 _Employee Matters_.

(a) _Company Employees_.

(i) At least one month prior to the Closing, Seller will deliver to Purchaser
a true and correct list (the " _Employee List_ ") of all active employees of
each Company, including all such employees absent due to vacation, holiday,
sickness, short-term disability or other approved leave or absence who are
expected to return to work within three months of the date of this Agreement
(the " _Company Employees_ "). Seller shall update the list at least two
Business Days prior to Closing to reflect any changes prior to the Closing
Date.

(ii) For 12 months following the Closing Date, neither Company will reduce the
salary or base hourly wage rate of any Company Employee below the rate in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(iii) If during the 12-month period following the Closing Date, either
Company terminates the employment of any Company Employee, Purchaser will
provide or cause to be provided to such Company Employee severance benefits no
less favorable than the severance benefits that would have been provided, if
any, to the Company Employee upon such termination under any severance plan
in which the Company Employee was eligible to participate in effect on the
date hereof (or, if applicable, pursuant to the collective bargaining
agreement covering the Company Employee).

(b) _Benefit Plans Generally_.

(i) As of the Closing Date, each Company will cease to participate in each
Benefit Plan, and the Sellers and their Affiliates will take such action as
is necessary to formally cease such participation in each Benefit Plan. Except
as otherwise provided herein, after the Closing Date, each Seller, as
applicable, will retain all liabilities for claims under such Benefit Plans,
whether such claims are made before, on or after the Closing Date. Without
limiting the foregoing and for avoidance of doubt, the Sellers or their
Affiliates (other than the Companies) will retain all obligations and
liabilities relating to benefits (including pension and retiree medical
benefits), if any, provided or to be provided to all present and former
employees, consultants or directors of the Companies who are not Company
Employees.

(ii) For 12 months following the Closing Date, Purchaser will, or will cause
the Companies or one of their Affiliates to provide employee benefits to
Company Employees under employee benefit plans maintained by Purchaser, the
Companies or their Affiliates (collectively, the " _Purchaser Plans_ "), which
benefits will be substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided
to Company Employees under the Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing
Date. For avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall not be required to establish a
cash balance pension plan.



 

26 (iii) To the extent service is relevant for purposes of (A) eligibility, (B)
vesting, (C) benefit accruals, but only to the extent that the future accruals
are determined by a schedule that provides different accruals for different
service levels (without duplicating previously accrued benefits), and (D)
calculation of the amount of any vacation, sick days and severance benefits,
Purchaser will, or will cause the applicable Company or one of its Affiliates
to, credit such Company Employees for service earned on and prior to the
Closing Date with the applicable Seller, that Company or their Affiliates
(and any predecessors) in addition to service earned with Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates after the Closing Date, but not to the extent such (x) credit
would result in a duplication of benefits or (y) period of service is not
recognized under the Purchaser Plan with respect to employees of Purchaser and
its Affiliates covered by such plan, program or arrangement. For avoidance of
doubt, Purchaser shall not provide credit for service on and prior to the
Closing Date for purposes of calculating the Companys Employees benefits
under Purchasers pension plans, except to the extent required by _Section
4.5(e)(ii)(A)(1)_. Purchaser will, or will cause each Company to, permit
Company Employees (and their eligible spouses and beneficiaries) to
participate in the Purchaser Plans without being subject to any waiting
periods or any restrictions or limitations for pre-existing conditions,
except to the extent any such person has not satisfied any corresponding
applicable waiting period or limitation under the Benefit Plans. The Purchaser
Plans will credit each Company Employee (and any spouses and dependents) with
the amount, if any, paid during the calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs under the Benefit Plans towards deductibles, copays and out-of-pocket
maximums to the extent the Company Employees (and any spouses or dependents)
participate in any such Purchaser Plan.

(c) _401(k) Plan_. Effective as of the Closing Date, the Sellers shall cause
all Company Employees to be fully vested in their benefits under the Sellers
defined contribution plan (" _Seller s DC Plan_"), which is intended to be
"qualified" under Section 401(a) of the Code. After Closing, Seller will
make distributions of accounts under Sellers DC Plan available to all
Company Employees, and Sellers DC Plan contains or Seller shall cause
Sellers DC Plan to contain all provisions necessary for the making of direct
rollovers (in the form of cash and/or notes relating to participant loans).
Purchasers defined contribution plan (" _Purchaser s DC Plan_"), which is
intended to be "qualified" under Section 401(a) of the Code, contains
or Purchase shall cause Purchasers DC Plan to contain all provisions
necessary for the acceptance of direct rollovers (in the form of cash and/or
notes relating to participant loans) of "eligible rollover distributions" as
defined in the Code and applicable Law that Company Employees are eligible to
receive from the Sellers DC Plan. Purchaser, the Companies and Seller will
cooperate with each other to enable such direct rollovers to occur before such
loans become defaulted.

(d) _Welfare Plans_. The Sellers or its Affiliates (other than the Companies)
will retain all liabilities for claims incurred by a Company Employee (and
his or her eligible spouse and dependents) on or prior to the Closing Date
under the Benefit Plans that are welfare benefit plans within the meaning of
Section 3(1) of ERISA and all short term disability, salary continuation,
severance plans or arrangements (the " _Welfare Plans_ "). Purchaser will, or
will cause the Companies or one of their Affiliates, to establish or continue
to maintain one or more Purchaser Plans so as to provide benefits to Company
Employees under such plans without any break in coverage or benefits, and
Purchaser, the Companies, one of their Affiliates or such Purchaser Plan(s)
will be responsible for all liabilities for claims incurred by a
Company Employee (and his or her eligible spouse and dependents) after the
Closing Date under the Welfare Plans. For this purpose claims under any
medical, dental, vision, or prescription drug plan generally will be deemed to
be incurred on the date that the service giving rise to such claim is  



 

27  performed and not when such claim is made; _provided_ , _however_ , that
with respect to claims relating to hospitalization, the claim will be
deemed to be incurred on the first day of such hospitalization and not on the
date that such services are performed. Claims for disability under any long or
short term disability plan will be incurred on the date the Company Employee
is first absent from work because of the condition giving rise to such
disability and not when the Company Employee is determined to be eligible for
benefits under the applicable Welfare Plan. The applicable Seller will provide
any continuation coverage required under Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or
applicable state law (" _COBRA_ ") to each "qualified beneficiary" as that
term is defined in COBRA whose first "qualifying event" (as defined in COBRA)
occurs on or prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser, the Companies, or one of
their Affiliates will provide all COBRA continuation coverage to each
"qualified beneficiary" as that term is defined in COBRA whose first
"qualifying event" (as defined in COBRA) occurs after the Closing Date.

(e) _Pension Benefits_. Each non-union Company Employee shall be referred to
herein as a " _Company Non-Union Employee_ " and each union Company Employee
shall be referred to herein as a " _Company Union Employee_."

(i) _Pension Benefits of Company Non-Union Employees_. For 12 months after the
Closing Date, the Company Non-Union Employees will participate in a defined
benefit plan (within the meaning of 3(35) of ERISA), with a related trust or
trusts intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the
Code, maintained by Purchaser or an Affiliate (the " _Purchaser Non-Union
Pension Plan_ "), on the same basis as other Purchaser non-union employees,
as of the date of this Agreement (subject to any changes that may be effected
to the terms of such participation after the Closing in accordance with the
terms of the Purchaser Non-Union Pension Plan), provided that, the foregoing
shall not limit Purchasers obligations pursuant to _Section 4.5(b)(ii)_.
Both before and after the Closing Date, Seller will retain all liabilities
under the applicable Seller Pension Plan with respect to present and former
nonunion employees of the Companies, including all Company Non-Union
Employees.

(ii) _Pension Benefits of Company Union Employees_.

(A) Transfer of Liabilities and Obligations.

(1) As of the Closing Date, Purchaser will, or will cause the Companies to
provide that the Company Union Employees will participate in one or
more defined benefit plans (within the meaning of Section 3(35) of ERISA),
with a related trust or trusts intended to be "qualified" within the meaning
of Section 401(a) of the Code, maintained by Purchaser or an Affiliate (all
such plans collectively, the " _Purchaser Union Pension Plan_ "). In
accordance with Section 414(l) of the Code, Seller will cause the applicable
Seller Pension Plans to spin-off and transfer to the Purchaser Union Pension
Plan all pension obligations and liabilities that are accrued and payable
under the Seller Pension Plan to or with respect to all Company Union
Employees. The Purchaser Union Pension Plan will provide that (1) the Company
Union Employees accrued benefits under the Seller Pension Plans will be
transferred to and credited under the Purchaser Union Pension Plan and (2) the
Company Union Employees periods of service credited under the Seller Pension
Plans will be credited for purposes of determining benefit accrual, vesting
and eligibility under the Purchaser Pension Plan. Each Company Union Employee
will participate in the Purchaser Union Pension Plan as of the Closing Date,
on terms that satisfy the requirements of the collective bargaining agreement
covering the Company Union Employee (subject to any changes that may be
effected to the terms of such participation after Closing in accordance with
the terms of the Purchaser Union Pension Plan). Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Seller Pension Plans will continue to process
and make all benefit payments and distributions to the Company Union Employees
due under the Seller Pension Plans until the Pension Trust Transfer Date.

 



 

28 (2) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Seller will deliver to
Purchaser a list reflecting each Company Union Employees service and
compensation under the Seller Pension Plans, and each Company Union Employees
accrued benefit thereunder as of the Closing Date.

(B) _Transfer of Assets_.

(1) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Seller will direct its
actuary to determine, in compliance with Section 414(l) of the Code, the
actuarial present value of the accrued plan benefits of the Company Employees
in the Seller Pension Plans as of the Closing Date based on Section 4044 of
ERISA and using the safe harbor assumptions set forth therein (the " _Section
4044 Amount_"). Not more than 90 days following the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Purchaser a report from its actuary setting forth the
Section 4044 Amount and the assumptions upon which it was based.

(2) Promptly (but not more than 14 days) following delivery of the
calculations referred to in _Section 4.5(e)(ii)(B)(1)_, Seller will cause the
assets held in each Seller Pension Plan Trust (determined as of immediately
before the Closing) to be allocated between the Seller Pension Plan Trust and
the Purchaser Pension Plan Trust in accordance with Section 414(l) of the Code
and Section 4044 of ERISA to reflect the division of accrued plan benefits
between the Seller Pension Plans and the Purchaser Pension Plan, as
contemplated by _Section 4.5(e)(ii)(A)_, and the portion of such assets
allocated to the Purchaser Pension Plan to be transferred (in cash or in-kind
as may be mutually agreed by Seller and Purchaser) to the Purchaser Pension
Plan Trust (the date of such transfer, the " _Pension Trust Transfer Date_ ").

(3) From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser Union Pension Plan will
process and make all benefit payments and distributions to the Company Union
Employees due under the Purchaser Union Pension Plan, including with respect
to benefits accrued under the Seller Pension Plans prior to the Closing Date.
Both before and after the Closing Date, Seller will retain all liabilities
with respect to former employees of the Company who terminated prior to or on
the Closing date regardless of whether such former employees are deferred
vested participants or participants in pay status.

(f) Except as provided in this  _Section 4.5_, neither Purchaser nor any of
its Affiliates shall have any liability with respect to any Benefit Plans or
with respect to any obligations thereunder.

(g) _No Modification_. Nothing in this _Section 4.5_, express or implied, is
intended to be, shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to or
modification of any employee benefit plan or arrangement of either Seller,
Purchaser, the Companies or any of their Affiliates or limit in any way the
right of either Seller, Purchaser, the Companies or any of their Affiliates
to amend, modify or terminate any of its respective employee benefit plans or
arrangements.

Section 4.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_. For a period of six
years following the Closing Date, the provisions of the articles of
incorporation, the bylaws and the other similar corporate governance
instruments of each Company concerning elimination of liability and
indemnification of directors and officers shall not be amended in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Person that is as of
the date hereof or as of the Closing Date an officer or director of
either Company.

Section 4.7 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, whether or not
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with  



 

29  this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
paid by the Party incurring such expense, except that Purchaser shall pay
the filing fees associated with the filing of notification and report forms
under HSR Act.

Section 4.8 _Control of Seller s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct either of the Sellers operations prior to the Closing Date in
violation of any applicable Law. Prior to the Closing Date, each of the
Sellers and Purchaser shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its respective
operations.

Section 4.9 _Necessary Action_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, neither of the Sellers nor Purchaser shall take or knowingly fail
to take any action that such Party reasonably believes is likely to result in
any failure of the conditions to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement set forth in _Article VI_. Subject to the preservation of attorney-
client privilege and applicable Law, each Seller and Purchaser shall permit

communications (whether in person, by telephone or otherwise) with
Governmental Entities with respect to approvals or satisfaction of the other
conditions to Closing contained in _Section 6.1(a)_.

Section 4.10  _Intangible Property Use Phase Out_.

(a) " _Retained IP_ " means the trademarks, service marks, brand
names, copyrights, logos or trade, corporate or business names of Seller and

MATTERS RELATED TO TAXES

Section 5.1 _Tax Indemnification_.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Sellers will be jointly and severally liable for, will pay, and will
indemnify and hold Purchaser Indemnified Parties (as defined in _Section
7.2(a)_) harmless against, all Excluded Taxes.

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 5.1(a)_ above, Purchaser will be liable
for, will pay, and will indemnify Seller Indemnified Parties (as defined in
_Section 7.2(b)_) against any and all Taxes imposed on or payable with
respect to either Company or its business for Post- Closing Tax Periods (or
any portion thereof).

(c) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each of Purchaser and
Sellers will be responsible for one-half of any and all transfer Taxes
that may be imposed upon, payable, collectible or incurred in connection
herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of the Person
liable for such transfer Taxes under applicable Law. The Sellers and Purchaser
will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the amount of such
transfer Taxes and shall cooperate in timely making all filings, returns,
reports and forms as may be required to comply with the provisions of such Tax
Laws.

(d) For purposes of _Section 5.1_, in the case of Taxes that are payable with
respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable
to the Pre-Closing Period shall be:

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income
or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended on and
included the Closing Date; and



 

32 (ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the
assets of either Company, or otherwise measured by the level of any item,
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case
of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on and including the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire period.

(e) The applicable Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, will provide
reimbursement for any Tax paid by one Party, all or a portion of which is
the responsibility of the other Party pursuant to this _Section 5.1_.
Payment by the indemnifying Party of any amount due under this _Section 5.1_
will be made within 10 days following written notice by the indemnified Party
that payment of such amount is due and without right of offset; _provided_ ,
that, if the indemnified Party is required to make a payment to a taxing
authority, the indemnifying Party will not be required to make any payment
earlier than three days before such payment is due.

(f) Notwithstanding any language in _Article VII_ to the contrary, the
provisions of _Article V_  shall govern all claims for indemnification for
Taxes.

Section 5.2 _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Seller or Seller Parent will timely prepare and file or will cause to be
timely prepared and filed (giving effect to any validly obtained extensions)
(i) any combined, consolidated or unitary Income Tax Return that includes
either Company on the one hand and Seller Parent, Seller or any of either
Persons other Affiliates on the other hand, and (ii) any Tax Return
of either Company for any Pre-Closing Period (collectively, " _Seller Tax
Returns_ "). All Seller Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practice.

(b) Purchaser will, except to the extent that such Tax Returns are the
responsibility of Sellers under _Section 5.2(a)_, timely prepare and file or
will cause to be timely prepared and filed all Tax Returns with respect to
each Company. For any Straddle Period Tax Return of each Company that is the
responsibility of Purchaser under this _Section 5.2(b)_, the Party filing
such Tax Return pursuant to _Section 5.2(a)_ will deliver to the other Party
for its review, comment and approval (which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) a copy of such proposed Tax Return or, to the extent such
Tax Return is filed on a combined, unified, or consolidated basis, a pro
forma Tax Return of such Company (and, with respect to a Straddle Period Tax
Return, an allocation between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing
Period of the Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Return) at least 30 days
prior to the due date (giving effect to any validly obtained extensions)
thereof.

(c) Seller Parent or Seller shall pay or cause to be paid when due and
payable in the manner prescribed by applicable law all Income Taxes properly
shown on a Tax Return that Seller or Seller Parent is required to file (or
cause to be filed) pursuant to the terms of paragraph (a) above, and, subject
to _Section 5.1_, Purchaser shall do the same with respect to all Taxes
properly shown on a Tax Return that Purchaser is required to file (or cause to
be filed) pursuant to the terms of paragraph (a) above.



 

33 Section 5.3 _Refunds, Credits and Carrybacks_.

(a) The Sellers will be entitled to any refunds or credits of or against any
Excluded Taxes and Purchaser shall be entitled to all other refunds
or credits of or against any other Taxes. Purchaser or the applicable Seller
(as the case may be) will, at the other Partys reasonable request and,
subject to _Section 5.1(a)_, at the requesting Partys sole expense, cause
the relevant entity to file for and use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any refund or credit to which the requesting Party is entitled under
applicable Law.

(b) Purchaser will cause each Company promptly to forward to the applicable
Seller or to reimburse the applicable Seller for any refunds or credits due
such Seller, including any interest thereon that is paid to Purchaser with
respect to such refund or credit by a Governmental Entity (pursuant to the
terms of this _Article V_ ) after Purchaser has actually received such refund
or actually reduced its Tax liability by the amount of such credit,
and Seller Parent or Seller will promptly forward to Purchaser or reimburse
Purchaser for any refunds or credits due Purchaser, including any interest
thereon that is paid to Seller or Seller Parent with respect to such refund or
credit by a Governmental Entity (pursuant to the terms of this _Article V_ )
after Seller, Seller Parent or any of their Affiliates has actually received
such refund or actually reduced its Tax liability by the amount of such
credit.

(c) Purchaser agrees that neither Company will elect to carry back any item of
loss, deduction or credit that arises in any taxable period ending after the
Closing Date and that relates to or affects any Excluded Tax (a " _Subsequent
Loss_ ") into any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date.
Purchaser agrees to make the election to forego any such loss carryback
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)(b).

Section 5.4 _Section 338 Election_.

(a) Purchaser and Seller Parent, Seller and any of their Affiliates shall
jointly make a timely election pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code, Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 and any analogous election
under applicable state and local law (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10)
Election_") with respect to the purchase by Purchaser of the Company
Shares pursuant to this Agreement, in which case (i) with respect to the
federal election, Purchaser shall prepare a Form 8023 (with all attachments)
in accordance with this _Section 5.4_ and deliver such form to Seller for
Sellers review and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, (ii) Seller Parent, Seller and any of their
relevant Affiliates will sign such forms and authorize Purchaser to file the
completed and signed election forms as required by applicable Law, (iii)
Purchaser and Seller Parent, Seller and their Affiliates shall report the
purchase by Purchaser of the Company Shares for federal and state Income Tax
purposes consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election, and as a sale of
stock (and not a sale of assets) for all other tax purposes, and neither the
Purchaser nor either Seller shall take (or permit any Affiliate to take) any
position to the contrary thereto in any Tax Return or any Tax Proceeding,
unless such position is, as a result of a "final determination" (as such term
is defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code), decided or agreed to be incorrect,
and (iv) Seller Parent shall include any Taxes imposed with respect to the
gain recognized as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Election on its Income
Tax Returns. The Sellers shall pay any Tax imposed on either of the Companies
or their Affiliates attributable to the making of the Section 338(h)(10)
Election, including any state, local or foreign Tax imposed on the gain of
either of the Companies or their Affiliates, and the Sellers shall indemnify
Purchaser, the Companies, and their Affiliates against any
adverse consequences arising out of such Taxes.

(b) In connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Election, prior to the Closing,
Purchaser and the Seller shall agree upon and prepare a schedule setting
forth the Aggregate Deemed Sales Price and Adjusted Grossed-up Basis (each as
defined under the applicable Treasury Regulations) and the allocation of such
Aggregate Deemed Sales Price and Adjusted Grossed-up Basis among the  



 

34  assets of each Company. Purchaser and Seller shall be bound by such
allocation for purposes of determining any Income Taxes, shall prepare and
file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all Income Tax Returns to be filed
with any taxing authority in a manner consistent with such allocation, and
shall not take (or permit any Affiliate to take) any position inconsistent
with such allocation on federal or applicable state income Tax Return or in
any Tax Proceeding, unless such position is, as a result of a "final
determination" (as such term is defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code),
decided or agreed to be incorrect. If Seller and Purchaser cannot agree upon
any item on the schedule, such disputed item shall be submitted to a
nationally-recognized accounting firm mutually agreed to by the Parties (the "
_Accountant_ ") along with each Partys position with respect thereto and the
Accountant shall provide its determination with respect to such disputed items
based on the positions of the Parties and such determination shall be binding
on the Parties. To the extent necessary, the allocation shall be adjusted to
reflect any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement
(including pursuant to _Section 1.5_ of this Agreement).

(c) In the event that any allocation described in _Section 5.4(b)_ is
questioned, audited or disputed by any taxing authority, the Party receiving
notice thereof shall promptly notify the other Party and the provisions of
_Section 5.5_ shall govern any Tax Claim that might arise in connection with
a challenge of the allocation agreed upon pursuant to _Section 5.4(b)_.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Article V_ and _Article VII_ shall not be interpreted in any manner that
would require Purchaser or its Affiliates to be liable for or indemnify the
Sellers or their Affiliates against any Taxes imposed on either Seller or
their Affiliates with respect to the gain recognized by such Seller for Tax
purposes with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.5 _Tax Contests_.

(a) If any taxing authority asserts or proposes a Tax Claim in respect of
either Company, then the Party hereto first receiving notice of such Tax
Claim promptly will provide written notice thereof to the other Party hereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of such Party to give such prompt
notice will not relieve the other Party of any of its obligations under this
_Article V_ , except to the extent that the other Party is materially
prejudiced thereby. Such notice will specify in reasonable detail the basis
for such Tax Claim to the extent the Party giving such notice is aware of such
basis and will include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence
received from the taxing authority.

(b) Subject to _Section 5.5(d)_, the Sellers will have the right to control,
at their own expense, any audit, examination, contest, litigation or other
proceeding by or against any taxing authority (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") in
respect of each Company that solely involves Excluded Taxes; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) Purchaser will be entitled to participate in such Tax
Proceeding and receive copies of any written materials relating to such Tax
Proceeding received from the relevant taxing authority, and (ii) the Sellers
will not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without
obtaining the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

the Controlling Party will have the right to control, at its own
expense, such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Non-
Controlling Party will be entitled to participate in such Tax Proceeding, at
its own expense, if such Tax Proceeding could have an adverse impact on the
Non-Controlling Party or any of its Affiliates and (ii) the Controlling Party
will not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without
obtaining the prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, of the Non-Controlling Party.



 

35 (d) Purchaser will have the right to control (i) any Tax Proceeding involving
either Company (other than a Tax Proceeding described in clauses (b) and (c)
of this _Section 5.5_), and (ii) notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, all Tax Proceedings relating to a consolidated,
unified, or combined group that includes a Company on the one hand and
Purchaser or any of its other Affiliates on the other hand if such Tax
Proceeding involves issues or matters that do not relate solely to Excluded
Taxes.

(e) The Controlling Party will indemnify and hold the Non-Controlling Party,
its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees
and agents, harmless from any Taxes (and any related costs imposed by a court
or other tribunal) arising out of or resulting from the Controlling Partys
failure to comply with its obligations under clauses (b) or (c) of this 
_Section 5.5_, as the case may be.

Section 5.6 _Cooperation_. Each Party hereto will, and will cause
its Affiliates to, provide to the other Party hereto (and its consultants,
advisors and auditors) such cooperation, documentation and information as
either of them reasonably may request in (a) filing any Tax Return, amended
Tax Return or claim for refund, (b) determining a liability for Taxes or an
indemnity obligation under this _Article V_ or a right to refund of or credit
for Taxes, (c) conducting any Tax Proceeding, (d) preparing financial

taxing authorities and relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax basis
of property and other information, that any such Party may possess. Each
Party will retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, and all material
records and other documents relating to Tax matters, of the relevant entities
for their respective Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date until
the expiration of the statute of limitations, including extensions thereto,
plus one year, for the Tax periods to which the Tax Returns and other
documents relate. Thereafter, the Party holding such Tax Returns or other
documents may dispose of them after offering the other Party reasonable
notice and opportunity to take possession of such Tax Returns and other
documents at such other Partys own expense. Each Party will make its
employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis (at the cost of
the requesting Party, unless such request relates to a matter against which
the requesting Party is indemnified pursuant to this _Article V_ ) to provide
assistance pursuant to this  _Section 5.6_.

Section 5.7 _Survival of Obligations_. The obligations of the parties set
forth in this Article V and the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 2.11_ shall remain in effect for the period of 60 days after the

2.15_ (Brokers and Finders), _Section 3.1_ (Organization, Good Standing and
Qualification),  _Section 3.2_ (Authorization, Validity and Execution) and

Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that any claims of a breach of any
such surviving representation or warranty made in good faith by notice in
writing given prior to such termination date will survive such date to the
extent of the facts alleged in such claim.

Section 7.2 _Indemnification other than for Taxes_.

(a) _Indemnification by Sellers_. Following the Closing, subject to the
survival periods set forth in _Section 7.1_ and the limitations set forth in
_Section 7.3_, the Sellers will jointly and severally indemnify Purchaser,
its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents
(the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") against, and hold them harmless
from, any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) (collectively, " _Losses_ ") arising
from:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty (without regard to any
qualifier as to materiality or material adverse effect) of the Sellers in this
Agreement (other than with respect to Taxes, which are covered by _Article V_
), 

(ii) any breach of any covenant by the Sellers set forth in this Agreement
(other than with respect to Taxes, which are covered by _Article V_ );

(iii) any liability of the Companies relating to the pending regulatory
proceedings listed on  _Section 7.2(a)(iii)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule; and

(iv) any liability of the Companies relating to any regulatory fines, fees or
disallowances with respect to events or actions occurring prior to the Closing
Date that are not disclosed on the Seller Disclosure Schedules and are the
subject of a regulatory proceeding commenced and docketed by the MPUC or the
NHPUC prior to the Closing Date, provided that subject to the limitations of
_Section 7.3_, Sellers shall only be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of
such liabilities.

(b) _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Following the Closing, subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section 7.3_, Purchaser will indemnify the
Sellers, their Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees
and agents (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ "), against, and hold them
harmless from, any Losses arising from:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty (without regard to any
qualifier as to materiality or material adverse effect) of Purchaser or
Purchaser in this Agreement (other than with respect to Taxes, which are
covered by _Article V_ ), and



 

40 (ii) any breach of any covenant by Purchaser or Purchaser set forth in this
Agreement (other than with respect to Taxes, which are covered by _Article V_
).

Section 7.3 _Limits on Indemnification_. 

(a) The Sellers will not be required to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified
Party pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_, (x) for any individual item where Losses
relating thereto for which the Sellers would otherwise be required to
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties hereunder are less than $100,000
and (y) unless the aggregate amount of Losses for which the Sellers would
otherwise be required to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties hereunder
exceeds one percent (1%) of the Purchase Price, and in such case the Sellers
will only be required to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for
aggregate Losses in excess of the first one percent (1%) of the Purchase
Price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the maximum aggregate amount of Losses for which the Sellers will be obligated
to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under _Section 7.2(a)_ will
be an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price.

(b) In case any event occurs which would otherwise entitle either Party to
assert a claim for indemnification under this _Article VII_ , no Losses will
be deemed to have been sustained by such Party to the extent of (i) any net
Tax benefit actually realized by such Party arising from the incurrence or
payment of any such Loss (such benefit to be determined as having been
actually realized to the extent there is a savings in Tax liability after
taking into account all of the other Tax attributes of such party and its
Affiliates), or (ii) any proceeds received or to be received by such Party
from any insurance policies with respect thereto.

(c) An Indemnifying Party will not be liable under this _Article VII_ for (i)
any Losses which represent the cost of repairs, replacements or improvements
to the extent they clearly enhance the value of the repaired, replaced or
improved asset above its value on the Closing Date, or which represent the
cost of repair or replacement in excess of the lowest reasonable cost of such
repair or replacement, or (ii) consequential damages, special damages,
incidental damages, indirect damages, punitive damages, lost profits relating
to the same or losses based on a multiple of earnings, or similar items or
(iii) any Losses that have been recovered or are approved for recovery by
either Company under its approved rates.

(d) To the extent that an Indemnifying Party discharges any claim for
indemnification under this _Article VII_ , such Indemnifying Party will be
subrogated to all related rights of the Indemnified Party against third
parties.

(e) Each Indemnified Party will be obligated in connection with any claim for
indemnification under _Section 7.2_ to use commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to such Losses.

Section 7.4 _Procedure for Indemnification_. Any Party seeking indemnification
under this _Article VII_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") will give each Party
from whom indemnification is being sought (each, an " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
notice of any matter for which such Indemnified Party is seeking
indemnification, stating the amount of the Losses, if known, and method of
computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or
arises. The obligations of an Indemnifying Party under this _Article VII_ with
respect to Losses arising from any claims of any third party which are subject
to the indemnification provided for in this _Article VII_ (collectively, "
_Third-Party Claims_ ") will be governed by and contingent upon the following
additional terms and conditions: If an Indemnified Party receives, after the
Closing Date, initial notice of any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
will give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third-Party Claim as soon as
practicable following receipt by the Indemnified Party of  



 

41  such notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such
timely notice will not release the Indemnifying Party from any of
its obligations under this _Article VII_ , except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party will
be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third-Party Claim at its
expense and through counsel of its choice if it gives notice of its intention
to do so to the Indemnified Party within 30 days of the receipt of such notice
from the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that if there exists a
conflict of interest (including the availability of one or more legal
defenses to the Indemnified Party which are not available to the Indemnifying
Party) that would make it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of the
Indemnified Party (upon and in conformity with advice of counsel) for the
same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party, then the Indemnified Party will be entitled to retain one counsel (plus
one local counsel, if necessary), reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying
Party, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, _provided_ that the
Indemnified Party and such counsel will contest such Third-Party Claims in
good faith. In the event the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to
undertake any such defense against any such Third-Party Claim as provided
above, the Indemnified Party will cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in
such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Partys
possession or under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is
reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. Similarly, in the event the
Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against
any such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will cooperate with the
Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified Party
all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying
Partys possession or under the Indemnifying Partys control relating thereto
as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
will not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), settle or compromise any Third-Party
Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to
Indemnified Party of a written release from all liability in respect of such
Third-Party Claim. No Third-Party Claim which is being defended in good faith
by the Indemnifying Party or which is being defended by the Indemnified Party
as provided above in this  _Section 7.4_ will be settled by the Indemnified
Party without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Section 7.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Following the Closing, except as provided in
_Article V_ , the indemnification provided for in this  _Article VII_ will
constitute the sole remedy of any Party to the Agreement with respect to (a)
breaches by the other Party to the Agreement of any of the representations,
warranties, agreements or covenants contained herein or in certificates
delivered pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)(ii)_ or _Section 6.3(c)(ii)_, (b) any
events, circumstances or conditions which are the subject of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
the Agreement or in certificates delivered pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)(ii)_
or _Section 6.3(c)(ii)_, (c) any other matters related to the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement and (d) any other events, circumstances
or conditions relating to the ownership or operation of the Companies prior
to the Closing Date.

Section 7.6 _Counsel Representation_.

(a) In any proceeding by or against any Purchaser Indemnified Party wherein
any Purchaser Indemnified Party asserts or prosecutes any claim under, or
otherwise seeks to enforce, this Agreement, Purchaser agrees in connection
with such proceeding (a) that no Purchaser Indemnified Party or counsel
therefor will move to seek disqualification of Schiff Hardin LLP, (b) to
waive any right any Purchaser Indemnified Party may have to assert the
attorney-client privilege against Schiff Hardin LLP or either Seller or any of
their Affiliates with respect to any communication or information contained
in Schiff Hardin LLPs possession or files and (c) to consent to the
representation of either Seller and their Affiliates by Schiff Hardin LLP,
notwithstanding that Schiff Hardin LLP has or may have represented either
Seller and their Affiliates as counsel in connection with any matter,
including any transaction (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), negotiation, investigation, proceeding or action, prior to the
Closing.



 

42 (b) In any proceeding by or against any Seller Indemnified Party wherein any
Seller Indemnified Party asserts or prosecutes any claim under, or otherwise
seeks to enforce, this Agreement, Seller agrees in connection with such
proceeding (a) that no Seller Indemnified Party or counsel therefor will move
to seek disqualification of Dewey and LeBoeuf LLP, (b) to waive any right any
Seller Indemnified Party may have to assert the attorney-client privilege
against Dewey and LeBoeuf LLP or the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates with
respect to any communication or information contained in Dewey and LeBoeuf
LLPs possession or files and (c) to consent to the representation of
Purchaser and its Affiliates by Dewey and LeBoeuf LLP, notwithstanding that
Dewey and LeBoeuf LLP has or may have represented the Purchaser and its
Affiliates as counsel in connection with any matter, including any transaction
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), negotiation,
investigation, proceeding or action, prior to the Closing.

that such item or other matter is material or that such item or other matter
