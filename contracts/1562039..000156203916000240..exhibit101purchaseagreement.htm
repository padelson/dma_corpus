at the Closing, Buyers shall assume and agree to pay, perform and discharge
when due in accordance with their respective terms only the following
Liabilities of Sellers (collectively, the "Assumed Liabilities"), and no other
Liabilities:

(i) all Liabilities under the Assumed Contracts to the extent such Liabilities
relate to periods occurring at or after the Effective Time or events or
circumstances first occurring at or after the Effective Time (provided,
however, that a Liability shall not be deemed to relate to such periods,
events or circumstances merely because a related Proceeding is brought after
the Effective Time with respect to events or circumstances occurring prior to
the Effective Time), to the extent assigned and to the extent such Liabilities
do not relate to any failure to perform, improper performance, warranty or
other breach, default or violation (or any event





that with or without notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
failure to perform, improper performance, warranty or other breach, default or
violation) by any Seller prior to the Effective Time;

(ii) all Liabilities relating to the employment by any Buyer or its Affiliates
of any Transferring Employee or the engagement of any independent contractor
by any Buyer or its Affiliate, in each case first arising at or after the

above, the "Assumed Environmental Liabilities"); provided, however, that the

not assume, any Liabilities (including Environmental Liabilities) of any prior
owner or operator of the Business related to Preexisting Environmental
Conditions for which a Seller is not directly or indirectly liable; and (B)

periods merely because a related Proceeding is brought after the Effective

disclosure to Buyers, Sellers and Buyers agree that Buyers shall not assume
and shall not be responsible to pay, perform or discharge (and Sellers shall
retain, pay, perform or otherwise discharge without recourse to Buyers) any

the foregoing, except to the extent they expressly constitute Assumed
Liabilities in Section 2.3(a), the Excluded Liabilities include, without

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS

Sellers, jointly and severally, hereby represent and warrant to Buyers as
follows:

Section 3.1 Due Organization and Power. Each Seller is a duly formed
corporation or limited liability company, as applicable, validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Each Seller has all
requisite corporate or limited liability company power and authority, as
applicable, to own, operate or lease its assets and properties now owned,
operated or leased by it and to carry on the Business as now conducted. Each
Seller is duly qualified or licensed to transact business as a foreign entity,
and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the ownership,
operation or lease of the Assets or the operation of the Business as now
conducted makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed is not and would not reasonably be
expected to be materially adverse to the ability of such Seller to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements to
which it is a party or result in the imposition of a Lien on any of the
Assets.





Section 3.2 Authority. Each Seller has full power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to be executed and
delivered by such Seller pursuant to this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution, delivery and performance
by each Seller of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to be executed
and delivered by each Seller pursuant hereto and the consummation by each
Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and
validly authorized by the board of directors or other such governing body of
each Seller. No other organizational act or proceeding on the part of any
Seller is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements to be executed and delivered by
each Seller pursuant hereto or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement constitutes, and when executed
and delivered, the Ancillary Agreements to be executed and delivered by
Sellers pursuant hereto shall constitute, valid and binding obligations of
each Seller, as the case may be, enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or
other similar Laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally, or by general equitable principles.

Section 3.3 No Violation. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.3 and for such
filings as may be required under the HSR Act, neither the execution, delivery
or performance by each Seller of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements to
be executed and delivered by such Seller pursuant hereto nor the performance
of such Seller hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by such Seller of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (i) shall conflict, breach or
violate any material Law applicable to such Seller, the Business or the
Assets, (ii) shall require any authorization, consent, qualification, Permit,
Order, declaration, filing, registration or approval by, filing with or notice
to any Governmental Entity or other third party except such that is lawfully
and validly obtained prior to the Closing, or (iii) shall breach or violate or
conflict with, or constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse
of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, or shall result in the
termination, cancellation or modification that is materially adverse to Buyers
of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation or
imposition of any Liens (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the Assets
under, (A) any term or provision of the corporate charter, bylaws, or similar
organizational documents of such Seller or (B) any Contract to which such
Seller is a party or by which such Seller is bound, including any Assumed
Contract.

Section 3.4 Tax Matters.

in respect of the Assets, whether or not shown on any Tax Return as owing,

through appropriate proceedings. To the Knowledge of Sellers, no claim has
ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction where a Seller does not file
Tax Returns that a Seller is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction in respect of the Assets. Each Seller has withheld and paid all
Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with any amounts
paid or owing to any employee,





independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other third party relating
to the Assets, and all Forms W-2 and 1099 required with respect thereto have
been properly completed and timely filed.

of limitations for a Tax assessment applicable to any Tax Returns relating to
the Assets with respect to a taxable period for which such statute of
limitations is still open.

use property" within the meaning of Code Section 168(h)(1), (ii) "tax-exempt
bond financed property" within the meaning of Code Section 168(g), or (iii)
described in Code Section 168(g)(1)(A) with respect to which any Seller or any
of its affiliates has claimed depreciation deductions in determining its U.S.
federal income tax liability.

representations contain the sole and exclusive representations and warranties
of Sellers with respect to Tax matters.

Section 3.5 No Litigation. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.5, there is no
Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened against any
Seller or Affiliate thereof in respect of the Business or affecting any of the
Assets, at law or in equity, or before or by any Governmental Entity. None of
the Proceedings set forth in Schedule 3.5 has or would, individually,
reasonably be expected to result in any loss to the Business or the Assets
greater than $100,000 or, individually or in the aggregate, otherwise have a
Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.5, there has been
and there is no Order or letters of deficiency of any Governmental Entity

prohibit or make illegal, alter or delay the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements.

Seller (i) is in violation in any material respect of any Law with respect to
its ownership, lease or operation of the Assets or the conduct or operation of

written, or to the Knowledge of Sellers oral, notice of any alleged violation

protection or (B) such examination could contravene any Law, fiduciary duty or
binding agreement entered into prior to the Effective Date, except that

relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Business, the Assets or

been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.5 or that relates
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any
Party's receipt of information pursuant to this Section 5.3(a) shall not
operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty or
agreement given or made by such Party in this Agreement, or any rights or
remedies of such Party hereunder, and shall not be deemed to amend or

(b) From time to time prior to the Closing, Sellers shall promptly supplement

circumstance hereafter arising, which, if existing, occurring or known at the
Effective Date, would have been required to be set forth or described in the

warranties made by Sellers for purposes of Buyers' closing conditions set

Section 10.1 or Buyers' right to indemnification under ARTICLE VIII with
respect to such Schedule Supplements, which conditions, termination rights and
indemnification rights shall be the same as would have existed had such
Schedule Supplements not been delivered.

Section 5.4 Efforts; Filings.

(a) Under the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement (including
Section 5.6, Section 5.8, Section 5.11 and Section 5.12), except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, each Buyer and each Seller shall (and shall cause
its Affiliates to) use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to take,
agree to take, or cause to be taken, any and all actions and to do, or cause
to be done, any and all things necessary, proper or advisable under any Law or
otherwise, so as to, as promptly as practicable, consummate Buyers' purchase,
and Sellers' sale, of the Assets and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including (i) defending against
any Proceeding challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) seeking to have any Order entered or

non-appealable vacated or reversed, (iii) cooperating with the other Parties
to obtain all actions, non-actions, approvals, clearances, waivers, consents,
Permits, approvals, authorizations, licenses, qualifications and Orders from,
or filing or registration with or notice to, Governmental Entities as are
necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and (iv) refrain from taking any
actions that would reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay or
impede the Closing; provided, however, that (x) Sellers, together with their
Affiliates, shall not be required to commence or participate in any litigation
or offer or grant any material accommodation (material or otherwise) to any
third Person and (y) no Party shall be required to waive any of the conditions
set forth in ARTICLE VII. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 5.4(a)
shall not be applicable to HSR Regulatory Approval, which is specifically
addressed by Sections 5.4(b), 5.4(c) and 5.4(d).

(b) Each of Sellers and Buyers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
not cause or, with respect to its controlled Representatives permit, any act
or omission to act that would reasonably be expected to cause any of the
representations and warranties of Sellers or Buyers, respectively, contained
herein not to be true and correct in any material respect if such
representations and warranties were made immediately after such act or failure
to act, in either case so as to cause the failure of any condition to the
Closing set forth in either Section 7.1 or Section 7.2, in the case of
Sellers, or Section 7.1 or Section 7.3, in the case of Buyers, respectively,
to be satisfied.

(c) Buyers and Sellers acknowledge that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may require filings with the FTC and the Antitrust Division under
the HSR Act. Without limiting the generality of Section 5.4(a), each of Buyers
and Sellers shall use its commercially





reasonable efforts to obtain any action, non-action, approval, authorization,
clearance, Order, Permit, consent, approval or waiver of all Governmental
Entities required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act (each, a "HSR Regulatory Approval"). In connection
with the HSR Regulatory Approval, Buyers and Sellers shall each, subject to
applicable Law: (i) as promptly as required by applicable Law, but in any
event no later than ten (10) Business Days from the Effective Date, make all
filings or registrations with, notification to, or authorization, consent or
approval of any Governmental Entity required in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by
such Party on its own behalf pursuant to the HSR Act ("HSR Filings"),
reasonably necessary or advisable for such Party to make in connection with
the HSR Regulatory Approval, and thereafter promptly make any other
submissions and responses required of such Party under any applicable Law with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements; (ii) furnish all information reasonably required for any HSR
Filings to be made pursuant to any applicable Law by any other Parties hereto
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements; (iii) act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with

copies of all such HSR Filings to outside counsel for a non-filing Party and,
if requested by such other Party, to consider all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested by such other Party); (iv) if permitted, keep
each other Party informed in all material respects of any material
communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, any
Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case, relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements;
(v) to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, provide each other Party with
prior notice of any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any
Governmental Entity regarding any such HSR Filings; (vi) reasonably consult
and cooperate with each other Party in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals submitted by or on behalf of any Party in connection with
proceedings relating to or arising out of such HSR Filings; and (vii) unless
prohibited by any Governmental Entity, shall give prior notice of any meeting
or conversation with such Governmental Entity in respect of any such HSR
Filings or any investigations or other inquiries relating thereto and, unless
prohibited by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend or
participate in such meeting or conversation; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, information and
materials may be redacted or withheld (1) to the extent that such information
and materials concern or refer to matters other than the Business or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (2) as necessary to comply
with contractual arrangements. Sellers shall bear and pay any and all filing
fees required to be paid by Sellers or Buyers under the HSR Act. Except as
stated in the preceding sentence, Sellers and Buyers shall each bear their own
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of
all materials and information filed or provided under the HSR Act.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in Section 5.4(a) and Section 5.4(b), each Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements under the HSR Act or any other antitrust Law,
including agreeing to any terms, conditions or modifications with respect to
obtaining the expiration or termination of any waiting period or any consents,
Permits, waivers, approvals, non-actions,





clearances, authorizations or Orders in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements).

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall this
Section 5.4 require, or be construed to require, any Buyer or its Affiliates
to, or to offer to, propose or agree to: (i) sell, hold, divest, discontinue
or limit, before or after the Closing Date, any assets, businesses or
interests of such Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any of the Assets, other
than the divestiture of any such assets, businesses or interests that Buyers
determine, in their reasonable discretion, would have an immaterial effect on
the business of such Buyer or Affiliate; (ii) any undertakings or conditions
relating to, or changes or restrictions in, the operations of any such assets,
businesses or interests which, in either case, could reasonably be expected to
result in a material adverse effect or materially and adversely impact the
economic or business benefits to such Buyer of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; or (iii) any material modification or waiver of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

Section 5.5 Exclusivity. During the period commencing on the Effective Date
and expiring on the earlier to occur of the Closing or the date on which this
Agreement is terminated, Sellers shall not, and shall not permit any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives to, directly or indirectly,
encourage, initiate, solicit, make, respond to (other than to decline),
continue, discuss with or provide information or negotiate the terms of any
inquiry, offer or proposal (each, a "Proposal") from or to any Person (other
than from or to any Buyer or its Affiliates and Representatives), or enter
into any agreements or other instruments (whether or not binding) relating to
any acquisition of direct or indirect control of the Business, any purchase of
any of the Assets (other than Inventory in the Ordinary Course of Business),
or any change-of-control or business combination or similar transaction
involving the Business or the Assets, including any merger, consolidation,
acquisition, purchase, re-capitalization or other transaction that would have
a similar result as the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each
Seller shall (and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to) promptly
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted before or on the Effective Date with any Person other than any Buyer
or its Affiliates and Representatives with respect to any Proposal or
potential Proposal. Sellers shall immediately communicate to Buyers the
existence and material terms of any Proposal which any of them may receive
after the Effective Date. Each Seller agrees that the rights and remedies for
noncompliance with this Section 5.5 shall include having such provision
specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it being
acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach shall cause
irreparable injury to Buyers and that money damages would not provide an
adequate remedy to Buyers.

Section 5.6 Environmental Matters.

(a) Environmental Site Assessments. The Station Properties have been and are
being used by Sellers and their respective predecessor(s) in title as retail
gasoline service stations and convenience stores. Prior to the date of this
Agreement, Sellers, at their sole expense, caused The Vertex Companies, Inc.
("Environmental Consultant") to perform a Phase I environmental assessment of
each Station Property (collectively, the "Phase I ESAs"). Sellers have made
available to Buyer true and correct copies of all Phase I ESAs, subject to
Buyers' agreement to maintain confidentiality and return all such Phase I ESAs
to Sellers if this Agreement is terminated. Such





Phase I ESAs have been provided to Buyers without any representations or
warranties of any nature as to their accuracy, completeness or reliability.
Sellers shall assure that the Environmental Consultant prepares a letter in a
form reasonably acceptable to Buyers, extending reliance on the Phase I ESAs
to Buyers, subject to the limitations on liability contained in that letter
and the Phase I ESAs themselves. The cost of the Phase I ESAs shall be paid by
Sellers. Buyers acknowledge and agree that, except as provided in Section
5.6(b), Sellers shall not be required, and Buyers shall not be permitted, to
perform any other environmental testing, investigation, sampling or analysis
on the Station Properties prior to the Closing.

(b) Fuel Equipment Inspections and Repairs.

(i) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date, Sellers,
shall engage the services of Tanknology, Inc. and/or another contractor
mutually acceptable to the Parties (the "Fuel Equipment Contractors"), to
conduct with respect to the Fuel Equipment located on or under each Station
Property, and in accordance with the protocols set forth in Schedule 5.6(b)-1,
(i) a visual inspection of such Fuel Equipment, including under-dispenser
containers or dispenser pans (UDC's), STP and overfill sumps, dispensers, and
vapor recovery equipment, and (ii) a test of such Fuel Equipment, including
testing of underground storage tanks, lines, leak detectors, automatic tank
gauges and cathodic protection testing, if any, which tests and inspections
are described on Schedule 5.6(b)-2 (collectively, the "Fuel Equipment
Inspections"). Sellers shall instruct the Fuel Equipment Contractors to
distribute their final reports for each Station Property to Buyers promptly
upon completion, subject to Buyers' agreement to maintain confidentiality and
return all such reports to Sellers if this Agreement is terminated. Sellers
shall arrange to have their environmental representative at each Station
Property when the testing is conducted in order to make any minor repairs or
adjustments required in order to complete the tests. In addition, Sellers
shall, at their expense, make any repairs necessary to permit the Fuel
Equipment Inspections described in Schedule 5.6(b)-2 to be properly conducted.
Sellers shall arrange to have the Fuel Equipment Inspections performed in
accordance with the timetable set out in Schedule 5.6(b)-2, it being
understood by the Parties that some of the Fuel Equipment Inspections will be
performed after Closing.

(ii) If the Fuel Equipment Inspections, or inspections conducted pursuant to
Section 5.6(b)(i), disclose any leaks, cracks, damage or improper
installation, maintenance or repair in, to or with respect to the Fuel
Equipment that requires Fuel Equipment Repairs in order to comply with
applicable Laws and/or manufacturer specifications or nationally recognized
standards (i.e., PEI, STI, NFPA30 or PCI) (the "Standards"), the Fuel
Equipment Contractors shall promptly advise the Parties and provide an
estimate of the Fuel Equipment Repair Costs. Sellers shall promptly, at their
expense, complete any material Fuel Equipment Repairs (i.e., repair any
identified problems that, absent immediate repair, could result in
Contamination or require tank replacement), provided that Buyers shall
reimburse Sellers for the first $100,000, in the aggregate, of any such Fuel
Equipment Repairs upon receipt by Buyers of documentation of Sellers'
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Sellers shall





use their commercially reasonable efforts to complete such Fuel Equipment
Repairs prior to the Closing Date, except for Station Properties where Fuel
Equipment Inspections are first conducted after the Closing Date; for these
Station Properties, Fuel Equipment Repairs will be performed as promptly as is
reasonably practicable. Sellers shall ensure that all Fuel Equipment Repairs
are completed with oversight from, and consultation with, Buyers in accordance
with Buyer's protocols set forth on Schedule 5.6(b)-1 and in such a manner
that the repaired Fuel Equipment complies with applicable Laws and/or
Standards, and Sellers shall cause the repaired Fuel Equipment (or the
affected component) to be re-tested and, if necessary, re-certified as to
tightness, by the Fuel Equipment Contractors. If the Parties reasonably
determine that a Fuel Equipment Inspection or Fuel Equipment Repairs cannot be
completed prior to the Closing, Sellers shall be responsible for completing
any such post-Closing Fuel Equipment Repairs at their sole expense. Sellers
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to restore the surface condition of
the affected Properties to a condition at least equal to the condition prior
to the repair or replacement. Sellers shall discuss with Buyers any Fuel
Equipment Repairs to be made prior to making such Fuel Equipment Repairs so as
to facilitate the installation of any upgrades or other improvements not
required hereunder that may be contemplated or desired by Buyers. Any such
additional upgrades or improvements desired by Buyers would be done at Buyers'
incremental expense (i.e., above the cost of the Fuel Equipment Repairs to be
otherwise performed by Sellers hereunder).

(iii) If Contamination is identified during Fuel Equipment Inspections or Fuel
Equipment Repairs that does not require Governmental Entities to open an
incident number with respect to such Contamination (generally speaking, minor
petroleum contamination), then Sellers shall in a prompt manner undertake at
their sole cost and expense those Remediation Activities necessary to address
such Contamination in accordance with and to the extent required by applicable
Environmental Law. Such Remediation Activities shall be completed by Sellers
in a good and workmanlike manner with due diligence, in compliance with
applicable Laws and shall be undertaken in such a manner so as not to
interfere in any material respect with Buyers' or their franchisees',
commissioned marketers', consignees' or other third parties' actual or
expected operations at the respective Station Property. Following the Closing,
Buyers shall provide Sellers with reasonable access to the affected Station
Properties in order to perform any required Remediation Activities and, at the
Closing, shall execute and deliver to Sellers a Site Access Agreement, as
defined in Section 6.1(a), for each such Station Property. To the extent
Remediation Activities are necessary, Seller shall ensure that the condition
of the affected properties is restored to its condition prior to the
initiation of such Remediation Activities.

(iv) Sellers shall notify Buyers in writing at least ten (10) days in advance
of performing any Fuel Equipment Repairs, so that Buyers or their consultants
or contractors (such consultants or contractors, "Buyers' Environmental
Consultants") may be present to observe.





(c) Termination as to Property. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if Buyers determine, in their reasonable discretion, prior to
the Closing, that a Material Environmental Condition (other than Retained
Contamination identified on Schedule 1.1(vi)) exists at one or more of the
Station Properties, then Buyers may propose to Sellers a cure for such
Material Environmental Condition. If Sellers reject such cure, then Buyers may
elect to treat such Station Property(ies) as a Rejected Property. As used
herein, a "Material Environmental Condition" shall mean any Contamination that
is discovered after the Effective Date and prior to Closing that requires or
would reasonably be expected to require Governmental Entities to open an
incident number with respect to such Contamination.

Section 5.7 Title to Real Property.

(a) Prior to the date of this Agreement, Sellers have (i) caused the Title
Company to perform a real property title search with regard to the Owned Real
Properties and the Leased Real Properties, and to deliver to Buyers and to
Sellers a commitment for title insurance (each, a "Commitment," and together,
the "Commitments") to be issued by the Title Company with regard to the fee
interests in the Owned Real Properties and the leasehold interests in the
Leased Real Properties and (ii) delivered to Buyers current as-built,
ALTA/ACSM surveys for the Owned Real Properties and the Leased Real Properties
(collectively, the "Surveys"). The cost of obtaining the Commitments and the
Surveys shall be borne in accordance with Section 9.4(b). Buyers may, no later
than thirty (30) days after the Effective Date (the "Title Objection Date"),
deliver written notice to Sellers of any matter set forth in the Commitments
(excluding any Liens or matters created by Buyers' examination or inspection
of the Assets including any entry upon any Real Property in connection
therewith) or the Surveys that is unacceptable to Buyers such matters being
collectively referred to herein as "Defects," and each a "Defect"). If Buyers
do not deliver such written notice to Sellers on or before the Title Objection
Date, Buyers shall be deemed to have waived any right to object to any title
matter, or any other matter set forth in the Commitments and the Surveys,
shall accept title to the Owned Real Properties and the Leased Real
Properties, and shall proceed to the Closing without any reduction in the
Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the following
shall be deemed Defects whether or not included in a notice of Defect and
whether or not any notice of Defect is delivered by Buyers (i) any liens and
encumbrances securing payment of money, (ii) any lis pendens, and (iii) all
matters related to violations of Law or Permits.

(b) If, on or before the Title Objection Date, Buyers deliver written notice
to Sellers of a Defect, Sellers shall, within fifteen (15) days after
receiving such notice, notify Buyers whether Sellers will or will not attempt
to cure such Defect. Failure by Sellers to deliver such notice shall be deemed
Sellers' election not to cure such Defect. If Sellers elect (or are deemed to
have elected) not to attempt to cure a Defect, then, the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by the amount reasonably necessary, as determined in good faith by
Sellers and Buyers to cure such Defect or to account for any diminution in the
value of the applicable Real Property resulting from the existence of such
Defect and upon application of such Purchase Price reduction Buyers shall be
deemed to have waived such Defect or, if the amount to cure such Defect, as
determined in accordance with the foregoing, exceeds 12.5% of the Assigned
Drop Value or materially and adversely affects the ownership or operation of
such Real Property, at Buyers' option, such Real Property shall be designated
as a Rejected Property or would reasonably be expected to do so, in which case
the





Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Assigned Drop Value assigned to the
applicable Station Property on Schedule 2.7 and such affected Real Property
shall no longer be a part of the Assets being transferred hereunder. Any title
matters that are not objected to by Buyers on or before the Title Objection
Date, or are objected to and cured (or not cured but are waived by Buyers as
set forth above) before the Closing, shall be deemed "Permitted Real Property
Encumbrances."

(c) If Sellers elect in writing pursuant to Section 5.7(b) to attempt to cure
a Defect, but at the time of the Closing such Defect has not been cured or
insured over at Seller's cost to Buyers' reasonable satisfaction, then, at
Buyers' option, (i) the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount
reasonably necessary, as determined in good faith by Sellers and Buyers to
cure such Defect or to account for any diminution in the value of the
applicable Real Property resulting from the existence of such Defect and upon
application of such Purchase Price reduction Buyers shall be deemed to have
waived such Defect or (ii) the applicable Real Property shall be designated as
a Rejected Property, in which case the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Assigned Drop Value assigned to the applicable Station Property on Schedule
2.7 and such affected Real Property shall no longer be a part of the Assets
being transferred hereunder.

(d) If at any time after the later of the date that Buyers deliver notice of a
Defect or the Title Objection Date (i) a Commitment or Survey is amended, (ii)
the Title Company or the surveyor otherwise discloses to Buyers or Sellers a
new matter or materially amends any matter previously approved or deemed
approved by Buyers, or (iii) the Title Company materially amends the terms
under which the Title Company is willing to issue its policy of title
insurance, then Buyers shall have ten (10) Business Days from its receipt of
notice of such amendment or disclosure, together with legible copies of all
documents mentioned in such amendment or disclosure, to deliver a notice of
Defect to Sellers.

(e) If a third party exercises a right of first refusal in respect of any Real
Property, including the Real Property Leases more particularly described in
Schedule 1.1(iv), such Real Property shall be designated as a Rejected
Property, in which case the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Assigned
Drop Value assigned to the applicable Station Property on Schedule 2.7 and
such affected Real Property shall no longer be a part of the Assets being
transferred hereunder. Sellers shall provide Buyers with written notice of any
such exercise of a right of first refusal promptly following receipt thereof.

Section 5.8 Leases.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain and deliver to Buyers (i) the written consent of each counterparty to
the Real Property Leases and the Third Party Leases where such consent is
required to assign such lease to the applicable Buyer at the Closing, which
consent shall be in the form required by the applicable Third Party Lease or,
if no form is provided, in a form mutually agreeable to the Parties, and, in
the case of the Ground Leases, shall be in recordable form in the form
required by the applicable Ground Lease, if any such form is provided (each, a
"Lease Consent"), (ii) estoppel certificates from each counterparty under the
Real Property Leases and Third Party Leases, substantially in the form
required by the applicable lease or, if no form is provided for, in a form
mutually agreeable to the Parties (each, a "Lease Estoppel"), and (iii) to the
extent reasonably requested by Buyers,





Subordination and Non-Disturbance Agreements from third party landlords and
their lenders with respect to the Leased Real Properties, in a form mutually
agreeable to the Parties (each, an "SNDA"). Lease Estoppels shall be dated no
more than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that
Sellers shall be obligated for any amounts required to be paid by the
signatories to the Lease Consents, Lease Estoppels and SNDAs. If, despite the
exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, any Seller is unable to (A)
assign any Real Property Lease to the applicable Buyer at the Closing for any
reason, including due to failure to obtain a Lease Consent, or (B) with
respect to any Non-Transferred Contract relating to any Real Property Lease,
enter into a management agreement or similar contractual arrangement with the
applicable Buyer in accordance with Section 5.12(d) or otherwise establish the
applicable Buyer as a proper subtenant pursuant to such Real Property Lease,
having such rights and privileges as mutually agreed upon by the Parties, then
Buyers shall be permitted to designate the applicable Leased Real Property as
a Rejected Property, in which case the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Assigned Drop Value assigned to the applicable Station Property on Schedule
2.7, such affected Station Property shall no longer be a part of the Assets
being transferred hereunder and such Real Property Lease shall no longer be
part of the Assumed Contracts.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if, despite the
exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, any Seller is unable to obtain
any Lease Estoppel for any reason, then Sellers shall deliver to Buyers an
estoppel certificate with respect to the applicable Real Property Lease or
Third Party Lease, in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyers (each, a "Seller
Estoppel"). Delivery of a Seller Estoppel for a Station Property shall not
waive or limit any indemnification rights that any Buyer Indemnified Party has
pursuant to Section 8.2 in respect of any breach or violation of or default
under the applicable Real Property Lease or Third Party Lease.

(c) Subject to Section 5.8(b), (i) no Lease Estoppel will be acceptable if it
reflects any fact or circumstance that is not consistent in all material
respects with or reflected in this Agreement or any representation or warranty
by Sellers hereunder (including, without limitation, in any Ancillary
Agreements) and (ii) no Seller Estoppel will be acceptable if it reflects any
fact or circumstance that is not consistent with or reflected in this
Agreement or any representation or warranty by Sellers hereunder (including,
without limitation, in any Ancillary Agreements) (each such fact or
circumstance described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), an
"Objectionable Disclosure") or if it reflects or discloses any actual material
uncured breach or default by any Seller under a Real Property Lease or Third
Party Lease that has not previously been disclosed to Buyers. To the extent a
Lease Estoppel or Seller Estoppel discloses an actual or alleged breach or
default by a Seller under a Real Property Lease or Third Party Lease, Sellers
shall commence to cure such matter, if and to the extent curable, not later
than delivery to Buyers of the applicable Lease Estoppel or Seller Estoppel,
and shall thereafter use commercially reasonable efforts to complete such cure
prior to the Closing. In the event Sellers fail to cure such breach or default
prior to the Closing as provided in the preceding sentence, and/or in the
event Buyers disapprove of any Objectionable Disclosure disclosed by any Lease
Estoppel or Seller Estoppel, then, at Buyers' option, exercisable by written
notice to Sellers prior to the consummation of the Closing, (A) the Purchase
Price will be reduced by an amount reasonably necessary to cure the applicable
breach or default, such amount to be mutually agreed upon in good faith by
Buyers and Sellers, or (B) Buyers may elect to proceed to the Closing without
a reduction of the Purchase Price and bring a claim for indemnification





pursuant to Section 8.2(i) for (1) the actual documented out-of-pocket Losses,
if any, suffered, sustained, incurred or required to be paid at any time from
and after the Closing by any Buyer Indemnified Party to the extent based upon,
arising out of, resulting from or because of such uncured breach or default,
plus (2) the Assigned Drop Value assigned to the applicable Station Property
on Schedule 2.7 in the event the applicable Real Property Lease or Third Party
Lease is terminated following the Closing primarily as a result of such
uncured breach or default.

Section 5.9 Inspections and Entry.

(a) Except as otherwise set forth herein, all inspections conducted by or on
behalf of Buyers shall be conducted at Buyers' sole expense by qualified
inspectors or contractors, selected by Buyer. Any entry upon any Real Property
(other than for environmental testing, which is governed by and subject to the
provisions of Section 5.6, and not this Section 5.9) by Buyers or any of
Buyers' Representatives, for the purpose of conducting such inspections shall
be upon not less than forty eight (48) hours' prior written notice to Sellers,
and shall be subject, in any event, to prior scheduling and coordination with
Sellers, and Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Buyers with respect to
such scheduling and coordination. At Sellers' election, a Representative of
Sellers shall be entitled to be present during any entry by Buyers or Buyers'
Representatives upon the Real Property to conduct the inspections. All
inspections shall be performed in a manner that will not materially disturb
ongoing operations of Sellers or any third party operators at the Station
Properties and Buyers shall as soon as reasonably practicable repair any
damage. Subject to Section 5.1(a), prior to the CIC Conversion Date for each
Station Property (or any termination of this Agreement), Buyers shall not
approach, contact or involve itself in any discussions or negotiations with
any employee of any Seller or with any other occupant of such Station
Property, without Sellers' prior written consent (which may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without Sellers (or
Sellers' designated representative) being present thereat. Prior to Buyers or
their Representatives accessing any Real Property and conducting tests
thereon, Buyers shall provide Sellers with a certificate of insurance naming
the applicable Seller as an additional insured and evidencing liability
coverage in form and substance acceptable to Sellers in an amount not less
than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) and an aggregate limit of at least Five
Million Dollars ($5,000,000).

(b) No more than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing, Buyers may enter the
Station Properties to install internet/telephone lines and other equipment
needed to effect an orderly post-Closing transition of the operations
conducted thereon. Such entry and installation shall be: (i) at Buyers' sole
risk and expense; and (ii) at such times as selected by Buyers and reasonably
approved by Sellers. Buyers' right to install other equipment under this
Section 5.9(b) shall be subject to prior written notice to Sellers. Buyers
shall not materially disturb the existing operations on the Station Properties
and shall keep the Station Properties free from any Liens or claims arising
out of any work performed, materials furnished, or obligations incurred by or
on behalf of Buyers. If any mechanic's or other Lien is recorded against such
Station Properties as a result of Buyers' installation of equipment and the
Closing does not occur, Buyers shall cause the Lien to be discharged of record
within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of such Lien's recording.







(c) If the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated for any
reason, and Buyers have installed equipment on the Station Properties in
accordance with Section 5.9(b), Buyers shall upon twenty (20) days' written
notice from Sellers remove the equipment installed by Buyers and restore the
Station Properties to materially the condition existing immediately prior to
Buyers installation of such equipment; provided, that, if after good faith
efforts, Buyers need more time to complete such activities, the Parties shall
cooperate to provide Buyers with a reasonable extension of time; provided,
further, that if Buyers fail to comply with the foregoing requirements, Buyers
shall be deemed to have transferred title to any equipment installed by Buyers
to the Seller that owns the applicable Station Property, at no cost and
without any express or implied warranty, after which such Seller shall be
solely responsible for such equipment. In completing any activities under this
Section 5.9(c), Buyers shall not materially disrupt the existing operations on
the Station Properties and shall assume all risks involved in entering the
Station Properties in connection therewith.

Section 5.10 De-Identification/Removal of Excluded Assets. With respect to
each Station Property, on or prior to the applicable CIC Conversion Date,
Sellers shall (a) remove all Excluded Assets (other than those Excluded Assets
owned by third Persons) from the Real Property no more than five (5) days
prior to the applicable CIC Conversion Date, as well as signs, signage or
advertising bearing or displaying Excluded Assets or any names, marks, trade
dress or other Intellectual Property rights, except, in each case, to the
extent required to continue ongoing operations of such Real Property in the
Ordinary Course of Business (which Excluded Assets shall be removed on the
applicable CIC Conversion Date), (b) de-brand each Station Property in
accordance with all requirements under Sellers' or their Affiliate's fuel
supply agreement with Valero Energy Corp. (the "Valero Supply Agreement") such
that nothing in the Valero Supply Agreement shall restrict either Buyers'
ability to sell motor fuels under any brand that Buyers so choose, and in
connection with such de-branding, Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with
Buyers to coordinate the de-branding and Buyers' branding so as to minimize
disruption to the fuel business at such Station Property, and/or (c)
permanently and completely paint over, hide, cover up, conceal and/or remove
all trade dress, as applicable (including but not limited to paint, paint
colors, vinyl, schemes or designs commonly used by Station Property to brand,
decorate and/or identify its stores), canopy vinyl, striping or designs,
advertising, names, marks and/or other Intellectual Property rights (including
the "Valero" name and other Intellectual Property rights associated with
Valero Energy Corp. and its Affiliates), whether inside buildings, outside
buildings, or on or in car washes; provided, however, that Sellers shall not
paint over, hide, cover up, conceal and/or remove any signs, signage or
advertising bearing or displaying any names, marks, trade dress or other
Intellectual Property rights owned by Sellers that any Buyer licenses
following such CIC Conversion Date. Sellers shall provide to Buyers, prior to
the applicable CIC Conversion Date, evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyers
that all Excluded Assets have been removed and the de-identification of all
Excluded Assets has occurred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, after good
faith efforts, Sellers need more time to comply with the foregoing, the
Parties shall cooperate to provide Sellers with a reasonable extension of
time.

Section 5.11 Permits. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at
their sole cost and expense, to transfer to any Buyer or its nominee or
designee on the applicable CIC Conversion Date the Permits included in the
Assets, transferable under applicable Law, and





necessary for the operation of the Business. Buyers shall reasonably cooperate
with all of Sellers' actions in connection therewith. With respect to any
Permits that are not transferable under applicable Law or cannot be
transferred to the applicable Buyer on or prior to the applicable CIC
Conversion Date despite commercially reasonable efforts having been
undertaken, such Buyer shall be responsible for obtaining such Permits and
Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with all of such Buyer's actions in
connection therewith, including by executing all documents or applications
required for such Permits and any interim management or other agreements
permitted by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
each Party shall be responsible for the costs, fees and expenses incurred
thereby in connection with the foregoing.

Section 5.12 Consents and Lease Amendments.

(a) Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain at the
earliest practicable date and, in any event, prior to the Closing, all
consents required with respect to the transfer of the Assumed Contracts (other
than the Lease Consents, which are addressed in Section 5.8) (the "Contract
Consents"). In connection therewith, Sellers shall make any payment required
by any applicable Assumed Contract by its express terms and any other payment
reasonably required by Buyers or any other party to the applicable Assumed
Contract to obtain the Contract Consents. Each Contract Consent shall be in a
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyers. Buyers shall reasonably
cooperate with Sellers in obtaining the Contract Consents; provided, however,
that Buyers shall not be required to make any payments to any Person or make
any other economic concessions to permit Sellers to obtain any Consents.

(b) Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain at the
earliest practicable date and, in any event, prior to the Closing, amendments
to each of the Third Party Leases and Real Property Leases listed on Schedule
5.12(b)-2 adding the lease term renewal options and other amendments specified
on Schedule 5.12(b)-2 (collectively, the "Lease Amendments"); provided,
however, that Sellers shall not be required to make any payments to any Person
or make any other economic concession to permit Buyers to obtain any Lease
Amendments other than the amendments adding the lease term renewal options
specified on Schedule 5.12(b)-2; provided, further, that to the extent that
Sellers are unable to obtain any Lease Consent, Contract Consent or Lease
Amendment prior to the Closing, Sellers shall continue to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such Lease Consent, Contract Consent or Lease
Amendment following the Closing.

(c) The failure of Sellers to obtain any Lease Consents, Contract Consents or
Lease Amendments prior to the Closing shall not, in and of itself, be deemed a
breach of this Agreement, including for purposes of ARTICLE VII and ARTICLE X.
For the avoidance of doubt, neither this Agreement nor the applicable
Assignment and Assumption Agreement shall constitute a sale, assignment,
assumption, transfer, conveyance or delivery or an attempted sale, assignment,
assumption, transfer, conveyance or delivery of the Assumed Contract to which
such Lease Consent, Contract Consent or Lease Amendment relates if such Lease
Consent, Contract Consent or Lease Amendment has not been obtained prior to
the Closing, and following the Closing the Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts and cooperate with each other to obtain such Lease Consent,
Contract Consent or such Lease Amendment as soon as practicable; provided,
however, that Buyers shall not be required to make any payments to any Person
or make any other economic concession





to permit Sellers to obtain any Lease Consent or Contract Consent, and Sellers
shall not be required to make to make any payments to any Person or make any
other economic concession to permit Buyers to obtain any Lease Amendment other
than the amendments adding the lease term renewal options specified on
Schedule 5.12(b)-2. Upon obtaining such Lease Consent, Contract Consent or
Lease Amendment following the Closing, each Seller who is a party to the
applicable Assumed Contract shall promptly assign, transfer, convey and
deliver such Assumed Contract to the applicable Buyer and such Buyer shall
assume the obligations under such Assumed Contract, from and after the date of
assignment to such Buyer, pursuant to a special purpose assignment and
assumption agreement substantially similar in terms to those of the applicable
Assignment and Assumption Agreement (which special-purpose agreement the
Parties shall prepare, execute and deliver in good faith at the time of such
transfer).

(d) To the extent that Sellers are unable to obtain any Lease Consent,
Contract Consent or any Lease Amendment and the Closing occurs, (i) the
applicable Seller shall continue to be bound by the obligations arising under
the terms and conditions of the Assumed Contract to which such Lease Consent,
Contract Consent or Lease Amendment relates (a "Non-Transferred Contract"),
(ii) with respect to any Non-Transferred Contract relating to a Third Party
Lease or Real Property Lease, the applicable Seller shall enter into a
management agreement or similar contractual arrangement with the applicable
Buyer under which such Buyer shall (A) assume management of the operation of
the Station Property to which such Non-Transferred Contract relates on behalf
of such Seller, (B) act as such Seller's agent to perform all of such Seller's
obligations under such Non-Transferred Contract, including the obligation to
pay any costs, expenses and charges reasonably incurred by Sellers, such as
labor, rent and similar charges, in accordance with the terms of such Non-
Transferred Contract, and (C) receive the benefits of such Non-Transferred
Contract and operation of the Station Property, including all proceeds or
other compensation received by such Seller pursuant to such Non-Transferred
Contract or in connection with the operation of the Station Property and
attributable to such Buyer's performance of such Non-Transferred Contract and
operation of the Station Property in the post-Closing period, (D) with respect
to any Non-Transferred Contract relating to an Assumed Contract, at Buyers'
request, Sellers shall cooperate with Buyers to establish a reasonable
arrangement designed to provide such Buyer with the benefits and burdens of
such Non-Transferred Contract, including appointing such Buyer to act as its
agent to perform all of the applicable Seller's obligations under such Non-
Transferred Contract and to collect and promptly remit to such Buyer all
compensation received by any Seller pursuant to such Non-Transferred Contract
and attributable to such Buyer's performance of such Non-Transferred Contract
in the post-Closing period, (E) unless directed by a Buyer, no Seller shall
take any action that would reasonably be expected to lead to a breach of the
terms and conditions of such Non-Transferred Contract, and (F) the applicable
Seller shall seek to enforce, at the direction of such Buyer, and for the
account and benefit of such Buyer, any and all rights of such Seller against
any other Person arising out of the breach or cancellation of such Non-
Transferred Contract by such other Person or otherwise (any and all of which
arrangements shall constitute, as between the Parties, a deemed assignment or
transfer); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not obligate any Seller
to commence or participate in any material Proceeding relating to the
enforcement of such Non-Transferred Contracts absent an undertaking by Buyers,
reasonably acceptable to Sellers, to (x) reimburse Sellers for all fees, costs
and expenses related to such actions and (y) indemnify and hold





harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses
relating to or arising from such actions.

Section 5.13 Termination of Contracts Other Than Assumed Contracts. Sellers
shall terminate, at least effective as of the Closing, all Contracts effective
at or prior to the Closing with respect to their application to the applicable
Station Properties which are not Assumed Contracts (except with respect to
Contracts that are necessary for the continued operation of a Station Property
in the Ordinary Course of Business, which Contracts shall be terminated with
respect to such Station Property on the applicable CIC Conversion Date), and
Sellers shall provide to Buyers evidence satisfactory to Buyers of the
termination of all such Contracts on or prior to, as applicable, the Closing
or the applicable CIC Conversion Date (to be effective in accordance with the
foregoing).

Section 5.14 ADA Settlement Agreement. Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, at Sellers' sole cost and expense, to complete, or cause
to be completed, all modifications and accommodations to, or renovations and
remodeling of, the Station Property currently known as Corner Store #3074 and
located at 3225 Buck Owens Boulevard, Bakersfield, California that are
required to carry out, perform, satisfy and discharge in full CST CA's
obligations under the ADA Settlement Agreement, including the modifications
and accommodations to, or renovations and remodeling of such Station Property
described in Schedule 5.14. In the event that such work is not completed by
the applicable CIC Conversion Date, Sellers shall complete, or cause to be
completed, such work following such CIC Conversion Date pursuant to an access
agreement in a form mutually agreeable to the Parties. Sellers shall complete,
or cause to be completed, such work in accordance with Schedule 5.14 at
Sellers' sole cost and expense and shall deliver to Buyers evidence thereof
promptly after such completion.

Section 5.15 Station Property #4545 Remodel. Sellers shall complete, or cause
to be completed, at Sellers' sole cost and expense, all renovations and
remodeling of the Station Property currently known as Corner Store #4545 and
located at 3306 West College Drive, Cheyenne, Wyoming 82007 in accordance with
Schedule 5.15. Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Buyers on any changes
that Buyers may request to Schedule 5.15, provided that such changes do not
cause any incremental cost and expense to be incurred by Sellers, and the
Parties shall update Schedule 5.15 to reflect any such changes. In the event
that such work is not completed by the applicable CIC Conversion Date, Sellers
shall complete, or cause to be completed, such work following such CIC
Conversion Date pursuant to an access agreement in a form mutually agreeable
to the Parties. Sellers shall complete, or cause to be completed, such work in
accordance with Schedule 5.15 at Sellers' sole cost and expense and shall
deliver to Buyers evidence thereof promptly after such completion.

Section 5.16 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation. The restrictive covenants

Assets, the Business and other interests and rights being acquired by Buyers
under this Agreement as well as the other legitimate business interests of

ARTICLE VI 
ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

Section 6.1 Remediation of Retained Contamination.

(a) With respect to each Station Property with Retained Contamination (each, a
"Remediation Site"), Sellers shall in a prompt manner undertake at their sole
cost and expense those Remediation Activities necessary to achieve NFA Status
at such Remediation Site. Remediation Activities may be undertaken prior to or
following the Closing, at Sellers' election, and the completion of such
Remediation Activities to NFA Status shall not be a condition to the Closing.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that Sellers shall administer the
Remediation Activities that Sellers are obligated to perform pursuant to this
Section 6.1 and, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including
ARTICLE VIII), so long as Sellers are promptly and diligently conducting such
Remediation Activities, then Sellers shall be responsible for those costs and
expenses incurred by Sellers and their respective agents, consultants, and
contractors. Buyers shall cooperate with Sellers as may be required for
Sellers to achieve NFA Status at each affected Station Property, including (i)
consenting to, and complying with, any Engineering and Institutional Controls
deemed by Sellers necessary therefor, and which do not interfere in any
material respect with Buyers' actual or expected operations at the Station
Property, and (ii) executing any documentation required by the applicable
Governmental Entities relating thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers
shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to achieve NFA Status in a
manner which minimizes the need for Engineering and Institutional Controls and
Sellers shall maintain compliance with all Engineering and Institutional
Controls, including but not limited to, consent orders, administrative orders
and similar documents. Following the Closing, Buyers shall provide Sellers
with reasonable access to the affected Station Properties in order to perform
any required Remediation Activities and, at the Closing, shall execute and
deliver to Sellers a Site Access Agreement in the form mutually agreeable to
the Parties (the "Site Access Agreement") for each such Station Property. Upon
achieving NFA Status with respect to Retained Contamination at a particular
Station Property, Buyers and the other Buyer-Related Parties shall
automatically be deemed to have released and





discharged Sellers and the other Seller-Related Parties from any future
liability or obligations which arise out of or relate to Contamination at such
Station Property, other than Sellers' obligations under ARTICLE VIII, and (at
Sellers' request) Buyers shall deliver a written instrument evidencing such
release to Sellers. Sellers' obligations under this Agreement with respect to
Remediation Activities shall be discharged upon a change in ownership of a
Station Property unless within five (5) days of such change in ownership, all
subsequent owners of such Station Property give notice to Sellers of such
change in ownership and of their agreement to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement.

(b) Remediation Activities for a Remediation Site shall be deemed completed
for purposes of this Agreement upon achieving NFA Status. Sellers shall
promptly notify Buyers of a Remediation Site achieving such status, but such
notice shall not affect or diminish Sellers' obligations under ARTICLE VIII.
All Remediation Activities shall be completed by Sellers in a good and
workmanlike manner with due diligence, in compliance with applicable Laws and
shall be undertaken in such a manner so as not to interfere in any material
respect with Buyers' or their franchisees', commissioned marketers',
consignees' or other third parties' actual or expected operations at the
respective Station Property, and Sellers shall ensure proper closure of any
groundwater or other monitoring wells, removal of all metal rings, and
restoration of the condition of each Remediation Site to its condition prior
to the initiation of Remediation Activities, to the extent reasonably
practicable.

(c) If Buyers plan to undertake any development or redevelopment of any
Remediation Site during which time Sellers are conducting Remediation
Activities as required under the terms of this Agreement, Buyers shall provide
notice to Sellers of all plans and proposals related to such development or
redevelopment. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
coordinate Buyers' development or redevelopment plans with Sellers'
Remediation Activities. Buyers shall be responsible solely for the incremental
increase in the cost of Remediation Activities attributable to Buyers'
development or redevelopment plans. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that Sellers shall have no liability or responsibility
for any Losses incurred by Buyers related to Buyers' development or
development of any of the Station Properties (including any UST System repair
or replacement other than Fuel Equipment Repairs for which Sellers are
responsible pursuant to Section 5.6(b)) on or after the Closing Date. By way
of example only, Sellers shall not be responsible for the cost of the
transport and disposal of any soil excavated or removed during Buyers'
development of a Station Property or the cost of any collection, treatment,
transport, disposal or discharge of any groundwater during Buyers' development
of a Station Property except for any costs of such activities directly related
to the presence of Retained Contamination in the soil or groundwater for which
Sellers would be responsible for the collection, treatment, transport or
disposal of absent Buyers' development or redevelopment.

(d) Buyers acknowledge and agree that Sellers may be eligible for
reimbursement or other funding assistance in connection with certain of the
Remediation Activities from a Governmental Entity ("Government Funding").
Buyers shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers in order for Sellers to obtain
any applicable Government Funding relating to a Station Property, including
providing to Sellers any information, forms or certificates reasonably
requested by Sellers and not confidential to Buyers, and Buyers shall assign
to Sellers all rights to any





Government Funding proceeds received or receivable by Buyers to the extent
such proceeds solely relate to the Remediation Activities performed by
Sellers.

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
be construed as an admission regarding any responsibility, wrongdoing,
liability or damages by Sellers with respect to the Retained Contamination or
otherwise. Accordingly, each Seller reserves its right to pursue any claims
for damages, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, indemnity and contribution
that it may have against third parties, and nothing contained in this
Agreement shall alter or in any way affect any right any Seller may have
against any third parties or any defenses any Seller may have to any claims by
any third-parties.

(f) The Parties acknowledge that, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Station Properties are being sold to Buyers with USTs in place
and accordingly agree as follows:

(i) Sellers shall provide all relevant and necessary information about the
USTs, including, without limitation, information regarding the age and
condition of the USTs, all prior reported incidents involving the USTs (if
any) and all information regarding registration of the USTs with appropriate
authorities. Such information has been or will be provided solely for Buyers'
use and may not be relied upon by any third party.

(ii) In accordance with applicable Laws, Buyers shall obtain all Permits that
are required by any applicable Governmental Entity or standards (including all
Environmental Laws) to own and operate all USTs at the Station Properties.
Buyers and Sellers shall cooperate and take all commercially reasonable steps
to ensure that the records of the applicable Governmental Entities show the
applicable Buyer as the owner and operator of the USTs from and after the
Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing, to the extent possible, Sellers and
Buyers each covenant to deliver prior to the Closing all necessary tank
registration forms and other documentation required by applicable Governmental
Entities to transfer ownership of the USTs to the applicable Buyer (the "Tank
Owner Change Forms") as of the Closing Date.

(g) Prior to the Closing, the Parties shall update Schedule 1.1(vi) to include
any additional exclusions and endorsements to the Environmental Insurance
Policy that are identified between the Effective Date and the date of binding
of the Environmental Insurance Policy that are reasonably agreed to by Buyers.

(h) Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Buyers in order for Buyers to
obtain any Government Funding or other insurance funds relating to any Assumed
Environmental Liabilities, including providing Buyers any information, forms
or certificates reasonably requested by Buyers.

Section 6.2 Pre-Closing and Post-Closing Releases. If, at any time after the
Closing, during the performance of the Remediation Activities at a Station
Property, a Buyer or a Seller (in connection with Sellers' performance of
Remediation Activities) has reason to believe





that a pre-Closing Release has been discovered (other than a pre-Closing
Release that is Retained Contamination) or that a post-Closing Release has
occurred, such Party shall notify the other Parties immediately. With respect
to a post-Closing Release, if a Seller or its agents or contractors were
responsible for the Release as part of Post-Closing Activities, Sellers shall
take those steps reasonably required, in consultation with Buyers, or as
required by the relevant Governmental Entity, to determine and abate the
source of the Release. If the Release was not caused by a Seller or its agents
or contractors or the Release occurred prior to Closing (other than a pre-
Closing Release that is Retained Contamination), then Buyers shall take those
steps reasonably required, or as required by the relevant Governmental Entity,
to determine and abate the source of the Release. Sellers and Buyers shall
agree on an allocation of responsibility for tests undertaken and for the
remediation expenses from that date forward based on the responsibility for
the Release pursuant to this Agreement. Unless otherwise mandated by the
relevant Governmental Entity, no Release shall affect a Seller's status as
responsible party for purposes of performing the Remediation Activities with
respect to any Retained Contamination (except as provided in Section 6.1) or
effect or diminish Sellers' obligations under ARTICLE VIII. Except as provided
in Section 5.6(b), Sellers shall not be responsible for any Release unless
such Release is Retained Contamination or the Release occurred post-Closing
and was caused by Sellers or their agents or contractors.

Section 6.3 Tax Matters.

(a) Transfer Taxes. Regardless of which Party is liable for such Taxes under
applicable Law, Sellers shall pay and be responsible for (or, if any Buyer is
required by applicable Law to pay, then Sellers shall promptly reimburse such
Buyer for) all sales Tax, use Tax, real property transfer Tax, grantor or
grantee Tax, documentary stamp Tax, transfer Tax, motor vehicle Tax,
registration Tax or similar Tax or recording expense or notarial fee
attributable to, imposed upon or arising from the transactions contemplated
hereby ("Transfer Taxes"). Sellers shall file all Tax Returns with respect to
such Taxes, and Buyers shall provide commercially reasonable assistance in
connection with such filings.

(b) Proration of Taxes and Other Items.

(i) Annual personal property Taxes, real property Taxes, charges for
utilities, and other periodic charges relating to the Assets shall be pro-
rated as of the Effective Time, with Sellers liable to the extent such items
relate to any time period (or portion thereof) up to and including the Closing
Date ("Pre-Closing Charges") and Buyers liable to the extent such items relate
to periods (or any portion thereof) subsequent to the Closing Date. Because
such Taxes and other charges involve a period that begins before and ends
after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the Pre-Closing Charges shall be
calculated by multiplying the amount of such Taxes and other charges for the
entire Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days in the Straddle Period from the first day of the Straddle Period through
and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the entire Straddle Period. Sellers shall furnish Buyers with such
documents and other records as Buyers request to confirm such proration and
other calculations. Any amounts owed by Sellers pursuant to this Section
6.3(b) shall be





collected by the Title Company at the Closing and paid by the Title Company at
the Closing.

(ii) On or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the Closing Date, Sellers
and Buyers shall recalculate the adjustments and prorations provided for in
Section 6.3(b)(i) (the "Interim Closing Adjustment") and the Party receiving
the benefit of the recalculation shall receive a payment in immediately
available funds from the other Part(y)(ies) within ten (10) Business Days
after the Interim Closing Adjustment is finalized.

(iii) On or before the ninetieth (90th) day following the Closing Date,
Sellers and Buyers shall make a final adjustment to the prorations made at the
Closing Date, as adjusted by the Interim Closing Adjustment (the "Final
Closing Adjustment"). The Final Closing Adjustment shall be made in the
following manner:

(A) All adjustments or prorations which could not be determined on the Closing
Date or the Interim Closing Adjustment because of the lack of actual
statements, bills or invoices for the current period or any other reason shall
be made as a part of the Final Closing Adjustment. Any net adjustment in favor
of any Buyer shall be paid by Sellers by wire transfer of immediately
available federal funds to such Buyer no later than ten (10) days after the
Final Closing Adjustment. Any net adjustment in favor of any Seller shall be
paid (in immediately available federal funds) by Buyers to such Seller no
later than ten (10) Business Days after the Final Closing Adjustment.

(B) The Final Closing Adjustment shall be conclusive, final and binding on
Sellers and Buyers in all respects and, absent fraud or manifest error,
Sellers and Buyers hereby waive any right to contest after the Final Closing
Adjustment any prorations or adjustments to be made pursuant to this Section
6.3(b).

(C) Sellers and Buyers shall make available to each other upon request their
respective records regarding all items of income and expense relating to the
period of their ownership to the extent necessary to make the Interim Closing
Adjustment and the Final Closing Adjustment. Without limiting the foregoing,
Sellers shall provide Buyers with all back up information necessary to
determine the actual Pre-Closing Charges incurred by Sellers in calendar year
2016 through and including the Closing Date.

(c) Tax Audits. Buyers shall promptly notify Sellers in writing upon the
receipt by any Buyer or any of its Affiliates of notice of any pending or
threatened Tax liabilities which relate to any period or portion thereof
ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Sellers shall have the sole right to
control any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding with respect to
Taxes for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and Buyers agree
that it shall reasonably cooperate, at Sellers' expense, with Sellers and
their counsel in defense against or compromise of any claim in any such
proceeding; provided, however, that Buyers shall have the right (not to be
unreasonably





withheld, conditioned or delayed) to approve any settlement or other
resolution of such proceeding where such settlement or other resolution will
have adverse Tax consequences on any Buyer with respect to its ownership of
the Assets or its operation of the Business with respect to a taxable period
or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date. With respect to Straddle
Periods, Buyers shall have the sole right to control any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding with respect to such Taxes, and Sellers
agree that they shall reasonably cooperate, at Sellers' expense, with Buyers
and their counsel in defense against or compromise of any claim in any such
proceeding.

(d) Wage Reporting. Buyers and Sellers agree to utilize the standard procedure
set forth in Revenue Procedure 2004-53 with respect to wage reporting.

(e) Cooperation. After the Closing Date, Buyers and Sellers shall furnish or
cause to be furnished to each other, as promptly as practicable, and make
available to the other, as reasonably requested, and to any Governmental
Entity (which such Governmental Entity is legally permitted to receive
pursuant to its subpoena power or its equivalent) all information, records or
documents relating to Liabilities for Taxes or potential Liabilities for Taxes
of the Business for all periods prior to or including the Closing Date and
shall preserve all such information, records and documents until the
expiration of any applicable statute of limitations for assessment or refund
of Taxes or extensions thereof. Sellers shall prepare any Tax Returns for
periods ending on or before the Closing Date in accordance with past practices
of Sellers. Buyers shall prepare and provide to Sellers, at Sellers' expense,
such Tax information packages consistent with Sellers' past practice to the
extent practicable as Sellers shall reasonably request for use in preparing
any such Tax Return that relates to a period that ends on or prior to the
Closing. Such Tax information packages shall be completed by Buyers and
provided to Sellers as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event
within thirty (30) days after Buyers' receipt of Sellers' request therefor.
Buyers shall prepare all Tax Returns for all Straddle Periods in accordance
with past practices of Sellers. After the Closing Date, Buyers and Sellers
shall reasonably cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the
other, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation,
appeal, hearing, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
shall include providing the information, records, and documents described
above and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided. Except as
otherwise provided in this paragraph, each Party shall bear its own expenses
in complying with the foregoing provisions. Notwithstanding the provisions of
this Section 6.3(e), while the existence of an adversarial proceeding between
the Parties shall not abrogate or suspend the provisions of this Section
6.3(e), as to such records or other information directly pertinent to such
dispute, the Parties may not utilize this Section 6.3(e) but rather, absent
another express agreement, must utilize the rules of discovery.

(f) Bulk Transfer Laws. Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall fully comply
with, and be responsible for, the requirements and provisions of all
applicable bulk sale, bulk transfer or similar Laws in all applicable
jurisdictions in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.





Section 6.4 Employee Matters.

(a) Transferring Employees. Buyers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates, to
evaluate in good faith all employees of each Seller or its Affiliates employed
at the Station Properties that Buyers intend to operate as corporate stores,
to the extent known by Buyers on the Effective Date, with such stores
disclosed on Schedule 6.4 (the "Employees") for employment with the Business
after the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date, Buyers may deliver to
Sellers an updated Schedule 6.4 modifying the list of stores that Buyers
intend to operate as corporate stores. Buyers or their Affiliates may, at
their discretion, offer employment to the Employees effective on the Closing
Date or the applicable CIC Conversion Date, if later, on terms and conditions
set by Buyers or their Affiliates in their sole discretion. All of the
Employees who are offered, accept, and then commence employment with either
Buyer after the Closing Date are hereinafter collectively referred to as
"Transferring Employees" and each individually is referred to as a
"Transferring Employee." Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement shall, after the Closing, impose on any Buyer or any of its
Affiliates any obligation to retain any Transferring Employee in its
employment.

(b) Employee Benefits. Buyers shall take such action as may be necessary to
cause each Transferring Employee (i) to be credited under any employee benefit
plan of Buyers or their Affiliates under which the Transferring Employee
becomes covered for his or her period of employment with Sellers and their
Affiliates and predecessors before the Closing or the applicable CIC
Conversion Date, if later, as if the Transferring Employee were so employed by
the applicable Buyer for all purposes for which such service was recognized by
Sellers and the Business or their respective Affiliates and predecessors,
except for service for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit plan
of Buyers and except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication
of benefits, or to the extent not provided under a corresponding Benefit Plan;
(ii) to be eligible to participate in all employee benefit plans maintained by
Buyers and generally available to employees of Buyers on the same terms and
conditions as employees of Buyers as of the Closing Date, without waiting
periods or exclusions or limitations for pre-existing conditions, to the
extent allowed by Buyers' specific benefit plan without an amendment or other
change/revision to such plans; and (iii) along with his or her eligible
dependents, as applicable, to be credited under any welfare benefit plan
maintained by Buyers and covering such Transferring Employee after the Closing
for any deductible or coinsurance amounts paid by such Transferring Employee
(or his or her eligible dependents) under any corresponding Benefit Plan
during the plan year which includes the Closing Date.

(c) Communications to Employees. As promptly as reasonably possible following
the date hereof, Buyers and Sellers shall jointly prepare, mutually approve
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and
make a coordinated initial written communication to the employees of Sellers
or their Affiliates engaged in the Business announcing this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to making any subsequent
written communications after the initial communication contemplated by the
immediately preceding sentence to the employees of Sellers or their Affiliates
engaged in the Business, pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, their employment, termination, compensation,
benefits, or other terms and conditions of employment that are affected by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Sellers shall provide Buyers





with a copy of the intended communication (at least 24 hours prior to making
such communication) and shall entertain, in good faith, any comments Buyers
may have on such communication if received at least two hours prior to the
making of such communication, provided that 24 hours prior notice and prior
approval by Buyers shall not be required in respect of any such subsequent
communications to the extent that the substance and content of such
communications are consistent in all material respects with the initial joint
written communication or any subsequent communications approved by Buyers (any
such prior approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, no responses to
questions of Sellers' employees on the employee portal, or any communications
required to comply with the WARN act or any other applicable Law shall be
required to be provided to Buyer to the extent that the substance and content
of such responses are consistent in all material respects with communications
previously approved by Buyers. Sellers shall not make any oral communications
to any employees of Sellers or their Affiliates engaged in the Business that
is materially inconsistent with the substance and content of any written
communications previously approved by Buyers. Buyers shall notify Sellers
which employees of Sellers or its Affiliates it intends to make offers of
employment to prior to the Closing. Buyers shall be entitled to meet with and
interview Sellers' employees in accordance with Section 5.1 in connection with
potential offers of employment as described in this Section 6.4 or other
matters described in Section 5.1; provided, however, that Buyers shall not
approach, contact or involve itself in any discussions or negotiations with
any employee of any Seller or with any other occupant of such Station
Property, without Sellers' prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and, at Sellers' option,
without Sellers (or Sellers' designated representative) being present thereat.

(d) Benefit Plans. Buyers shall not assume any Liabilities or responsibilities
relating to any Benefit Plan or to the Benefit Plans generally, and Sellers
shall remain fully liable and responsible for all liabilities, costs and
expenses relating to all such Benefit Plans.

(e) COBRA. Sellers acknowledge and agree that the "Selling Group" (as such
term is defined in Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-3 of the Treasury Regulations)
shall be solely liable, and that neither Buyer shall have any obligation or
liability, for providing continuation coverage under and complying with COBRA
with respect to any individual who prior to the Closing was covered under any
Benefit Plan that constitutes a group health plan contributed to or maintained
by any member of the Selling Group and who will be an "MandA Qualified
Beneficiary" (as such phrase is defined in Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-4 of the
Treasury Regulations) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and who is not a Transferring Employee or dependent thereof (the
"Seller COBRA Beneficiaries"). Each Seller agrees to cause the Selling Group
to provide continuing health benefit coverage as required under COBRA ("COBRA
Coverage") to all Employees, other than Transferring Employees, who are MandA
Qualified Beneficiaries with respect to the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement. Buyers acknowledge and agree that Buyers shall be solely liable,
and that neither Seller nor any of their Affiliates shall have any obligation
or liability, for providing continuation coverage under and complying with
COBRA with respect to any Transferring Employee (or any dependent thereof who
is not an MandA Qualified Beneficiary prior to the Closing) whose "qualifying
event" (as defined under COBRA) occurs after the Closing. If Sellers'
obligation to provide COBRA Coverage to the Seller COBRA Beneficiaries shifts
to either Buyer pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-8





(b) or (c), then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Sellers shall reimburse such Buyer for any and all documented costs
and expenses that such Buyer reasonably incurs in providing COBRA Coverage to
Seller COBRA Beneficiaries (including, but not limited to, claims,
administrative costs, fees and insurance premiums); provided that in no event
will Sellers have any Liability to Buyers with respect to any costs or
expenses incurred in providing COBRA Coverage to any Transferring Employee (or
any dependent thereof who is not an MandA Qualified Beneficiary prior to the
Closing). Buyers shall invoice Sellers monthly with respect to such costs and
expenses, together with documentation showing such costs and expenses have
been incurred, and Sellers shall be obligated to make full payment of each
such invoice within thirty (30) Business Days of the date of such invoice and,
if Sellers shall fail to timely pay the amounts of such invoices, Sellers
shall also be obligated to pay interest with respect to the unpaid amounts at
the rate of five percent (5%) per annum. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
in this Section 6.4(e) shall relieve any Party of any obligation or liability
such Party may have under applicable Law for providing continuation coverage
under and complying with COBRA with respect to any Transferring Employee (or
any dependent thereof who is not an MandA Qualified Beneficiary prior to the
Closing) nor shall it require any Party to be responsible for any such
obligation or liability of any other Party.

(f) WARN Act. To the extent any terminations of employment by Sellers or their
Affiliates of any Employees before the Effective Time constitute a "plant
closing" or "mass layoff" within the meaning of the WARN Act, Sellers shall be
responsible for and comply with all the requirements of the WARN Act.

(g) No Third Party Beneficiaries. No provision of this Section 6.4 shall (i)
create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any Employee or former
employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of Sellers or their
Affiliates in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) with
Buyers or their Affiliates or create any such rights in any such Persons in
respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under
any employee benefit plan that may exist or be established by any Buyer or any
of its Affiliates; (ii) be construed as an amendment to any employee benefit
plan; or (iii) constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify or terminate
after the Closing Date any employee benefit plan of any Buyer or any of its
Affiliates.

Section 6.5 Post-Closing Access to Information and Confidentiality.

(a) For a period of seven (7) years from and after the Closing Date, Sellers
and Buyers shall provide each other, and shall cause their respective
appropriate Representatives to provide, when reasonably requested to do so by
the other Party (and at the requesting Parties' sole cost and expense), access
to all Tax, financial, accounting or other records of or relating to the
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, or the Business (x) permitted to be retained
by Sellers under this Agreement, in the case of Sellers, or (y) in respect of
any Straddle Period, and the right to make copies or extracts therefrom at its
expense. During such seven (7) year period, none of the Parties shall, nor
shall they permit their Affiliates or Representatives to, intentionally
dispose of, alter or destroy any such books, records and other data without
giving at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the other Party and
permitting such other Party, at its sole cost and expense, to examine,
duplicate or repossess such records, files, documents and correspondence.





(b) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, each Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to hold, in
confidence any and all proprietary information and data, whether written or
oral, relating to Buyers, the Business, the Assets, this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including any information and data treated as confidential information under
the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is acknowledged and agreed that each Seller may disclose such
information or data to (i) its Representatives, so long as any such
Representatives to whom disclosure is made need to know such information for a
legitimate business purpose and also agree to keep all such information
confidential in accordance with the terms hereof and (ii) any Governmental
Entities, but only to the extent required by an applicable Law, provided that
in such event such Seller will provide as much prior notice as possible of
such disclosure to Buyers, exercise all commercially reasonable efforts to
preserve the confidentiality of the confidential information, including,
without limitation, reasonably cooperating with Buyers (at Buyers' sole
expense) to obtain an appropriate order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded such information or data by such
Governmental Entity and will disclose only that portion of the confidential
information that such Seller is legally required to disclose. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the confidentiality provisions of this Section 6.5(b) shall not
apply to any information or data that has been, is or will be (x) generally
available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure in violation of
this Agreement, (y) available to Sellers or their Representatives on a non-
confidential basis from a Person who is not known, after reasonable inquiry,
to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with Buyers or (z) is independently
developed by Sellers or their Representatives without use of or reference to
the proprietary information.

Section 6.6 Casualty.

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in Section 6.7, Sellers shall bear the risk
of condemnation and the risk of loss, damage or destruction of the Real
Property by fire, lighting storm, windstorm, hail, explosion, flooding,
hurricane, earthquake, landslide, subversion, theft, act of God, act of
terrorism or other similar casualty event ("Casualty") prior to the Closing.

(b) If any Real Property is damaged by a Casualty prior to the Closing (each,
a "Casualty Event"), (i) as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within
48 hours of being on notice of the occurrence thereof), Sellers shall notify
Buyers of such Casualty Event in writing, which such notice shall specify the
applicable Real Property, the loss or damage incurred in the Casualty Event,
and the cause thereof, in each case, to the extent then known, and (ii) as
promptly as practicable, Sellers shall provide Buyers with (A) any information
in clause (i) that was not known when the foregoing notice was given and (B) a
good faith estimate of the cost to repair such damage on the particular Real
Property (to the extent, in the case of Leased Real Property, that a Seller is
obligated to perform any repairs under the applicable Real Property Lease);
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
failure of Sellers to give the foregoing notices to Buyers shall not
constitute a breach of this Agreement for the purposes of ARTICLE VII or
ARTICLE X if Sellers cure the Casualty prior to the Closing. With respect to
any Casualty Event, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

(i) subject to clause (iii) of this Section, if the estimated cost to repair
the damage to the Real Property in such Casualty Event is less than or equal
to the





lesser of ten percent (10%) of the Assigned Drop Value of such Real Property
or $250,000.00, then Sellers shall reimburse Buyers for the amount necessary
to complete the repairs to such Real Property as reflected in such estimate
(after taking into account any repairs actually undertaken by Sellers prior to
the Closing), and this transaction shall be closed as to such Real Property;
or

(ii) if the estimated cost to repair such damage to the Real Property in such
Casualty Event is in excess of the lesser of ten percent (10%) of the Assigned
Drop Value of such Real Property or $250,000.00 and Seller cannot, or elects
not to, restore the applicable Station Property to a state in which the
Business can be carried out thereat following the applicable CIC Conversion
Date in a manner consistent with past practice, Buyers shall have the option,
in their discretion, to either (A) treat the Real Property as a Rejected
Property and reduce the Purchase Price by the Assigned Drop Value assigned to
such Real Property on Schedule 2.7, or (B) require Sellers to reimburse Buyers
for the amount necessary to repair such damage as reflected in the estimate
provided above with respect to such Casualty Event (after taking into account
any repairs actually undertaken by Sellers prior to the Closing) and this
transaction shall be closed as to such Real Property and Sellers shall be
entitled to retain any insurance proceeds paid as a result of such Casualty
Event under Seller's casualty policy;

(iii) if the Casualty impacts a Leased Real Property and the applicable
landlord has the right to terminate the applicable Real Property Lease as a
result thereof (and such right has not been waived and the time period, if
any, for exercising such right has not expired and does not expire prior to
the Closing), then Buyers shall have the option, in their discretion, to treat
such Real Property as a Rejected Property and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Assigned Drop Value assigned to such Real Property; or

(iv) if the Casualty impacts a Leased Real Property and the applicable
landlord validly exercises a right to terminate the applicable Real Property
Lease as a result thereof, then such Real Property shall be deemed a Rejected
Property and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Assigned Drop Value
assigned to such Real Property.

Section 6.7 Condemnation. If, before the Closing, except as set forth on
Schedule 6.7, a part of the Real Property is taken, or noticed or threatened
for taking, by eminent domain (each, a "Condemnation Action"), Sellers shall
give Buyers written notice thereof as promptly as practicable (and, in any
event, within 48 hours of the occurrence thereof). If such Condemnation Action
would reasonably be expected to have a permanent and material and adverse
effect on the Real Property or the Business at such Real Property (each, a
"Total Condemnation Action"), then Buyers shall have the option, in their sole
discretion, to (a) treat such Real Property as a Rejected Property and reduce
the Purchase Price by the Assigned Drop Value assigned to such Real Property
on Schedule 2.7 or (b) in consultation with Sellers, mutually agree on an
equitable reduction of the Purchase Price with respect to such Real Property,
taking into account, among other things, the probable amount of condemnation
proceeds to be received in connection with such Total





Condemnation Action, the party to whom such proceeds are to be paid, the cost
of restoring such Real Property, and the party obligated to make such
restoration. In the event of any Condemnation Action that is not a Total
Condemnation Action (each, a "Partial Condemnation Action"), then Buyers shall
have the option, in their sole discretion, to (i) in consultation with
Sellers, equitably reduce the Purchase Price with respect to the Real Property
subject to such Partial Condemnation Action (but in any event, by an amount
less than the applicable Assigned Drop Value), taking into account the
probable amount of condemnation proceeds to be received in connection with
such Partial Condemnation Action, the party to whom such proceeds are to be
paid, the cost of restoring such Real Property, and the party obligated to
make such restoration, or (ii) require Sellers to (A) pay to Buyers on the CIC
Conversion Date any proceeds (except for reimbursement of costs actually
incurred by Sellers prior to the applicable CIC Conversion Date) actually
received by Sellers at or prior to the applicable CIC Conversion Date as a
result of the respective Condemnation and (B) assign to Buyers the right to
receive any future proceeds received in respect of such Condemnation. Sellers
shall advise Buyers of any condemnation proceeds received with respect to any
Real Property.

Section 6.8 Further Assurances. Upon request of a Party and without further
consideration, each other Party shall execute and deliver to the requesting
Party such documents and take such actions, which are consistent with the
provisions of this Agreement, as the requesting Party reasonably requests to
consummate more effectively the intent and purpose of the Parties under this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, if, after the Effective Time, Buyers seek
indemnification or recovery from one or more other parties to an Assumed
Contract or otherwise seeks to enforce such Assumed Contract and, to obtain
such indemnification, recovery or enforcement, it is necessary for Sellers or
their Affiliates to initiate a suit, participate in any enforcement proceeding
or otherwise provide assistance to Buyers, then, at the request of Buyers,
Sellers and their Affiliates shall take such action as Buyers may reasonably
request in connection with Buyers' efforts to obtain such indemnification,
recovery or enforcement; provided, however, that Buyers shall (a) reimburse
Sellers for all reasonable fees, costs and expenses related to such action and
(b) indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and
against any and all Losses relating to or arising from such action.

Section 6.9 Use of Marks. Except as otherwise contemplated by the Parties in
respect of the conversion of each Station Property by the applicable CIC
Conversion Date, Buyer shall not use trade names, trademarks, service marks,
trade dress, logos, designs, branded advertising or exterior or interior color
schemes identical or similar to, or dilutive of, those of Corner Store or of
any other convenience store services mark owned as of the Closing by Sellers.

Section 6.10 Contact with Business Relations. Except as set forth in Section
5.1(a), during the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of
the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, Buyers hereby agree that they are not authorized to and shall not (and
shall not permit any of its employees, agents, representatives or Affiliates
to) contact any employee (excluding any executive officer), customer,
supplier, dealer, material supplier, distributor or other material business
relation of a Seller regarding Sellers or the Business without the prior
written consent of Sellers in each instance.

Section 6.11 Operator-On Boarding; Seller Lease.





(a) Between the Effective Date and the Closing, Sellers shall reasonably
cooperate with Buyers efforts to establish a legally-binding business
relationship between Buyers and each commissioned marketer or other third
party that Buyers select to operate any Station Property upon and following
the applicable CIC Conversion Date; provided, however, that Buyers shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against
any actual documented out-of-pocket third-party expenses incurred by any
Seller Indemnified Parties relating to or arising from Sellers' compliance
with this Section 6.11(a), but solely to the extent that such third-party
expenses exceed the amount of third-party expenses that would otherwise be
incurred by Sellers to transfer such Station Property to Buyers.

(b) Between the Effective Date and the Closing, the Parties shall negotiate a
mutually agreeable lease or similar contractual arrangement (the "Seller
Lease"), consistent in all material respects with the Term Sheet attached
hereto as Exhibit D, pursuant to which Sellers shall lease the Station
Properties from Buyers and operate the Station Properties following the
Closing until such time as Buyers or the applicable third parties take over
the operation of the Station Properties.

deemed to be made or given without any such materiality qualifications;

(e) no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any amount of Losses
relating to any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the
extent such Indemnified Party (or other Buyer Indemnified Parties in the event

of a Seller Indemnified Party) has already recovered such amount with respect
to such matter pursuant to such provision or any other provision of this

Price, provided that nothing herein shall limit an Indemnified Party's
recovery for multiple occurrences of any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement;

(f) except for Losses in respect of (i) any indemnification claim arising out
of fraud, criminal activity, intentional misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation by Buyers in connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, (ii) breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in

8.4(f) and shall not count towards the Deductible), no Seller Indemnified
Party may shall be entitled to recover for any claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.3(a) in respect of the Buyer General Representations
until the aggregate amount of Losses recoverable under Section 8.3(a) equals
or exceeds the Deductible, after which the Seller Indemnified Parties may seek
recovery only for Losses in excess of the Deductible; provided, however, that
no Losses may be claimed by any Seller Indemnified Party or shall be

(i) NO PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR CLAIMS FOR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A CLAIM IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, VIOLATION OF ANY APPLICABLE
DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES ACT OR SIMILAR LAW OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE
PRINCIPLE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH DAMAGES ARE INCLUDED IN AND AWARDED (AND
ACTUALLY PAID) TO A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY OR OTHER THIRD PARTY AS PART OF A
CLAIM AGAINST THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY THAT IS OTHERWISE INDEMNIFIABLE PURSUANT
TO THIS ARTICLE VIII, AND EACH PARTY (AND BY ACCEPTANCE OF THE





BENEFITS OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE VIII EACH INDEMNIFIED PARTY)
RELEASES THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY FROM LIABILITY FOR ANY SUCH DAMAGES.

UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, INCLUDING CERCLA.

(k) If any Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to assert a claim for
indemnification either under Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b) on the basis of
Sellers' breach or default in, or failure to carry out, perform, satisfy and
discharge their obligations under Section 5.3, then the Buyer Indemnified
Party shall assert the claim (i) under Section 8.2(a) if the change, event,
circumstance, development, condition, occurrence or effect that was not
disclosed would not have resulted in any of the conditions set forth in
Article VII not being satisfied if it had been disclosed or (ii) under Section
8.2(b) if the change, event, circumstance, development, condition, occurrence
or effect that was not disclosed would have resulted in any of the conditions
set forth in Article VII not being satisfied if it had been disclosed. If any
Seller Indemnified Party is entitled to assert a claim for indemnification
either under Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(b) on the basis of Buyers' breach
or default in, or failure to carry out, perform, satisfy and discharge their
obligations under Section 5.3, then the Seller Indemnified Party shall assert
the claim (i) under Section 8.3(a) if the change, event, circumstance,
development, condition, occurrence or effect that was not disclosed would not
have resulted in any of the conditions set forth in Article VII not being
satisfied if it had been disclosed or (ii) under Section 8.3(b) if the change,
event, circumstance, development, condition, occurrence or effect that was not
disclosed would have resulted in any of the conditions set forth in Article
VII not being satisfied if it had been disclosed.

Section 8.5 Procedures Relating to Indemnification Between Buyers and Sellers.
Any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (either such Party, an
"Indemnified Party") making an indemnification claim pursuant to this ARTICLE
VIII for any matter not involving a Third Party Claim shall provide written
notice (each, an "Indemnification Notice") to the Party or Parties that are
obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Party in accordance with this
Agreement (such Party or Parties, the "Indemnifying Party") as soon as
reasonably practicable after becoming aware of such indemnification claim;
provided, however, that any failure on the part of the Indemnified Party to so
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not limit any of the obligations of the
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement except to the extent such Indemnifying
Party is actually prejudiced by reason of such failure. The Indemnification
Notice shall reasonably set forth the specific facts and circumstances, in
reasonable detail (to the extent then reasonably known), giving rise to the
claim, the amount of Loss or Losses (or a non-binding, reasonable estimate
thereof if the actual amount is not known and, to the extent known, the method
of calculation of such amount) that the Indemnified Party has suffered,
sustained or incurred, or expects to suffer, sustain or incur, and the
specific Section(s) of this Agreement upon which the Indemnified Party is
relying in seeking such indemnification and such other information with
respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. If an
Indemnifying Party disputes the sufficiency of





the Indemnification Notice, the Indemnified Party may send another
Indemnification Notice (and additional notices in response to additional
objections by the Indemnifying Party). For the purposes of any applicable
survival period (as set forth in Section 8.1 hereof), the date upon which the
first Indemnification Notice meeting the specifications of this Section 8.5
was delivered to the Indemnifying Party shall be treated as the date of notice
of the indemnification claim even if the Indemnification Notice is
subsequently amended and reissued. In the case of indemnification claims by
Buyers, as the Indemnified Party (or on behalf of other Buyer Indemnified
Parties), against Sellers, as the Indemnifying Party, for which Buyers intend
to recover Losses, in whole or in part, against the Indemnity Escrow Account,
Buyers shall also deliver a copy of the Indemnification Notice to the Escrow
Agent. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) days following its receipt of the Indemnification Notice that the
Indemnifying Party disputes it liability to the Indemnified Party under this
ARTICLE VIII or the amount thereof, the indemnification claim set forth in the
Indemnification Notice shall be conclusively deemed an indemnification claim
for which the Indemnifying Party is liable under this ARTICLE VIII, and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party
on demand or, in the case of any Indemnification Notice in which the amount of
the indemnification claim (or portion thereof) becomes finally determined. If
the Indemnifying Party timely disputes its liability with respect to such
indemnification claim as provided above, as promptly as possible, the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall establish the merits and
amount of such indemnification claim (by mutual agreement, litigation,
arbitration or otherwise) and, within five (5) Business Days following the
final determination of the merits and the amount of such indemnification
claim, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party immediately
available funds in an amount equal to such indemnification claim as determined
hereunder. If the Indemnified Parties are Buyer Indemnified Parties, to the
extent that such indemnification claim is to be paid from the Indemnity Escrow
Account in accordance with this ARTICLE VIII, Buyers and Sellers shall jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent to pay such amount to the Buyer Indemnified Parties
in accordance with this ARTICLE VIII and the applicable Escrow Agreement, such
joint instruction to be delivered to the Escrow Agent within five (5) Business
Days following the final determination of the merits and the amount of such
indemnification claim.

Section 8.6 Procedures Relating to Indemnification for Third Party Claims.

(a) Any Indemnified Party making a claim for indemnification pursuant to this
ARTICLE VIII for any Third Party Claim shall deliver an Indemnification Notice
to the Indemnifying Party promptly (but in no event more than thirty (30)
days) after becoming aware of any Proceeding against the Indemnified Party by
a third party (a "Third Party Claim"); provided, however, that any failure on
the part of the Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall
not limit any of the obligations of the Indemnifying Party under this
Agreement except to the extent such Indemnifying Party is actually and
materially prejudiced by reason of such failure. The Indemnification Notice
shall reasonably set forth the specific facts and circumstances, in reasonable
detail (to the extent then reasonably known), giving rise to the claim, the
amount of Loss or Losses (or a non-binding, reasonable estimate thereof if the
actual amount is not known and, to the extent known, the method of calculation
of such amount) that the Indemnified Party has suffered, sustained or
incurred, or expects to suffer, sustain or incur, and the specific Section(s)
of this Agreement upon which the Indemnified Party is relying in seeking such
indemnification and such other information





with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request, and a
copy of all pleadings and correspondence to or from any third party related
thereto, if available. Any Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate
in the defense of any Third Party Claim at such Indemnifying Party's expense,
and at its option shall be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party
Claim against an Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying
Party is, or could be determined to be, obligated to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement by appointing a
reputable counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, at the
Indemnifying Party's sole expense, to be the lead counsel in connection with
such defense; provided, that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of
its choice for such purpose (provided, that notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary other than the immediately following sentence, the fees and
expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified Party and
shall not be recoverable from such Indemnifying Party); provided that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or continue control of the
defense of any Third Party Claim (and the Indemnified Party shall assume
defense thereof and all reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses relating
thereto shall constitute Losses subject to indemnification hereunder) if (i)
the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
Proceeding or any other Proceeding by a Governmental Entity, (ii) the Third
Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party, (iii) the Third Party Claim has or would reasonably be expected to
result in Losses in excess of the applicable limitations on liability, if any,
to Sellers' indemnification obligations set forth in Section 8.4 with respect
to such Third Party Claim, and Sellers and Guarantor do not waive the
applicability of such limitations on liability (such that Sellers and
Guarantor assume liability for all Losses in respect of such Third Party
Claim), (iv) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes (based on the advice of
counsel) that the interests of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party with respect to such claim are in conflict with one another and, as a
result, the Indemnifying Party could not adequately represent the interests of
the Indemnified Party in such claim, (v) the Indemnified Party shall have been
advised by counsel that there are one or more legal or equitable defenses
available to it that conflict with or are in addition to those available to
the Indemnifying Party, and, in the reasonable judgment of counsel to the
Indemnified Party, counsel for the Indemnifying Party could not adequately
represent the interests of the Indemnified Party, (vi) the Indemnifying Party
has failed or is failing to defend in good faith the Third Party Claim; (vii)
the Indemnifying Party has not acknowledged in writing that such Third Party
Claim is subject to, and Indemnified Party is entitled to, indemnification
pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII (provided however that such acknowledgment shall
not include any waiver or statement regarding the merits of the Third Party
Claim itself), or (viii) the Indemnifying Party fails to give written notice
that it will assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within thirty (30)
days after delivery of the Indemnified Party's Indemnification Notice in
accordance with Section 11.6 and this Section 8.6(a).

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party is entitled to, and does, assume
the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 8.6, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to conduct such defense and take such
action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make
counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the name and on
behalf of the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party shall have the
right (but not the obligation) to participate in the defense of such Third
Party Claim and to employ, at its own expense, counsel separate from counsel
employed by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall





not be entitled to adjust, compromise or settle any Third Party Claim or
permit a default or consent to the entry of any judgment without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless (i) such settlement,
adjustment, compromise or judgment consists solely of money damages to be
fully paid by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) such settlement, adjustment,
compromise or judgment includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
each claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of a full and complete
written release of each Indemnified Party and its Representatives, reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, from all Losses or other Liability in
respect to such Third Party Claim, (iii) such settlement, adjustment,
compromise or judgment would not result in the statement of liability,
wrongdoing, criminal offense or finding or admission of any violation of Law
by the Indemnified Party, and (iv) as a result of such settlement, adjustment,
compromise or judgment, no injunctive or other equitable relief would be
imposed against the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not or
is not permitted to assume, or continue control of, or withdraws from, the
defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 8.6 and the
Indemnified Party assumes the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall not
settle, adjust or compromise or permit a default or consent to entry of any
judgment in respect of any Third Party Claim if the Indemnifying Party shall
have any obligation as a result of such settlement (whether monetary or
otherwise) unless such settlement, adjustment, compromise or judgment is
consented to in writing by the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. All attorneys' fees and other
costs and expenses relating to the defense by the Indemnified Party shall be
included in Losses.

(c) Each Party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Indemnified Party assumes the
defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 8.6, the
Indemnifying Party shall make available to the Indemnified Party any documents
and materials in its possession or control that may be necessary to the
defense, negotiation, settlement, adjustment or compromise of such Third Party
Claim. Without the limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance
with this Section 8.6, the Indemnified Party shall make available to the
Indemnifying Party any documents and materials in its possession or control
that may be necessary to the defense, negotiation, settlement, adjustment or
compromise of such Third Party Claim. Any consent to be given by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties under this Section 8.6 shall be given by Buyers acting on
behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and any consent to be given by the
Seller Indemnified Parties under this Section 8.6 shall be given solely by any
Seller acting for and on behalf of the Seller Indemnified Parties.

(d) With respect to a Third Party Claim under this Section 8.6, after (i) any
final decision, judgment, or award shall have been rendered by a Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in which to
appeal therefrom, (ii) a settlement, adjustment or compromise shall have been
consummated, or (iii) the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
have arrived at a mutually binding agreement, the Indemnified Party shall
forward to the Indemnifying Party notice of any sums due and owing by the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Agreement with respect to such
matter and (A) if the Indemnified Parties are Buyer Indemnified Parties (1) if
all or any portion of such sums is to be paid out of the Indemnity Escrow





Account, Buyers and Sellers shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay
such amount to the Buyer Indemnified Parties in accordance with this ARTICLE
VIII and the applicable Escrow Agreement, such joint instruction to be
delivered to the Escrow Agent within five (5) Business Days following the
determination of such sums in accordance with the foregoing clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii), and (2) the Indemnifying Party shall pay all of such remaining sums
so due and owing to the Indemnified Party in accordance with this Section 8.6,
within five (5) Business Days following the determination of such sums in
accordance with the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), and (B) if the
Indemnified Parties are Seller Indemnified Parties, the Indemnifying Party
shall pay all sums due and owing to the Indemnified Party in accordance with
this ARTICLE VIII, within five (5) Business Days following the determination
of such sums in accordance with the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii).

(e) If for whatever reason (including the Indemnifying Party's failure to pay
any judgment, settlement, adjustment, compromise, attorney's fees or court
costs with respect thereto), the Indemnified Party is required to pay any
indemnification claim or any portion thereof, or if the Indemnified Party is
permitted under the terms hereof to retain its own counsel with respect to any
indemnification claim at the Indemnifying Party's expense, the Indemnified
Party may pay such amounts which the Indemnified Party may deem reasonably
appropriate after giving written notice of same to the Indemnifying Party. In
the event of any such payments by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Section 8.6(e), the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party
for the amounts actually so paid by the Indemnified Party within five (5)
Business Days after the Indemnified Party's written demand therefor.

Section 8.7 Insurance Effect.

(a) The amount payable under this ARTICLE VIII in respect of any Loss shall be
calculated net of any insurance proceeds (other than proceeds under the
Environmental Insurance Policy) actually received by the Indemnified Party on
account thereof, which insurance proceeds shall be net of (i) any costs and
expenses of the Indemnified Party in pursuing the same and (ii) the deductible
for such insurance policies and any increase in the premium for such policies
for the next succeeding year to the extent arising out of or in connection
with such Loss, all of which shall constitute Losses subject to
indemnification hereunder; provided, that the Indemnified Party shall (and
shall cause its Affiliates to) use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain such insurance proceeds if the facts and circumstances support valid
claims against any policy of insurance of the Indemnified Person (or any of
its Affiliates); provided, further that in no event shall commercially
reasonable efforts require Buyers to institute any Proceedings to obtain such
insurance proceeds.

(b) In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made at any time after
an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party has been made with
respect to any indemnified Loss, then, to the extent of the amount of such
indemnification payment, a refund equal to the aggregate net amount of the
recovery (after deducting (i) any costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party
in pursuing the same and (ii) the deductible for such insurance policies and
any increase in the premium for such policies for the next succeeding year to
the extent arising out of or in connection with such Loss) shall be made
within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such recovery to the applicable
Indemnifying Party.





Section 8.8 Characterization of Indemnification Payments; Withholding. Unless
otherwise required by Law, all payments made pursuant to ARTICLE VIII hereof
shall be treated for all U.S. federal, state, local and/or non-U.S. Tax
purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

Section 8.9 Source of Payments. Subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 8.4:

(a) Any amounts owing by Sellers with respect to an indemnification claim
under Section 8.2(a), solely in respect of the Seller General Representations,
shall be made solely by disbursement of the then Available Indemnity Escrow
Amount pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. As used herein, "Available Indemnity
Escrow Amount" means, as of the time of determination, the portion of the
funds then held in the Indemnity Escrow Account against which no Buyer
Indemnified Party shall have made an indemnification claim by delivery of an
Indemnification Notice in accordance with Section 8.5, which claim remains
outstanding and unsettled.

(b) Any amounts owing by Sellers with respect to an indemnification claim
under (i) Section 8.2(b), Section 8.2(c), Section 8.2(d), Section 8.2(e),
Section 8.2(f), Section 8.2(g), Section 8.2(h) or Section 8.2(i) or (ii)
Section 8.2(a) in respect of Seller Fundamental Representations shall be made
as follows: (A) first, by release of funds (to the extent available) to the
Buyer Indemnified Parties from the Indemnity Escrow Account by the Escrow
Agent, provided that Buyer Indemnified Parties shall only be required to
recover first pursuant to this clause (A) if, and solely to the extent that,
the then Available Indemnity Escrow Amount remains greater than or equal to
fifty percent (50%) of the original Indemnity Escrow Amount after such
recovery (in whole or in part), and (B) thereafter (and to the extent that any
remaining amounts are due in respect of such indemnification claim and any
other indemnification claims under (x) Section 8.2(b), Section 8.2(c), Section
8.2(d), Section 8.2(e), Section 8.2(f), Section 8.2(g), Section 8.2(h) or
Section 8.2(i) or (y) Section 8.2(a) in respect of Seller Fundamental
Representations), directly by Sellers to the Buyer Indemnified Parties by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the applicable Sellers within five
(5) Business Days of the final determination thereof.

(c) Any amounts payable by Buyers pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the applicable Sellers
within five (5) Business Days of the final determination thereof.

Section 8.10 Duty to Mitigate. In all cases in which an Indemnified Party is
entitled to be indemnified in accordance with this Agreement, such Indemnified
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all Losses,
including by pursuing commercially reasonable rights and remedies available to
such Indemnified Party against third parties which are reasonably likely to
result in a net reduction of Losses with respect to which such Indemnified
Party may be entitled to indemnification hereunder and by incurring costs to
the extent necessary to remedy the breach which gives rise to the Loss;
provided, however, that such Indemnified Party shall not be required to
commence or participate in any litigation or offer or grant any accommodation
(material or otherwise) to any third parties; provided, further, that (a) all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with such efforts to mitigate and
(b) the deductible for any insurance policies that cover Losses and any
increase in the premium for such policies for the next succeeding year to the





extent arising out of or in connection with such Losses, shall, in each case,
constitute Losses subject to indemnification hereunder.

For the avoidance of doubt, absent bad faith a failure to successfully
mitigate on the part of an Indemnified Party shall not relieve any
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder nor shall an Indemnified Party
have any liability to any Indemnifying Party for any such failure.

Section 8.11 Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements and obligations of an Indemnifying Party contained in
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and an Indemnified Party's right
to indemnification or any other remedy with respect thereto, shall not be
affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made at any time by
or on behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any of its
Representatives) or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by
or on behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any of its
Representatives) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy of,
compliance with or performance of, any such representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation. The waiver or non-assertion of any
condition set forth in Section 7.1, Section 7.2 or Section 7.3, as the case
may be, or any termination right set forth in Section 10.1 based on the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any such covenant, agreement or obligation, shall not affect
any Indemnified Party's right to indemnification or any other remedy based on
such representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and obligations.



Section 8.12 Exclusive Remedy. Subject to the right of each Party to seek
specific performance and injunction of this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.20 or any other provisions hereof granting any other form of equitable
relief or any other rights or remedies or providing for dispute resolution
following the Closing (including Section 6.1 and Section 8.13), from and after
the Closing, and without limiting the provisions of this ARTICLE VIII, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that the indemnification provisions contained in
this ARTICLE VIII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties for
any Losses arising out of, related to, or in connection with this Agreement or
the Closing Documents, whether sounding in tort, contract or otherwise, or
whether at law or in equity. To avoid any confusion, the foregoing provisions
of this Section 8.12 shall not limit or have any adverse effect on an
Indemnified Party's rights, remedies or recourse under the Escrow Agreement,
the Site Access Agreements or the Seller Lease. In furtherance of the
foregoing, but subject to the exceptions set forth in the two immediately
preceding sentences and Section 8.13, each Seller, on the one hand, and each
Buyer, on the other hand, hereby waives on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights and
remedies it or they may have against the other Party arising under or based
upon this Agreement or the Closing Documents, in equity or otherwise
(including those based on statutory and common law negligence and strict
liability or arising under any Environmental Laws, including CERCLA), with
respect to indemnification claims except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this ARTICLE VIII. No Party shall be entitled to a
rescission of this Agreement (or any Ancillary Agreements) related to the
breach of any representations, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein.





Section 8.13 No Limitations or Waiver Relating to Claims for Fraud,
Intentional Misrepresentation, Criminal Activity or Intentional Misconduct.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the liability
of any Party under this ARTICLE VIII shall be in addition to, and not
exclusive of, any other liability that such Party may have at law or in equity
(whether arising by contract, tort or otherwise) based on such Party's fraud,
intentional misrepresentation, criminal activity or intentional misconduct. No
provision set forth in this Agreement, including any other provision of this
ARTICLE VIII, shall be deemed a waiver by any Party to this Agreement of any
right or remedy which such Party may have at law or in equity based on any
other Party's fraud, intentional misrepresentation, criminal activity or
intentional misconduct, nor will any such provisions limit, or be deemed to
limit, (a) the amounts of recovery sought or awarded in any such claim for
such other Party's fraud, intentional misrepresentation, criminal activity or
intentional misconduct; (b) the time period during which a claim for such
other Party's fraud, intentional misrepresentation, criminal activity or
intentional misconduct; or (c) the recourse that any such Party may seek
against another Party with respect to a claim for such other Party's fraud,
intentional misrepresentation, criminal activity or intentional misconduct.
For purposes hereof, any Party's fraud, intentional misrepresentation,
criminal activity or intentional misconduct by any Representative of any
Seller or any Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be deemed the Party's fraud, intentional misrepresentation,
criminal activity or intentional misconduct of, respectively, Sellers and
Buyers.

contemplated hereby illegal or that otherwise prohibits consummation of such
transactions;

(f) by Buyers or Sellers if there shall be in effect a final, nonappealable
Order of a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or awarding substantial damages in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(f) shall not be available
to Buyers, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other hand, if such Order was
primarily due to (i) the failure of such Part(y)(ies) to perform or comply
with any of its covenants or agreements under this Agreement or (ii) the
inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of such Part(y)(ies)
under this Agreement (for purposes hereof a failure to perform or comply or an
inaccuracy or breach by any Seller shall be deemed a failure to perform or
comply or an inaccuracy or breach by all Sellers);

(g) by Sellers, if any of the representations or warranties of Buyers set
forth in ARTICLE IV shall either be or have become inaccurate or if either
Buyer shall have violated, breached or failed to perform any covenant or
agreement on the part of Buyers set forth in this Agreement (including an
obligation to consummate the Closing), in either case so as to cause the
failure of any condition to the Closing set forth in either Section 7.1 or
Section 7.3, respectively, to be satisfied and the breach or breaches causing
such representations or warranties to be or have become inaccurate, or the
violations, breaches or failures to perform any covenant or agreement, as
applicable, cannot be cured or are not cured within the later to occur of the
Initial Termination Date and thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is
delivered by Sellers to Buyers; provided that Sellers are not then in material
breach or failure to perform any of their respective covenants or agreements
under this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of Sellers under
this Agreement shall either be or have become inaccurate, in either case so as
to cause any condition to the Closing set forth in either Section 7.1 or
Section 7.2 from being satisfied; provided, however, that the foregoing cure
period shall not be applicable with respect to a violation, breach or failure
to perform any covenant or agreement required to be performed by Buyers on the
Closing Date;

(h) by Buyers, if any of the representations or warranties of Sellers set
forth in ARTICLE III shall either be or have become inaccurate or if either
Seller shall have violated, breached or failed to perform any covenant or
agreement on the part of Sellers set forth in this Agreement (including an
obligation to consummate the Closing), in either case so as to cause the
failure of any condition to the Closing set forth in either Section 7.1 or
Section 7.2, respectively, to be satisfied and the breach or breaches causing
such representations or warranties to be or have become inaccurate, or the
violations, breaches or failures to perform any covenant or agreement, as
applicable, cannot be cured or are not cured within the later to occur of the
Initial Termination Date and thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is
delivered by Buyers to Sellers; provided that Buyers are not then in material
violation, breach or failure to perform any of their respective covenants or
agreements under this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of Buyers
under this Agreement shall either be or have become inaccurate, in either case
so as to cause any condition to the Closing set forth in either Section 7.1 or
Section 7.3 from being satisfied; provided, however, that the foregoing cure
period shall not be applicable with respect to a violation, breach or failure
to perform any covenant or agreement required to be performed by Sellers on
the Closing Date;





(i) by Buyers, if there shall have occurred any Material Adverse Effect or any
change, event, circumstance, development, condition, occurrence or effect
that, individually or in the aggregate with any other any change, event,
circumstance, development, condition, occurrence or effect, would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

(j) by Buyers, if all conditions in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 are satisfied
(or are capable of being satisfied and would have been satisfied at the
Closing were the Closing to occur on the date of termination) or waived prior
to the date of termination, Buyers have not materially breached this Agreement
and have tendered performance, Sellers have no termination right pursuant to
Section 10.1(g), and Sellers do not proceed to consummate the Closing; or

(k) by Sellers, if all conditions in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 are satisfied
(or are capable of being satisfied and would have been satisfied at the
Closing were the Closing to occur on the date of termination) or waived prior
to the date of termination, Sellers have not materially breached this
Agreement and have tendered performance, Buyers have no termination right
pursuant to Section 10.1(h), and Buyers do not proceed to consummate the
Closing.

Section 10.2 Procedure for Termination. To terminate this Agreement as
provided in Section 10.1 (other than as provided in subclause (i)), the
terminating Part(y)(ies) shall provide the other Part(y)(ies) with written
notice of its election to terminate this Agreement, which such notice shall
set forth a description of the basis upon which such Part(y)(ies) are
terminating this Agreement, and upon delivery of such written notice in
accordance with Section 11.6, this Agreement shall terminate and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned, without further action by
any Party.

Section 10.3 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is validly terminated
as provided in Section 10.1, then this Agreement shall forthwith become wholly
void and of no further force and effect, all further obligations of the
Parties under this Agreement shall terminate effective as of the effective
date and time of such termination, and there shall be no Liability under this
Agreement, or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, on the part of Buyer or Sellers, except that:

(a) the respective obligations of Buyers or Sellers, as the case may be, under
Section 5.1(b), Section 10.2 and Section 10.3 and ARTICLE II and ARTICLE XI
(except for Section 11.12) and any applicable definitions used in this
Agreement shall survive any such termination and remain in full force and
effect;

(b) nothing in this Section 10.3 shall relieve any Party from any Liability of
any Party for any violation, breach or failure to perform any of its covenants
or agreements or for any inaccuracy or breach of any of its representations or
warranties under this Agreement prior to the effective date of such
termination or, subject to Section 10.3(e) or Section 10.3(f), as applicable,
be deemed to constitute a waiver of any available remedy (including specific
performance, if available) to the other Party(ies) for any such breach, and
the right of the other Party(ies) to pursue all legal remedies and Losses in
respect of such failure shall survive termination of this Agreement;





(c) if this Agreement is terminated under Section 10.1 other than by (i)
Sellers in accordance with Section 10.1(g) or Section 10.1(k), or (ii) Buyers
in accordance with Section 10.1(h) or Section 10.1(j), Buyers shall be
entitled to the return of the Deposit, together with all accrued interest, and
neither Sellers nor Buyers shall be precluded from pursuing any other remedy
available to them in connection with the termination of this Agreement;

(d) if this Agreement is terminated by Buyers in accordance with Section
10.1(h) or Section 10.1(j):

(i) Buyers shall be entitled to the return of the Deposit, together with all
accrued interest;

(ii) Subject to Section 10.3(e), Buyers shall not be precluded from pursuing
any other remedy available to Buyers in connection with the termination of
this Agreement; and

(iii) in addition to any other obligations accruing under this Agreement,
Sellers shall be jointly and severally liable for and shall pay to Buyers (by
wire transfer of immediately available funds) within five (5) Business Days
after such termination an amount equal to all actual and documented out-of-
pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred by Buyers in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including out-of-pocket fees,
costs and expenses incurred to collect the Deposit and amounts owed by Sellers
to Buyers pursuant to this Section 10.3;

(e) if (i) (A) this Agreement is terminated by Buyers in accordance with
Section 10.1(h) or Section 10.1(j) or (B) this Agreement is terminated by
Sellers in accordance with Section 10.1(b) and Sellers do not effectuate a
Like-Kind Exchange prior to the Initial Termination Date and (ii) any of
Sellers or their respective Affiliates consummate any Acquisition Proposal on
or before the date that is nine (9) months following the date of such
termination (or enter into any agreement in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal during such period; it being understood and agreed that Sellers shall
be deemed to have entered into any such agreement with any third party during
such period if any of Sellers or their respective Affiliates (1) conducted any
negotiations with such third party before or on the Effective Date with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal and (2)
either (x) enter into any agreement in connection with an Acquisition Proposal
with such third party or (y) consummate an Acquisition Proposal with such
third party, in either case, on or before the date that is 18 months after the
date of such termination), then (A) Sellers shall be jointly and severally
liable for and shall pay to Buyers (by wire transfer of immediately available
funds) within five (5) Business Days after the first to occur of such
consummation or entrance into such agreement, an amount equal to Ten Million
Dollars ($10,000,000), plus an amount equal to all actual and documented out-
of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred by Buyers to collect the amounts
owed by Sellers to Buyers pursuant to this Section 10.3(e), plus any interest
thereon that may be awarded by any Governmental Entity, and (B) Buyers' sole
and exclusive remedy by reason of such Acquisition Proposal shall be the
payment of the amounts owed by Sellers to Buyers pursuant to this Section
10.3(e), as liquidated damages for Sellers' breach hereunder with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal, it being agreed that the





damages by reason of such Sellers' breach are difficult, if not impossible, to
ascertain, and the amounts owed by Sellers to Buyers pursuant to this Section
10.3(e) represent the Parties' best and most accurate estimate of the damages
that would be suffered by Buyers if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement should fail to close due to an Acquisition Proposal and that such
estimate is reasonable under the circumstances existing as of the Effective
Date and under the circumstances that Sellers and Buyers reasonably anticipate
would exist at the time of such breach. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE RIGHT TO
PAYMENT OF THE AMOUNTS DUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION 10.3(e) AS
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES SHALL BE BUYERS' SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, AT LAW AND IN
EQUITY, IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER RELIEF TO WHICH BUYERS OTHERWISE MIGHT BE
ENTITLED BECAUSE OF SELLERS' BREACH OR DEFAULT WITH RESPECT TO AN ACQUISITION
PROPOSAL AND THAT BUYERS HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT ANY OF BUYERS MIGHT HAVE HAD
TO AN ACTION FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE WITH RESPECT TO SUCH BREACH OR DEFAULT.
For the avoidance of doubt, Buyers shall not be entitled to more than one
recovery of any amounts that may become payable by Sellers to Buyers pursuant
to this Section 10.3(e); and

(f) if this Agreement is terminated by Sellers in accordance with Section
10.1(g) or Section 10.1(k), Sellers shall be entitled to receive payment of
the Deposit, together with all accrued interest, as Sellers' sole and
exclusive remedy by reason thereof, as liquidated damages for Buyers' breach
hereunder, it being agreed that the damages by reason of Buyers' breach are
difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain, and the amount of the Deposit
represents the Parties' best and most accurate estimate of the damages that
would be suffered by Sellers if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement should fail to close and that such estimate is reasonable under the
circumstances existing as of the Effective Date and under the circumstances
that Sellers and Buyers reasonably anticipate would exist at the time of such
breach. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE RIGHT TO RETAIN THE DEPOSIT AS LIQUIDATED
DAMAGES SHALL BE SELLERS' SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, AT LAW AND IN EQUITY, IN
LIEU OF ANY OTHER RELIEF TO WHICH SELLERS OTHERWISE MIGHT BE ENTITLED BECAUSE
OF BUYERS' BREACH OR DEFAULT AND THAT SELLERS HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT ANY OF
SELLERS MIGHT HAVE HAD TO AN ACTION FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE WITH RESPECT TO
SUCH BREACH OR DEFAULT.

For purposes of this Section 10.3, a violation, breach or inaccuracy of any
provision or representation or warranty of this Agreement by any Seller or
Buyer shall also be deemed a breach by all Sellers or Buyers, respectively.

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 11.1 Publicity. The Parties agree that, from and after the date of
this Agreement, prior to the Closing, no public release, written statement or
announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued
or made without the prior written consent of both Parties, except for the
content of any such release or announcement that is required by Law, including
the rules or regulations of any United States or foreign securities exchange,
which release or announcement shall be provided to the other Party for its
review and approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) as soon as reasonably practicable prior





to such disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party may issue a press
release on the Closing Date, provided that such Party shall allow the other
Party reasonable time to comment on such release in advance of, and approve,
such issuance (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

Section 11.2 Assignment. Except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth in
this Agreement, no Party may assign, transfer or encumber this Agreement, or
its rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, voluntarily or by
operation of Law, without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and
any attempted assignment, transfer or encumbrance without such consent shall
be void and without effect; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
either Buyer may, without the prior consent of Sellers, assign or transfer any
of its rights or obligations hereunder (a) to an Affiliate of such Buyer or
(b) to third parties as are reasonably necessary to facilitate the conversion
of any Station Property into a Station Property that becomes operated by a
commissioned marketer or other third party.at or after the Closing, which may
include assigning to one or more third parties the right to acquire certain
Assets, and the obligation to pay the purchase price for such Assets, and the
inspection rights in Section 5.1(a). Upon any such permitted assignment, the
references in this Agreement to the applicable Buyer shall also apply to any
such assignee unless the context otherwise requires. No such permitted
assignment by either Buyer, in whole or in party, shall release such Buyer of
any of its obligations hereunder, including with respect to the payment of the
entire purchase price. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein or
in any Ancillary Agreement shall prevent any deemed indirect transfer by
Sellers of this Agreement as a result of a recapitalization, reorganization,
merger, consolidation or other similar business combination of Sellers,
Guarantor or their respective Affiliates; provided that if Sellers, Guarantor
and/or such Affiliates are not the continuing or surviving entities of such
transaction, the applicable continuing or surviving entity shall have assumed
the obligations of Sellers and/or Guarantor, as applicable, under this
Agreement.

Section 11.3 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective
permitted successors and permitted assigns.

modifications, amendments or supplements to this Agreement, whether by course
of conduct or otherwise, shall be valid and binding unless set forth in a
written agreement executed and delivered by the Parties.

Section 11.5 Waiver. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no waiver
by any Party of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be effective
unless set forth in a written instrument making specific reference to this
Agreement executed and delivered by the Party so waiving. No failure on the
part of a Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or
remedy shall constitute a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power, or remedy by such Party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or remedy.
The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall
not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.

reference purposes only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

Section 11.9 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be
declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or
unenforceable, then such provisions shall be construed so that the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected, but shall remain in full
force and effect, and any such illegal, void or unenforceable provisions shall
be deemed, without further action on the part of any person or entity, to be
modified, amended and/or limited, but only to the extent necessary to render
the same valid and enforceable in the applicable jurisdiction, so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon a
determination that any provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner in order that the transaction contemplated hereby is
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.





Section 11.10 No Strict Construction. Notwithstanding the fact that this
Agreement has been drafted or prepared by one of the Parties, each Party
confirms that both it and its counsel have reviewed, negotiated and adopted
this Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding of the Parties. The
language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by
the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction
shall be applied against any Party.

Section 11.11 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial. The
Parties agree that this Agreement and all matters arising from or relating to
this Agreement shall be governed by and construed and the rights and
obligations of the Parties hereunder determined in accordance with the Laws of

The Parties irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the jurisdiction of the
United States District Court for the Western District of Texas or, if
jurisdiction is not available therein, the Texas district court located in
Bexar County, Texas, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, and each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally agrees

that such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the Parties agrees that a final
judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in an appropriate
court pursuant to this Section 11.11 shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Parties, as the case may be, and may be enforced in any other courts to whose
jurisdiction the Parties, as the case may be, are or may be subject, by suit
upon such judgment. THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO

Date, to assign all or a portion of its rights under this Agreement and/or the
Deposit Escrow Agreement to a "qualified intermediary" (as that term is
defined in U.S. Treasury Regulations § 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)) or to a "qualified
exchange accommodation titleholder" (as that term is defined in U.S. Revenue
Procedure 2000-37), in order to attempt to structure the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in relevant part, as a like-kind exchange or
reverse like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code and any
corresponding state and/or local income tax provision ("Like-Kind Exchange").
The Parties agree to cooperate in good faith and execute any necessary
agreements and/or other documents to effectuate any Like-Kind Exchange,
provided: (a) such documents shall not modify Sellers' or





Buyers' representations, warranties or obligations under this Agreement or the
Deposit Escrow Agreement; (b) such documents shall not relieve Sellers or
Buyers of any Liability under this Agreement or the Deposit Escrow Agreement;
(c) the Purchase Price paid by Buyers shall not be different from that which

implied in this Agreement, each Party covenants, agrees and acknowledges that
no recourse under this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any documents or
instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement shall be had against any of Sellers' or Buyers' respective past,
present or future Related Parties, in each case other than Sellers, Buyers or
any of their respective successors and permitted assignees under this
Agreement, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any applicable Law, it being expressly
agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to,
be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any of the past, present or future
Related Parties, as such, for any obligation or liability of a Seller or a
Buyer under this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any documents or
instruments delivered in connection herewith or therewith for any claim based
on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or liabilities or their
creation; provided, however, nothing in this Section 11.13 shall relieve or
otherwise limit the liability of a Seller or a Buyer, as such, for any breach
or violation of its obligations under such agreements, documents or
instruments.

Section 11.14 Disclosure Schedules; Schedule Supplements. The Disclosure
Schedules and the Schedule Supplements shall be arranged in separate parts
corresponding to the numbered and lettered Sections and subsections contained
in this Agreement, and the information disclosed in any numbered or lettered
part shall be deemed to relate to and to qualify other representations and
warranties only to the extent the applicability of such disclosure to such
other representations and warranties is readily apparent on its face. If there
is any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this Agreement and
those in the Disclosure Schedules, the statements in the body of this
Agreement shall control. The information contained in this Agreement and the
Disclosure Schedules attached hereto is, and the Schedule Supplements shall
be, disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any Party to
any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of Law or
breach of contract). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
Disclosure Schedules, the Schedule Supplements or in this Agreement, the
information and disclosures contained in any section of the Disclosure
Schedules or the Schedule Supplements shall be deemed to be disclosed and
incorporated by reference in any other Section of the Disclosure Schedules or
the Schedule Supplements as though fully set forth in such other section of
the Disclosure Schedules or the Schedule Supplements for which applicability
of such information and disclosure is reasonably apparent. The fact that any
item of information is disclosed in any section of the Disclosure Schedules or
the Schedule Supplements shall not be construed to mean that such information
is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Such information and the dollar
thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the
terms "material" or "Material Adverse





Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement. Any capitalized term used in
the Disclosure Schedules or in the Schedule Supplements and not otherwise
defined therein has the meaning given to such term in this Agreement.

Section 11.15 No Third Party Beneficiary. Except as set forth in ARTICLE VIII,
the Parties agree that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied,
is intended to confer any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement on any Persons other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No Person, other than the Parties, may rely
hereon or derive any benefit hereby as a third-party beneficiary or otherwise.

Section 11.16 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements together with the Schedules and Exhibits hereto
and thereto, constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect
to the subject matter contained herein and therein, and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, oral and written, between the Parties, with
respect to the subject matter hereof; there are no conditions to this
Agreement that are not expressly stated in this Agreement. All Exhibits,
Schedules and other attachments identified in this Agreement are a material
part of this Agreement and are incorporated herein by reference.

Section 11.17 No Recording of this Agreement. Before the Closing, neither
Party shall record this Agreement among any land or clerk's records or with
any other governmental office. If either Party records this Agreement, it
shall be deemed, at the option of the other Party: (a) ipso facto null and
void and of no further force; or (b) a material breach and serve as a basis
for termination or other remedies as provided by this Agreement.

Section 11.18 Time of Essence. With regard to all covenants, dates and time
periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.
Without limiting the foregoing, Buyers and Sellers hereby confirm their
intention and agreement that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, time shall be of the essence for the performance of all actions
(including, without limitation, the giving of notices, the delivery of
documents and the funding of money) required or permitted to be taken under
each and every provision of this Agreement, notwithstanding any subsequent
modification or extension of any date or time period that is provided for
under this Agreement.

Section 11.19 Prevailing Party. If any litigation, other court action, or
proceeding is commenced by any Party to enforce its rights under this
Agreement against any other Party, all fees, costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, incurred by the prevailing Party
in such litigation, action, arbitration, or proceeding shall be reimbursed by
the losing Party. As used in this Section, the term "prevailing Party" shall
mean the Party that has succeeded upon a significant issue in the action and
achieved a material benefit with respect to the claims at issue, taken as a
whole.

Section 11.20 Specific Performance. Seller acknowledges and agrees that
irreparable damage would occur to Buyers in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, Buyers shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this





Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which Buyers may be entitled at
law or in equity. Such remedies shall, however, be cumulative and not
exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies which Buyers may have
under this Agreement or otherwise.

Section 11.21 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or .pdf signatures) in one or more counterparts. All
counterparts shall collectively be deemed to constitute a single agreement,
such agreement becoming effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to all other Parties, it being
understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart.

Section 11.22 Time Periods. Any reference in this Agreement to the time for
the performance of obligations or elapsed time shall mean consecutive calendar
days, months, or years, as applicable. Whenever the term "day" is used in this
Agreement, it shall refer to a calendar day unless otherwise specified. In
computing any period of time under this Agreement, the date of the act or
event from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be
included. In the event the time for performance of any obligation hereunder

Section 11.23 Parent Guarantee. Guarantor shall cause each Seller to comply in
all respects with each of the representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be performed by
such Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements. As a material inducement to Buyers' willingness to enter into this
Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder, Guarantor hereby
unconditionally guarantees full performance and payment by each Seller of each
of the covenants, obligations and undertakings required to be performed by
such Seller under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, subject to all
terms, conditions and limitations contained in this Agreement, and hereby
represents, acknowledges and agrees that any breach of any such representation
and warranty or default in the performance(including any nonpayment) of any
such covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking of any Seller shall also
be deemed to be a breach or default of Guarantor, and each Buyer shall have
the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to pursue any and all available
remedies it may have arising out of any such breach or nonperformance
(including nonpayment) directly against either or all of Guarantor and Sellers
in the first instance, in all cases subject to all terms, conditions and
limitations contained in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this
guaranty is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guarantee of the full
and punctual payment and performance by Sellers of their obligations hereunder
and not of collection, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that in no
event shall Guarantor be liable to Buyers or any other Buyer Indemnified Party
for any Losses if and to the extent that Sellers are not liable to Buyers or
any other Buyer Indemnified Party; provided, however, that Guarantor's
liability in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section 11.23
shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise
affected by (a) the failure of any Buyer or other Buyer Indemnified Party to
assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Sellers
(or any of their permitted assignees) or any other Person; (b) any change in
time, place or manner of payment of any of the covenants, obligations and
undertakings required to be performed by any Seller under this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements or any modification, amendment or supplement of any
of





the terms or provisions of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, as the
case may be, made in accordance with the terms thereof or any other agreement
evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of such
covenants, obligations or agreements; (c) the addition, substitution or
release of Sellers (or any of their permitted assignees) or any other Person;
(d) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Sellers
(or any of their permitted assignees) or any other Person; (e) any insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization, dissolution, liquidation or other similar
Proceeding affecting Sellers (or any of their permitted assignees) or any
other Person; (f) the existence of any claim, set-off or other right which
Guarantor may have at any time against Sellers or the Buyer Indemnified
Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, whether in connection with the
obligations of Guarantor under this Section 11.23 or otherwise; or (g) any
other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or
equitable discharge or defense of any Seller that would not also constitute a
legal or equitable discharge or defense of Guarantor.
