Company (whether or not presently convertible into or exercisable or

Stock) to employees, directors and advisors pursuant to the Companys stock
purchase plan and pursuant to the conversion or exercise of Common Stock
Equivalents outstanding as of the date of the most recently filed periodic

contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which the Company

decision, have or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary, nor any director or officer thereof,
is or has been the subject of any Action involving a claim of violation of or
liability under federal or state securities laws or a claim of breach
of fiduciary duty. There has not been, and to the knowledge of the Company,
there is not pending or contemplated, any investigation by the Commission
involving the Company or any current or former director or officer of the
Company. The Commission has not issued any stop order or other order
suspending the effectiveness of any registration statement filed by the
Company or any Subsidiary under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act.

 

(k) _Labor Relations_. No material labor dispute exists or, to the knowledge
of the Company, is imminent with respect to any of the employees of the
Company which would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. None of the Companys or its Subsidiaries employees is a member of a
union that relates to such employees relationship with the Company, and
neither the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to a collective
bargaining agreement, and the Company and its Subsidiaries believe that their
relationships with their employees are good. No executive officer, to the
knowledge of the Company, is, or is now expected to be, in violation of any
material term of any employment contract, confidentiality, disclosure or
proprietary information agreement or non-competition agreement, or any other
contract or agreement or any restrictive covenant, and the continued
employment of each such executive officer does not subject the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to any liability with respect to any of the foregoing
matters. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all U.S.
federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to employment
and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and
hours, except where the failure to be in compliance would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(l) _Compliance_. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (i) is in default
under or in violation of (and no event has occurred that has not been waived
that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would result in a default by the
Company or any Subsidiary under), nor has the Company or any Subsidiary
received notice of a claim that it is in default under or that it is in
violation of, any indenture, loan or credit agreement or any other agreement
or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties
is bound (whether or not such default or violation has been waived), (ii) is
in violation of any order of any court, arbitrator or governmental body, or
(iii) is or has been in violation of any statute, rule or regulation of
any governmental authority, including without limitation all foreign,
federal, state and local laws applicable to its business and all such laws
that affect the environment, except in each case as would not have or
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



\- 12 -  (m) _Regulatory Permits_. Except for regulatory matters related to the
Companys products and product candidates (which matters are covered solely
by the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.1(ii) below), the
Company and the Subsidiaries possess all certificates, authorizations and
permits issued by the appropriate federal, state, local or foreign regulatory
authorities necessary to conduct their respective businesses as described in
the SEC Reports, except where the failure to possess such permits would not
have or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (" _Material
Permits_ "), and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any
notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any
Material Permit.

 

(n) _Title to Assets_. The Company and the Subsidiaries do not own any real
property. The Company and the Subsidiaries have good and marketable title in
all tangible personal property owned by them that is material to the business
of the Company and the Subsidiaries, in each case free and clear of all Liens,
except for Liens as do not materially affect the value of such property and
do not materially interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such
property by the Company and the Subsidiaries and Liens for the payment of
federal, state or other taxes, the payment of which is neither delinquent nor
subject to penalties. Any real property and facilities held under lease by
the Company and the Subsidiaries are held by them under valid, subsisting and
enforceable leases with which the Company and the Subsidiaries are in
compliance.

 

(o) _Patents and Trademarks_. To the knowledge of the Company, the Company and
the Subsidiaries have, or have rights to use, all patents, patent
applications, trademarks, trademark applications, service marks, trade names,
trade secrets, inventions, copyrights, licenses and other intellectual
property rights and similar rights necessary or material for use in connection
with their respective businesses as described in the SEC Reports and which
the failure to so have would have a Material Adverse Effect (collectively, the
" _Intellectual Property Rights_ "). Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has received a notice (written or otherwise) that the Intellectual Property
Rights used by the Company or any Subsidiary violates or infringes upon the
rights of any Person. The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable
security measures to protect the secrecy, confidentiality and value of all of
their intellectual properties, except where failure to do so would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(p) _Insurance_. The Company and the Subsidiaries are insured by insurers of
recognized financial responsibility against such losses and risks and in such
amounts as the Company believes are prudent and customary in the businesses in
which the Company and the Subsidiaries are engaged, including, but not limited
to, directors and officers insurance coverage at least equal to the aggregate
Subscription Amount. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any reason to
believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as
and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar
insurers as may be necessary to continue its business without a significant
increase in cost.

 



\- 13 -  (q) _Transactions With Affiliates and Employees_. Except as set forth in the
SEC Reports, none of the officers or directors of the Company and, to the
knowledge of the Company, none of the employees of the Company is presently a
party to any transaction with the Company or any Subsidiary (other than for
services as employees, officers and directors), that would be required to be
disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the
Securities Act.

(r) _Sarbanes-Oxley; Internal Accounting Controls_. The Company is in material
compliance with all provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which are
applicable to it as of the First Closing Date. The Company and the
Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance
with managements general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability, (iii) access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization, and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared
with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences. The Company has established
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the Company and designed such disclosure controls
and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the Commissions rules and forms. The Companys certifying
officers have evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by the Companys
most recently filed periodic report under the Exchange Act (such date, the "
_Evaluation Date_ "). The Company presented in its most recently filed
periodic report under the Exchange Act the conclusions of the certifying
officers about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures
based on their evaluations as of the Evaluation Date. Since the Evaluation
Date, there have been no changes in the Companys internal control over
financial reporting (as such term is defined in the Exchange Act) that has
materially affected in an adverse manner, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect in an adverse manner, the Companys internal control over
financial reporting.

(s) _Certain Fees_. Except for fees paid to Griffin Securities, Inc., Musket
Research Associates, Inc. and Andrew Garrett, Inc. for the specific Purchasers
introduced by each such broker to the Company, no brokerage or finders fees
or commissions are or will be payable by the Company to any broker, financial
advisor or consultant, finder, placement agent, investment banker, bank or
other Person with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents. The Purchasers shall have no obligation with respect to any fees
or with respect to any claims made by or on behalf of other Persons for fees
of a type contemplated in this Section that may be due in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

 

(t) _Private Placement_. Assuming the accuracy of the Purchasers
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.2, no registration
under the Securities Act is required for the offer and sale of the Securities
by the Company to the Purchasers as contemplated hereby. The issuance and sale
of the Securities hereunder does not contravene the rules and regulations
of the Trading Market.

 



\- 14 -  (u) _Investment Company_. The Company is not, and is not an Affiliate of,
and immediately after receipt of payment for the Securities, will not be or
be an Affiliate of, an "investment company" within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Company shall conduct its
business in a manner so that it will not become subject to the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended.

(v) _Registration Rights_. Other than as set forth in the SEC Reports, no
Person has any right to cause the Company to effect the registration under the
Securities Act of any securities of the Company other than those securities
which are currently registered on an effective registration statement on file
with the Commission.

(w) _Listing and Maintenance Requirements_. The Companys Common Stock is
registered pursuant to Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act, and the
Company has taken no action designed to, or which to its knowledge is likely
to have the effect of, terminating the registration of the Common Stock under
the Exchange Act nor has the Company received any notification that the
Commission is contemplating terminating such registration. The Company has
not, in the 12 months preceding the date hereof, received notice from any
Trading Market on which the Common Stock is or has been listed or quoted to
the effect that the Company is not in compliance with the listing or
maintenance requirements of such Trading Market. The Company is, and has no
reason to believe that it will not in the foreseeable future continue to be,
in compliance with all such listing and maintenance requirements.

(x) _Application of Takeover Protections_. The Company and its board of
directors have taken all necessary action, if any, in order to render
inapplicable any control share acquisition, business combination, poison pill
(including any distribution under a rights agreement) or other similar anti-
takeover provision under the Companys certificate of incorporation (or
similar charter documents) or the laws of its state of incorporation that is
or could become applicable to the Purchasers as a result of the Purchasers
and the Company fulfilling their obligations or exercising their rights under
the Transaction Documents, including without limitation as a result of the
Companys issuance of the Securities and the Purchasers ownership of the
Securities.

(y) _Disclosure_. Except with respect to the material terms and conditions of
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and the matters
set forth in Exhibit D, the Company confirms that neither it nor any other
Person acting on its behalf has provided any of the Purchasers or their agents
or counsel with any information that it believes constitutes or might
constitute material, non-public information.

(z) _No Integrated Offering_. Assuming the accuracy of the Purchasers
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.2, neither the Company,
nor any of its Affiliates, nor any Person acting on its or their behalf has,
directly or indirectly, made any offers or sales of any security or solicited
any offers to buy any security, under circumstances that would, to the
Companys knowledge, cause this offering of the Securities to be integrated
with prior offerings by the Company for purposes of the Securities Act or any
applicable shareholder approval provisions of any Trading Market on which any
of the securities of the Company are listed or designated.

 



\- 15 -  (aa) _Solvency_. Based on the financial condition of the Company as of the
First Closing Date, after giving effect to the receipt by the Company of the
proceeds from the sale of the Securities hereunder, (i) the fair saleable
value of the Companys assets exceeds the amount that will be required to be
paid on or in respect of the Companys existing debts and other liabilities
(including known contingent liabilities) as they mature; (ii) the Companys
assets do not constitute unreasonably small capital to carry on its business
as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted including its capital needs
taking into account the particular capital requirements of the business
conducted by the Company, and projected capital requirements and capital
availability thereof; and (iii) the current cash flow of the Company,
together with the proceeds the Company would receive, were it to liquidate all
of its assets, after taking into account all anticipated uses of the cash,
would be sufficient to pay all amounts on or in respect of its liabilities
when such amounts are required to be paid. Assuming the First Closing occurs,
the Company has no knowledge of any facts or circumstances which lead it to
believe that it will file for reorganization or liquidation under
the bankruptcy or reorganization laws of any jurisdiction within one year
from the First Closing Date.

(bb) _Tax Status_. Except for matters that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
the Company and each Subsidiary has filed all necessary federal, state and
foreign income and franchise tax returns and has paid or accrued all taxes
shown as due thereon, and the Company has no knowledge of a tax deficiency
which has been asserted or threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary.

 

(cc) _No General Solicitation_. Neither the Company nor any person acting on
behalf of the Company has offered or sold any of the Securities by any form
of general solicitation or general advertising. The Company has offered the
Securities for sale only to the Purchasers and certain other "accredited
investors" within the meaning of Rule 501 under the Securities Act. 

(dd) _Foreign Corrupt Practices_. Neither the Company, nor to the knowledge of
the Company, any agent or other person acting on behalf of the Company, has
(i) directly or indirectly, used any funds for unlawful contributions, gifts,
entertainment or other unlawful expenses related to foreign or domestic
political activity, (ii) made any unlawful payment to foreign or domestic
government officials or employees or to any foreign or domestic political
parties or campaigns from corporate funds, (iii) failed to disclose fully any
contribution made by the Company (or made by any person acting on its behalf
of which the Company is aware) which is in violation of law, or (iv) violated
in any material respect any provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977, as amended.

knowledge and belief of the Company, such accounting firm is a registered
public accounting firm as required by the Exchange Act.

(ff) _No Disagreements with Accountants and Lawyers_. There are no
disagreements of any kind presently existing, or reasonably anticipated by the
Company to arise, between the Company and the accountants and lawyers
presently employed by the Company or who have been employed by the Company
during the prior 12 months from the date of this Agreement.

 



\- 16 -  (gg) _Acknowledgment Regarding Purchasers  Purchase of Securities_. The
Company acknowledges and agrees that each of the Purchasers is acting solely
in the capacity of an arms length purchaser with respect to the Transaction
Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby. The Company further
acknowledges that no Purchaser is acting as a financial advisor or fiduciary
of the Company (or in any similar capacity) with respect to the Transaction
Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby and any advice given by
any Purchaser or any of their respective representatives or agents in
connection with the Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated
thereby is merely incidental to the Purchasers purchase of the Securities.
The Company further represents to each Purchaser that the Companys decision
to enter into this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents has been
based solely on the independent evaluation of the transactions contemplated
hereby by the Company and its representatives.

 

(hh) _Regulation M Compliance_. The Company has not, and to its knowledge no
one acting on its behalf has, (i) taken, directly or indirectly, any action
designed to cause or to result in the stabilization or manipulation of the
price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of any
of the Securities, (ii) sold, bid for, purchased, or, paid any compensation
for soliciting purchases of, any of the Securities, or (iii) paid or agreed to
pay to any Person any compensation for soliciting another to purchase any
other securities of the Company, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii), compensation paid to the Companys placement agent in connection with
the placement of the Securities.

(ii) _FDA_. To the Companys knowledge, there is no pending, completed or
threatened, action (including any lawsuit, arbitration, or legal or
administrative or regulatory proceeding, charge, complaint, or investigation)
against the Company or its Subsidiary, and neither the Company or its

Subsidiary, (ii) enters or proposes to enter into a consent decree of
permanent injunction with the Company or its Subsidiary, or (iii) otherwise

FDA that the FDA will prohibit the marketing, sale, license or use in the
United States of any product proposed to be developed, produced or marketed by
the Company.

of this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement and, if required under
the terms of such arrangement, such Purchaser may transfer pledged or secured
Securities to the pledgees or secured parties. Such a pledge or transfer
would not be subject to approval of the Company and no legal opinion of legal
counsel of the pledgee, secured party or pledgor shall be required in
connection therewith. Further, no notice shall be required of such pledge. At
the appropriate Purchasers expense, the Company will execute and deliver such
reasonable documentation as a pledgee or secured party of Securities may
reasonably request in connection with a pledge or transfer of the Securities,
including, if the Securities are subject to registration pursuant to the
Registration Rights Agreement, the preparation and filing of any required
prospectus supplement under Rule 424(b)(3) under the Securities Act or other
applicable provision of the Securities Act to appropriately amend the list of
Selling Stockholders thereunder.

(c) Certificates evidencing the Shares and Warrant Shares shall not contain
any legend (including the legend set forth in Section 4.1(b)), (i) while a
registration statement (including the Registration Statement) covering the
resale of such security is effective under the Securities Act, or (ii)
following any sale of such Shares or Warrant Shares pursuant to Rule 144, or
(iii) if such Shares or Warrant Shares are eligible for sale under Rule 144,
or (iv) if such legend is not required under applicable requirements of the
Securities Act (including judicial interpretations and pronouncements issued
by the staff of the Commission). The Company shall cause its counsel to issue
a legal opinion to the Transfer Agent promptly after the Effective Date
if required by the Transfer Agent to effect the removal of the legend
hereunder. If all or any portion of a Warrant is exercised at a time when
there is an effective registration statement to cover the resale of the
Warrant Shares, such Warrant Shares shall be issued free of all legends. The
Company agrees that following the Effective Date or at such time as such
legend is no longer required under this Section 4.1(c), it will, no later than
three Trading Days following the 

 



\- 22 -   delivery by a Purchaser to the Company or the Transfer Agent of a
certificate representing Shares or Warrant Shares, as the case may be, issued
with a restrictive legend (such third Trading Day, the " _Legend Removal
Date_ "), deliver or cause to be delivered to such Purchaser a certificate
representing such shares that is free from all restrictive and other legends.
The Company may not make any notation on its records or give instructions to
the Transfer Agent that enlarge the restrictions on transfer set forth in this
Section. Certificates for Securities subject to legend removal hereunder shall
be transmitted by the Transfer Agent to the Purchasers by crediting
the account of the Purchasers prime broker with the Depository Trust Company
System, if the Transfer Agent is a participant in the DWAC system, and
otherwise by physical delivery of certificates as directed by the Purchaser.

 

(d) Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly with the other Purchasers,
agrees that the removal of the restrictive legend from certificates
representing Securities as set forth in this Section 4.1 is predicated upon
the Companys reliance that the Purchaser will sell any Securities pursuant to
either the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including any
applicable prospectus delivery requirements, or an exemption therefrom, and
that if Securities are sold pursuant to a Registration Statement, they will be
sold in compliance with the plan of distribution set forth therein.

 

4.2 _Furnishing of Information_. For a period of one year after the date of
this Agreement, the Company covenants to timely file (or obtain extensions in
respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports
required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to the
Exchange Act. During this one-year period, if the Company is not required to
file reports pursuant to the Exchange Act, it will prepare and furnish to the
Purchasers and make publicly available in accordance with Rule 144 such
information as is required for the Purchasers to sell the Securities under
Rule 144. The Company further covenants that it will take such further action
as any holder of Securities may reasonably request, to the extent required
from time to time to enable such Person to sell such Securities without
registration under the Securities Act within the requirements of the
exemption provided by Rule 144.

4.3 _Integration_. The Company shall not sell, offer for sale or solicit
offers to buy or otherwise negotiate in respect of any security (as defined in
Section 2 of the Securities Act) that could reasonably be expected to be
integrated with the offer or sale of the Securities in a manner that would
require the registration under the Securities Act of the sale of the
Securities to the Purchasers or that would be integrated with the offer or
sale of the Securities for purposes of the rules and regulations of any
Trading Market such that it would require shareholder approval prior to the
closing of such other transaction unless shareholder approval is obtained
before the closing of such subsequent transaction.

4.4 _Securities Laws Disclosure; Publicity_. The Company shall, by 8:30 a.m.
(New York City time) on the third Trading Day immediately following the date
hereof, issue a Current Report on Form 8-K, disclosing the material terms of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and filing the Transaction Documents as
exhibits thereto. The Company and each Purchaser shall consult with each other
in issuing any other press releases with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and neither the Company nor any Purchaser shall issue any
such press release or otherwise make any such public statement without the
prior consent of the Company, 

 



\- 23 -   with respect to any press release of any Purchaser, or without the prior
consent of each Purchaser, with respect to any press release of the Company,
which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, except if such
disclosure is required by law, in which case the disclosing party shall
promptly provide the other party with prior notice of such public statement or
communication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not publicly
disclose the name of any Purchaser, or include the name of any Purchaser in
any filing with the Commission or any regulatory agency or Trading Market,
without the prior written consent of such Purchaser, except (i) as required
by federal securities law in connection with (A) any registration statement
contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement and (B) the filing of final
Transaction Documents (including signature pages thereto) with the Commission
and (ii) to the extent such disclosure is required by law or Trading Market
regulations, in which case the Company shall provide the Purchasers with prior
notice of such disclosure permitted under this clause (ii).

 

4.5 _Indemnification of Purchasers_.

(a) In addition to the indemnity provided in the Registration Rights
Agreement, the Company will indemnify and hold each Purchaser and its
directors, officers, stockholders, members, partners, employees and agents
(and any other Persons with a functionally equivalent role of a Person holding
such titles notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title), each
Person who controls such Purchaser (within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), and the directors,
officers, stockholders, agents, members, partners or employees (and any other
Persons with a functionally equivalent role of a Person holding such titles
notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title) of such controlling
person (each, a "Purchaser Party") harmless from any and all losses,
liabilities, obligations, claims, contingencies, damages, costs and expenses,
including all judgments, amounts paid in settlements, court costs and
reasonable attorneys fees and costs of investigation that any such Purchaser
Party may suffer or incur as a result of any breach of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by the Company in
this Agreement or in the other Transaction Documents. The Company will not be
liable to any Purchaser Party under this Agreement to the extent, but only to
the extent that a loss, claim, damage or liability is attributable to
any Purchaser Partys breach of any of the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements made by such Purchaser Party in this Agreement or in
the other Transaction Documents; provided that such a claim for
indemnification relating to any breach of any of the representations or
warranties made by the Company in this Agreement is made within one year from
the Closing

(b) Promptly after receipt by any Person (the "Indemnified Person") of notice
of any demand, claim or circumstances which would or might give rise to a
claim or the commencement of any action, proceeding or investigation in
respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 4.5(a), such
Indemnified Person shall promptly notify the Company in writing and the
Company shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, and shall assume the
payment of all fees and expenses; provided, however, that the failure of any
Indemnified Person so to notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of
its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Company is actually
and materially and adversely prejudiced by such failure to notify. In any such
proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own
counsel, but the 

 



\- 24 -   fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such
Indemnified Person unless: (i) the Company and the Indemnified Person shall
have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel; (ii) the Company shall
have failed promptly to assume the defense of such proceeding and to employ
counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person in such proceeding;
or (iii) in the reasonable judgment of counsel to such Indemnified Person,
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due
to actual or potential differing interests between them. The Company shall not
be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. Without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, the
Company shall not effect any settlement of any pending or threatened
proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a
party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified
Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such proceeding.

4.6 _Reservation of Common Stock_. As of the date hereof, the Company has
reserved and the Company shall continue to reserve and keep available at all
times, free of preemptive rights, a sufficient number of shares of Common
Stock for the purpose of enabling the Company to issue Shares pursuant to
this Agreement and Warrant Shares pursuant to any exercise of the Warrants.

4.7  _Listing of Common Stock_. The Company hereby agrees to use best efforts
to maintain the listing of the Common Stock on a Trading Market, and as soon
as reasonably practicable following the Closing (but not later than the
earlier of the Effective Date and the first anniversary of the Closing Date)
to list all of the Shares and Warrant Shares on such Trading Market. The
Company further agrees, if the Company applies to have the Common Stock traded
on any other Trading Market, it will include in such application all of the
Shares and Warrant Shares, and will take such other action as is necessary to
cause all of the Shares and Warrant Shares to be listed on such other Trading
Market as promptly as possible. The Company will take all action reasonably
necessary to continue the listing and trading of its Common Stock on a Trading
Market and will comply in all respects with the Companys reporting, filing
and other obligations under the bylaws or rules of the Trading Market.

4.8 _Equal Treatment of Purchasers_. No consideration shall be offered or paid
to any Person to amend or consent to a waiver or modification of any
provision of any of the Transaction Documents unless the same consideration is
also offered to all of the parties to the Transaction Documents. For
clarification purposes, this provision constitutes a separate right granted
to each Purchaser by the Company and negotiated separately by each Purchaser,
and is intended for the Company to treat the Purchasers as a class and shall
not in any way be construed as the Purchasers acting in concert or as a
group with respect to the purchase, disposition or voting of Securities or
otherwise.

4.9 _Short Sales and Confidentiality After The Date Hereof_. Each Purchaser
severally and not jointly with the other Purchasers covenants that neither it
nor any Affiliate acting on its behalf or pursuant to any understanding with
it will execute any Short Sales during the period commencing at the
Discussion Time and ending at the time that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are first publicly announced as described in Section 4.4, and
such further time as 

 



\- 25 -   Purchaser remains in possession of material non-public information related
to the Company. Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly with the other
Purchasers, covenants that until such time as the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and such other material non-public information related to
the Company in possession of the Purchaser are publicly disclosed by the
Company as described in Section 4.4, such Purchaser will maintain the
confidentiality of all disclosures made to it in connection with this
transaction (including the existence and terms of this transaction). Each
Purchaser understands and acknowledges, severally and not jointly with any
other Purchaser, that the Commission currently takes the position that
coverage of short sales of shares of the Common Stock "against the box" prior
to the Effective Date of the Registration Statement with the Securities is a
violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act, as set forth in Item 65,
Section A, of the Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations,
dated July 1997, compiled by the Office of Chief Counsel, Division of
Corporation Finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a
Purchaser that is a multi-managed investment vehicle whereby separate
portfolio managers manage separate portions of such Purchasers assets and the
portfolio managers have no direct knowledge of the investment decisions made
by the portfolio managers managing other portions of such Purchasers assets,
the covenant set forth above shall only apply with respect to the portion of
assets managed by the portfolio manager that made the investment decision to
purchase the Securities covered by this Agreement.

4.10 _Delivery of Securities After Closing_. The Company shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered, the respective Securities purchased by each Purchaser
to such Purchaser within three (3) Trading Days of the applicable Closing
Date.

4.11 _Form D; Blue Sky Filings_. The Company agrees to timely file a Form D
with respect to the Securities as required under Regulation D and to provide a
copy thereof, promptly upon request of any Purchaser. The Company shall take
such action as the Company shall reasonably determine is necessary in order to
obtain an exemption for, or to qualify the Securities for, sale to the
Purchasers at the applicable Closing under applicable securities or " _Blue
Sky_ " laws of the states of the United States, and shall provide evidence of
such actions promptly upon request of any Purchaser.

ARTICLE V

MISCELLANEOUS

 

5.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the sale and purchase
of the Shares and Warrants abandoned at any time prior to the Closing by
either the Company or any Purchaser (with respect to itself only) upon written
notice to the other, if the Closing has not been consummated on or prior to
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Outside Date; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 5.1 shall not
be available to any Person whose failure to comply with its obligations under
this Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing
to occur on or before such time. Nothing in this Section 5.1 shall be deemed
to release any party from any liability for any breach by such party of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or
to impair the right of any party to compel specific performance by any other
party of its obligations under this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents. In the event of a termination pursuant to this Section, the Company
shall promptly notify all non-terminating Purchasers. Upon a termination in
accordance with this Section, the Company and the terminating Purchaser(s)
shall not have any further obligation or liability (including arising from
such termination) to the other, and no Purchaser will have any liability to
any other Purchaser under the Transaction Documents as a result therefrom.

 



\- 26 -  5.2 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth in the Transaction
Documents to the contrary, each party shall pay the fees and expenses of its
advisers, counsel, accountants and other experts, if any, and all other
expenses incurred by such party incident to the negotiation, preparation,
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement. The Company shall pay
all Transfer Agent fees, stamp taxes and other taxes and duties levied in
connection with the delivery of any Securities to the Purchasers.

 

5.3 _Entire Agreement_. The Transaction Documents, together with the exhibits
and schedules thereto, contain the entire understanding of the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters, which the
parties acknowledge have been merged into such documents, exhibits and
schedules. At or after the Closing, and without further consideration, the
Company and the Purchasers will execute and deliver to the other such further
documents as may be reasonably requested in order to give practical effect to
the intention of the parties under the Transaction Documents.

5.4 _Notices_. Any and all notices or other communications or
deliveries required or permitted to be provided hereunder shall be in writing
and shall be deemed given and effective on the earliest of (a) the date of
transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered via facsimile at
the facsimile number set forth on the signature pages attached hereto prior
to 5:30 p.m. (New York City time) on a Trading Day, (b) the next Trading Day
after the date of transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered

attached hereto on a day that is not a Trading Day or later than 5:30 p.m.
(New York City time) on any Trading Day, (c) the 2nd Trading Day following the
date of mailing, if sent by U.S. nationally recognized overnight courier
service, or (d) upon actual receipt by the party to whom such notice is
required to be given. The address for such notices and communications shall be

5.5 _Amendments; Waivers_. No provision of this Agreement may be waived or
amended except in a written instrument signed, in the case of an amendment,
by the Company and each of the Purchasers holding or having the right to
acquire a majority of the Securities on a fully-diluted basis at the time of
such amendment or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against
whom enforcement of any such waiver is sought. No waiver of any default with
respect to any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement shall be
deemed to be a continuing waiver in the future or a waiver of any subsequent
default or a waiver of any other provision, condition or requirement hereof,
nor shall any delay or omission of either party to exercise any right
hereunder in any manner impair the exercise of any such right. No
consideration shall be offered or paid to any Purchaser to amend or consent
to a waiver or modification of any provision of any Transaction Document
unless the same consideration is also offered to all Purchasers who then hold
Securities.

 



\- 27 -  5.6 _Headings and Construction_. The headings herein are for convenience only,
do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit
or affect any of the provisions hereof The language used in this Agreement
will be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their
mutual intent, and no rules of strict construction will be applied against
any party. This Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents.

5.7 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns. The
Company may not assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of each Purchaser (other than by merger).
Any Purchaser may assign any or all of its rights under this Agreement to any
Person to whom such Purchaser assigns or transfers any Securities, provided
such transferee agrees in writing to be bound, with respect to the
transferred Securities, by the provisions of the Transaction Documents that
apply to the " _Purchasers_."

5.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is intended for the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns and is not for the benefit of, nor may any provision hereof be
enforced by, any other Person, except as otherwise set forth in Section 4.9.

5.9 _Governing Law_. All questions concerning the construction, validity,
enforcement and interpretation of the Transaction Documents shall be governed
by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the
State of New York, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law
thereof. Each party agrees that all legal proceedings concerning the
interpretations, enforcement and defense of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and any other Transaction Documents (whether brought against a
party hereto or its respective affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders,
employees or agents) shall be commenced exclusively in the state and federal
courts sitting in the City of New York. Each party hereby irrevocably submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the
City of New York, borough of Manhattan for the adjudication of any dispute
hereunder or in connection herewith or with any transaction contemplated
hereby or discussed herein (including with respect to the enforcement of any
of the Transaction Documents), and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not
to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that such suit,
action or proceeding is improper or is an inconvenient venue for such
proceeding. Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process
and consents to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by
mailing a copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery
(with evidence of delivery) to such party at the address in effect for notices
to it under this Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good
and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any
other manner permitted by law.

 

5.10 _Survival_. The representations and warranties contained herein shall
survive the Closing and the delivery of the Shares and Warrant Shares.

5.11 _Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,
all of which when taken together shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by
each party and delivered to the other party, it

 



\- 28 -   being understood that both parties need not sign the same counterpart. In
the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or by
e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, such signature shall create a
valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such
signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or
".pdf" signature page were an original thereof.

5.12 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions set forth herein shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the
parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to find and
employ an alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same
result as that contemplated by such term, provision, covenant or restriction.
It is hereby stipulated and declared to be the intention of the parties that
they would have executed the remaining terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions without including any of such that may be hereafter declared
invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable.

5.13 _Rescission and Withdrawal Right_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in (and without limiting any similar provisions of) any of
the other Transaction Documents, whenever any Purchaser exercises a right,
election, demand or option under a Transaction Document and the Company does
not timely and materially perform its related obligations within the periods
therein provided, then such Purchaser may rescind or withdraw, in its sole
discretion from time to time upon written notice to the Company, any relevant
notice, demand or election in whole or in part without prejudice to its
future actions and rights; _provided_ , _however_ , in the case of a
rescission of an exercise of a Warrant, the Purchaser shall be required to
return any shares of Common Stock delivered in connection with any such
rescinded exercise notice.

5.14 _Replacement of Securities_. If any certificate or instrument evidencing
any Securities is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company shall
issue or cause to be issued in exchange and substitution for and upon
cancellation thereof, or in lieu of and substitution therefor, a new
certificate or instrument, but only upon receipt of evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Transfer Agent of such loss,
theft or destruction and the execution by the holder thereof of a customary
lost certificate affidavit of that fact and an agreement to indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and the Transfer Agent for any losses in connection
therewith or, if required by the Transfer Agent, a bond in such form and
amount as is required by the Transfer Agent. The applicants for a new
certificate or instrument under such circumstances shall also pay any
reasonable third-party costs associated with the issuance of such replacement
Securities. If a replacement certificate or instrument evidencing any
Securities is requested due to a mutilation thereof, the Company may require
delivery of such mutilated certificate or instrument as a condition precedent
to any issuance of a replacement.

5.15 _Remedies_. In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights
provided herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, each of the
Purchasers and the Company will be entitled to specific performance under the
Transaction Documents. The parties agree that monetary damages may not be
adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of any breach of
obligations contained in the Transaction Documents and hereby agrees to waive
and not to assert in any action for specific performance of any such
obligation the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

 



\- 29 -  5.16 _Payment Set Aside_. To the extent that the Company makes a payment or
payments to any Purchaser pursuant to any Transaction Document or a Purchaser
enforces or exercises its rights thereunder, and such payment or payments or
the proceeds of such enforcement or exercise or any part thereof are
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set
aside, recovered from, disgorged by or are required to be refunded, repaid or
otherwise restored to the Company, a trustee, receiver or any other person
under any law (including, without limitation, any bankruptcy law, state or
federal law, common law or equitable cause of action), then to the extent of
any such restoration the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be
satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if
such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not
occurred.

5.17 _Independent Nature of Purchasers  Obligations and Rights_. The
obligations of each Purchaser under any Transaction Document are several and
not joint with the obligations of any other Purchaser, and no Purchaser shall
be responsible in any way for the performance or non-performance of the
obligations of any other Purchaser under any Transaction Document. Nothing
contained herein or in any other Transaction Document, and no action taken by
any Purchaser pursuant thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Purchasers
as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity,
or create a presumption that the Purchasers are in any way acting in concert
or as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents. Each Purchaser shall be entitled
to independently protect and enforce its rights, including without limitation,
the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other Transaction
Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any other Purchaser to be joined
as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. Each Purchaser has
been represented by its own separate legal counsel in their review and
negotiation of the Transaction Documents.

 

5.18 _Liquidated Damages_. The Companys obligations to pay any partial
liquidated damages or other amounts owing under the Transaction Documents is
a continuing obligation of the Company and shall not terminate until all
unpaid partial liquidated damages and other amounts have been paid
notwithstanding the fact that the instrument or security pursuant to which
such partial liquidated damages or other amounts are due and payable shall
have been canceled.

5.19 _Construction_. The parties agree that each of them and/or their
respective counsel has reviewed and had an opportunity to revise the
Transaction Documents and, therefore, the normal rule of construction to the
effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party
shall not be employed in the interpretation of the Transaction Documents or
any amendments hereto.

5.20  _Exculpation Among Purchasers_. Each Purchaser acknowledges that it is
not relying upon any person, firm or corporation (including without limitation
any other Purchaser), other than the Company and its officers and directors
(acting in their capacity as representatives of the Company), in deciding to
invest and in making its investment in the Company. Each Purchaser agrees that
no other Purchaser nor the respective controlling persons, officers,
directors, partners, agents or employees of any other Purchaser shall be
liable to such Purchaser for any losses incurred by such Purchaser in
connection with its investment in the Company.

 



\- 30 -  5.21 _Company Acknowledgement_. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i)
each of the Purchasers is participating in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents at the Companys request
and the Company has concluded that such participation is in the Companys best
interest and is consistent with the Companys objectives and (ii) each of the
Purchasers is acting solely in the capacity of an arms length purchaser. The
Company further acknowledges that no Purchaser is acting or has acted as an
advisor, agent or fiduciary of the Company (or in any similar capacity) with
respect to this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents and any advice
given by any Purchaser or any of its respective representatives in connection
with this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents is merely incidental
to the Purchasers purchase of Shares and Warrants. The Company further
represents to each Purchaser that the Companys decision to enter into this
Agreement has been based solely on the independent evaluation of the
transactions contemplated hereby by the Company and its representatives.

5.22 _Adjustments in Common Stock Numbers and Prices_. In the event of any
stock split, subdivision, dividend or distribution payable in shares of Common
Stock (or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder
thereof to receive directly or indirectly shares of Common Stock),
combination or other similar recapitalization or event occurring after the
date hereof and prior to the Closing, each reference in any Transaction
Document to a number of shares or a price per share shall be deemed to be
amended to appropriately account for such event.

5.23 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Each party to this Agreement acknowledges that
Company Counsel, outside general counsel to the Company, has in the past
performed and is or may now or in the future represent one or more Purchasers
or their affiliates in matters unrelated to the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents, including representation of such Purchasers or
their affiliates in matters of a similar nature to the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents. The applicable rules of
professional conduct require that Company Counsel inform the parties
hereunder of this representation and obtain their consent. Company Counsel has
served as outside general counsel to the Company and has negotiated the terms
of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents solely on
behalf of the Company. The Company and each Purchaser hereby (a) acknowledge
that they have had an opportunity to ask for and have obtained information
relevant to such representation, including disclosure of the
reasonably foreseeable adverse consequences of such representation; (b)
acknowledge that with respect to the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents, Company Counsel has represented solely the Company, and
not any Purchaser or any stockholder, director or employee of the Company or
any Purchaser; and (c) gives its informed consent to Company Counsels
representation of the Company in the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents.
