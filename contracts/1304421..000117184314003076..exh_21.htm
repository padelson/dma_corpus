hereinafter referred to as the "Excluded Shares"; and

  

  

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall (subject to Section
2.1(d)) be converted into and become the right to receive 0.7402 (the
"Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the "Parent Stock"),
subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 2.1(d) (such per share
amount, together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock to
be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(c), is hereinafter referred to as the "Merger
Consideration"). Effective as of the Effective Time, each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Excluded Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and (A) each
certificate formerly representing any of the shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Excluded Shares) and (B) each uncertificated Share (an
"Uncertificated Share") registered to a holder on the stock transfer books of
the Company (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, (each a "Certificate") shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance
with Section 3.4.

  

  

(c) No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be issued
in respect of shares of Company Common Stock that are to be converted in the
Merger into the right to receive shares of Parent Stock. Each holder of a
Certificate (other than holders of Certificates representing Excluded Shares)
shall be entitled to receive in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Stock
to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled pursuant to Section
2.1(b) an amount in cash (without interest), rounded to the nearest whole
cent, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share of
Parent Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking
into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time) by (ii) the last reported sale price
of Parent Stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market (as reported in The Wall Street
Journal or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually
selected by the Company and Parent) on the last complete trading day prior to
the date of the Effective Time.

(d) Adjustments. If, on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, Parent splits, combines into a smaller number of shares, or
issues by reclassification, any shares of Parent Stock, then the Merger
Consideration and any dependent items shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, and as so adjusted shall,
from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration or other
dependent item, as applicable, subject to further adjustment in accordance
with this sentence.

  

  

2.2 Effect on Capital Stock of Merger Sub. At and after the Effective Time,
each share of common stock, no par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
(1) fully paid share of common stock, no par value, of the Surviving Company
and constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Company and shall not be effected by the Merger.

  

  

2.3 Treatment of Options and Other Stock-Based Awards.

  

  

(a) At least 10 days prior to the Effective Time, the Company will provide
notice to each holder of an option to purchase shares of Common Stock under
any Company Stock Plan (each a "Company Option"), that all outstanding Company
Options, whether or not exercisable, will be cancelled as of the Effective
Time in exchange for payment of cash equal to the amount (if any) for each
share of Company stock covered by the Company Option, by which the Merger
Consideration (calculated using a five-day average of the Parent Stock closing
price prior to the Effective Time) exceeds the exercise price per share
covered by such Company Option. As of the date of the notice, each Company
Option shall become exercisable in full prior to the date of cancellation as
to any part or all of such Company Option. Any restrictions applicable to
Restricted Stock issued under a Company Stock Plan shall be immediately lapsed
as of the Effective Time and shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration
described above (including Restricted Stock held by a rabbi trustee or
custodian).

  

  

(b) On or before the Effective Time, any Awards granted under the HickoryTech
Corporation Long-Term Executive Incentive Program ("LTIP") shall be amended by
the Company Compensation Committee to provide that for each outstanding Award
as of the Effective Time, the Participant shall, as of the end of each year of
the Program Period for such Award, be deemed to meet the target objective for
the performance period ending in such year and will be 100% vested in the
Award for that applicable Program Period if the Participant is employed on the
last day of the Program Period. Subject to any Change of Control Agreement,
vested Awards will be paid no later than March 15 of the year following the
close of the Performance Period. All payments of Awards will be made in shares
of Parent Stock.

3. EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES FOR MERGER CONSIDERATION

  

  

3.1 Delivery of the Merger Consideration. Prior to the Effective Time and,
from time to time after the Effective Time, as applicable, Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, pursuant to an agreement providing for the
matters set forth in this Section 3.1 and such other matters as may be
appropriate and the terms of which shall be mutually acceptable to Parent and
the Company, an amount in cash in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Stock
to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and certificates representing shares of
Parent Stock sufficient to effect the conversion of each share of Company
Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

3.2 Exchange Procedures.

  

  

(a) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall designate and
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
exchange agent hereunder (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging
Certificates.

  

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event not more than five (5)
Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
of shares of Company Common Stock (each such holder, a "Company Common Stock
Holder"), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to each Certificate representing any
shares of Company Common Stock held by such Company Common Stock Holder shall
pass, only upon delivery of the completed letter of transmittal and such
Certificate to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company shall mutually agree) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of each such Certificate in
exchange for the total amount of Merger Consideration that such Company Common
Stock Holder is entitled to receive in exchange for such holder's shares of
Company Common Stock in the Merger pursuant to this Agreement. From and after
the Effective Time, until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2,
each Certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock held by a Company
Common Stock Holder shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive the
total amount of Merger Consideration to which such Company Common Stock Holder
is entitled in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock as
contemplated by Section 2.

  

  

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to (i) mail to each holder of Uncertificated Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) materials advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and
the conversion of their Shares into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and (ii) issue in registered form to each holder of
Uncertificated Shares that number of whole shares of Parent Stock that such
holder is entitled to receive in respect of each such Uncertificated Share
pursuant to this Agreement, cash in lieu of fractional shares in respect of
each such Uncertificated Share and any dividends and other distributions in
respect of the Parent Stock to be issued or paid pursuant to Section 3.3.

  

  

(d) Upon surrender by a Company Common Stock Holder to the Exchange Agent of
all Certificates representing such holder's shares of Company Common Stock,
together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, each Company Common Stock Holder shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (and the Exchange Agent shall mail
to such Company Common Stock Holder within ten (10) Business Days following
such surrender): (i) a certificate (or certificates in the aggregate)
representing the number of whole shares of Parent Stock, if any, into which
such holder's shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder's
properly surrendered Certificates were converted in accordance with Section 2,
and such Certificates so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled, and (ii) a
check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any required
withholdings pursuant to Section 3.7) equal to (A) the amount of cash in lieu
of a fractional share of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(c)),
if any, into which such holder's shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such holder's properly surrendered Certificates were converted in accordance
with Section 2, plus (B) any cash dividends and other distributions that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.3.

3.3 Dividends and Distributions. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to shares of Parent Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate is surrendered as provided in
this Section 3. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following such
surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the
shares of Parent Stock issued in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock
represented immediately prior to the Effective Time by such Certificate (i)
when any payment or distribution of a certificate representing any share(s) of
Parent Stock is made to such holder pursuant to Section 3.2(b) or (c), all
dividends and other distributions payable in respect of such Parent Stock with
a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the
date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) on the appropriate
payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
such Parent Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes
of dividends and other distributions in respect of Parent Stock, all shares of
Parent Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to
dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time.

  

  

3.4 Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. After the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall
be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on
the records of the Company. After the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and such dividends and
other distributions on or in respect of Parent Stock as provided herein or as
otherwise provided by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in Section 2.

  

  

3.5 Termination of Fund; No Liability. At any time following twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent (i) certificates representing shares of
Parent Stock and (ii) cash held by the Exchange Agent for payments in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Stock, in each case, not delivered to holders of
Certificates. Thereafter, holders of Certificates shall be entitled to look
only to Parent, which shall thereafter act as the Exchange Agent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors of
Parent with respect to the delivery of the Merger Consideration (including
payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock). None of Parent,
the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for
any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

3.6 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit
attesting to that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if requested by Parent or the Surviving Company, the
delivery by such Person of a bond (in such amount as Parent or the Surviving
Company may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Company on account of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a
certificate representing shares of Parent Stock and/or pay the cash in lieu of
any fractional share of Parent Stock to which such holder is entitled, which
constitute the total amount of Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of
such Certificate as determined in accordance with Section 2.

  

  

3.7 Withholding Taxes. Parent or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of Company
Common Stock such amounts as Parent, or any affiliate (as defined under the
Exchange Act (an "Affiliate")) thereof, or the Exchange Agent are required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any applicable
provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent
that such amounts are properly withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent and
paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding
were made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.

  

  

3.8 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. Without limiting the other provisions of
the Agreement, in the event that the Company changes the number of shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration and other outstanding equity awards of the Company shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

which it is organized (in the case of the good standing, to the extent such

Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has the

condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) a
material adverse effect on the Company's ability to consummate the

determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred, there
shall be excluded any effect on the Company or its Subsidiaries relating to or
arising in connection with (A) any adverse change, effect, event or
occurrence, state of facts or developments to the extent the public
announcement or the pendency of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or any actions required to be taken (or refrained from
being taken) in compliance herewith or otherwise with the consent of the other
party hereto, including the impact thereof on the relationships of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries with customers, suppliers, distributors,

earnings are released) on or after the date hereof (it being understood that
this clause (B) does not and shall not be deemed to apply to the underlying
cause or causes of any such failure), (C) any change in federal, state,
non-U.S. or local law, regulations, policies or procedures, or interpretations
thereof, generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") or regulatory
accounting requirements applicable or potentially applicable to the industries
in which the Company or its Subsidiaries operate, (D) changes generally
affecting the industries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries operate that
are not specifically related to the Company and its Subsidiaries and do not
have a materially disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (E) changes in economic conditions (including
changes in the prevailing interest rates) in the United States, in any region
thereof, or in any non-U.S. or global economy that do not have a materially
disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole or (F) any attack on, or by, outbreak or escalation of hostilities or
acts of terrorism involving, the United States, or any declaration of war by
the United States Congress or any hurricane or other natural disaster. As used

made available to Parent contain true, complete and correct records in all
material respects of all meetings and other material corporate actions held or
taken since January 1, 2012 of their respective shareholders, members,

any other equity securities of the Company or any securities representing the
right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of the Company capital stock

Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
own, directly or indirectly, any equity or similar interest in, or any
interest convertible into or exchangeable for, any equity or similar interest

and security interests whatsoever ("Liens"), and all of such shares are duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership
thereof. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has or is bound by

the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock entitled to vote (the "Company Required Vote"), no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to approve this Agreement
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub) constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by general
principles of equity whether applied in a court of law or a court of equity
and by bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and

any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, except
(in the case of clause (ii) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches,
defaults or other events which, either individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Company SEC Reports contained, when filed or, if amended or supplemented prior
to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment or supplement, any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they

after giving effect to any restatements made by the Company prior to the date
of this Agreement, fairly present in all material respects (subject, in the
case of the unaudited statements, to normal recurring adjustments, none of
which would be reasonably expected to result in, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect) the results of the consolidated
operations and changes in shareholders' equity and consolidated financial
position of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods
or as of the respective dates therein set forth. Each of such financial
statements (including the related notes, where applicable), after giving
effect to any restatements made by the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement, complies in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto and each of such financial statements (including the related
notes, where applicable) has been prepared in accordance with GAAP, as in
effect on the date or for the period with respect to which such principles are
applied, in all material respects consistently applied during the periods
involved, except in each case as indicated in such statements or in the notes
thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q.
The books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been, and are
being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any

of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described below
in this Section 4.6(b). The Company (i) has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in

information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer
of the Company by others within those entities and (ii) has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to the Company's
outside auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (A) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's
internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in
writing by management to the Company's auditors and audit committee and a copy
has previously been made available to Parent. The Company's disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
the management of the Company as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant
to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

obligation arising under common law standards relating to protection of the
environment or human health, or under any local, state or federal
environmental statute, regulation or ordinance, including the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended

management of any property, or (c) its or any of its Subsidiaries' holding of
a security interest or other interest in any property, there were no releases
or threatened releases of hazardous, toxic, radioactive or dangerous materials
or other materials regulated under Environmental Laws in, on, under or
affecting any such property which would reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or
memorandum by or with any Governmental Entity or third Person imposing any
material liability or obligation pursuant to or under any Environmental Law
that would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries are
in compliance with all Environmental Laws, including possessing all material
permits required for its currently conducted operations under applicable
Environmental Laws, except, in each case, for any such non-compliance that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary (including Section 4.12), the representations
and warranties of the Company in this Section 4.19 constitute the sole
representations and warranties of the Company with respect to any matter

property rights and any such rights in computer programs (collectively,
"Intellectual Property Rights") as used in their business as presently
conducted, except where the failure to have the right to use such Intellectual
Property Rights, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No actions,
suits or other proceedings are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened in writing that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the rights of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Intellectual Property Right
owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, expect for such infringement,
misappropriation or violation that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the representations and warranties of the Company
in this Section 4.20 constitute the sole representations and warranties of the
Company with respect to any matter (including any liability) relating to

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries hold (i) all approvals,
authorizations, certificates and licenses issued by the FCC or the State
Regulators that are required for the Company and each of its Subsidiary to
conduct its business as presently conducted, which approvals, authorizations,
certificates and licenses are set forth in Section 4.21(a) of the Company

that are required for the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to conduct its
business, as presently conducted (clause (i) and (ii) collectively, the
"Licenses").

  

  

(b) Each License is valid and in full force and effect and has not been
suspended, revoked, canceled or adversely modified, except where the failure
to be in full force and effect, or the suspension, revocation, cancellation or
modification of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. No License is subject
to (i) any conditions or requirements that have not been imposed generally
upon licenses in the same service, unless such conditions or requirements
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) any pending regulatory proceeding or
judicial review before a Governmental Entity, unless such pending regulatory
proceeding or judicial review would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the
Knowledge of the Company, there has been no event, condition or circumstance
that would preclude any License from being renewed in the ordinary course (to
the extent that such License is renewable by its terms), except where the
failure to be renewed would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(c) The licensee of each License is in compliance with each License and has
fulfilled and performed all of its obligations with respect thereto, including
all reports, notifications and applications required by the rules,
regulations, policies, instructions and orders of the FCC or the State
Regulators, and the payment of all regulatory fees and contributions, except
(i) for exemptions, waivers or similar concessions or allowances and (ii)
where such failure to be in compliance, fulfill or perform its obligations or
pay such fees or contributions would not reasonably be expected to have,

Company or any such Subsidiary to bargain with any labor organization as to
wages or conditions of employment, nor is there any strike or other material
labor dispute involving it or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, is
there any activity involving its or any of its Subsidiaries' employees seeking
to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in other organizational
activity. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no written labor or
employment-related charge, complaint or claim of any sort against the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,

Securities Act or the Exchange Act (excluding any disclosures set forth in any
section of any such report entitled "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking
Statements" or any other disclosures included in such filings to the extent
that they are forward-looking in nature) or (b) in the disclosure schedule of
Parent and Merger Sub delivered to the Company concurrently herewith (the
"Parent Disclosure Schedule") (with specific reference to the section of this
Agreement to which the information stated in such Parent Disclosure Schedule
relates; provided that (i) disclosure in any section of such Parent Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other Section of
this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of
such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable or relevant to such other
Section and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in such Parent Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed
an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item has had or would have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined)), Parent and Merger Sub
hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

  

  

5.1 Corporate Organization.

  

  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of its
incorporation. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the corporate power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business currently
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The copies of the
charter documents of Parent and Merger Sub which have previously been made
available to the Company are true, complete and correct copies of such
documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. As used in this
Agreement, a "Parent Material Adverse Effect" means (i) a material adverse
effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of Parent
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) a material adverse effect on
Parent's or Merger Sub's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby on a timely basis; provided, however, that in determining whether a
Parent Material Adverse Effect has occurred, there shall be excluded any
effect on the Parent or its Subsidiaries relating to or arising in connection
with (A) any adverse change, effect, event or occurrence, state of facts or
developments to the extent the public announcement or the pendency of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any actions required to
be taken (or refrained from being taken) in compliance herewith or otherwise
with the consent of the other party hereto, including the impact thereof on
the relationships of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with customers,
suppliers, distributors, consultants, employees or independent contractors or
other third parties with whom Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has any
relationship and including any litigation brought by any shareholder of the
Company or Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (B)
any failure by Parent to meet any projections or forecasts for any period
ending (or for which revenues or earnings are released) on or after the date
hereof (it being understood that this clause (B) does not and shall not be
deemed to apply to the underlying cause or causes of any such failure), (C)
any change in federal, state, non-U.S. or local law, regulations, policies or
procedures, or interpretations thereof, GAAP or regulatory accounting
requirements applicable or potentially applicable to the industries in which
Parent or its Subsidiaries operate, (D) changes generally affecting the
industries in which Parent or its Subsidiaries operate that are not
specifically related to Parent and its Subsidiaries and do not have a
materially disproportionate adverse effect on the Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (E) changes in economic conditions (including changes in the
prevailing interest rates) in the United States, in any region thereof, or in
any non-U.S. or global economy that do not have a materially disproportionate
adverse effect on the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (F) any
attack on, or by, outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism
involving, the United States, or any declaration of war by the United States
Congress or any hurricane or other natural disaster.

Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred

Parent's Common Stock outstanding and (ii) no shares of Parent's Preferred
Stock outstanding. As of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, no
shares of Parent Stock were reserved or to be made available for issuance,

of the issued and outstanding shares of Parent Stock have been duly authorized
and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive

the date of this Agreement, except (i) as set forth in Section 5.2(a) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, (ii) pursuant to any cashless exercise provisions
of any options or pursuant to the surrender of shares to Parent or the
withholding of shares by Parent to cover tax withholding obligations under

Parent Disclosure Schedule (collectively, and in each case as the same may be
amended to the date hereof, the "Parent Stock Plans"), and (iii) as set forth
elsewhere in this Section 5.2(a), Parent does not have and is not bound by any
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements
of any character calling for the purchase, sale, repurchase, redemption or
issuance of any shares of Parent Stock or any other equity securities of
Parent or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of the Parent capital stock (including any rights plan or
agreement). Since the Parent Capitalization Date, Parent has not (i) issued or
repurchased any shares of its capital stock or any securities convertible into
or exercisable for any shares of its capital stock, other than upon the
exercise of employee stock options granted prior to such date and disclosed in

withholding of shares by Parent to cover tax withholding obligations under the
Parent Stock Plans, or (ii) issued or awarded any options, restricted shares

neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries own, directly or indirectly, any
equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or
exchangeable for, any equity or similar interest in, any corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other similar business association or entity
(other than its wholly owned Subsidiaries), with respect to which securities
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has invested (and currently owns) or is
required to invest $3,000,000 or more. Except as set forth in Section 5.2(c)
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent owns, directly or indirectly, all of
the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of or all other equity
interests in each of Parent's Subsidiaries free and clear of any Liens and all
of such shares are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability
attaching to the ownership thereof. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase,
repurchase, sale, redemption or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any
other equity security of any Subsidiary of Parent or any securities
representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of any such Subsidiary. There are no
restrictions on the Parent with respect to voting the stock of any Subsidiary
of the Parent.

execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger,
have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of Parent
("Parent Board") and Merger Sub and no other corporate proceedings on the part
of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to approve this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, or
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and (assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company) constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent
and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be
limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-26-  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or Merger
Sub, nor the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger will (i) violate any provision of
charter documents of Parent or Merger Sub or (ii) assuming that the consents,
approvals and filings referred to in Section 5.4 are duly obtained or made,

lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, except (in the
case of clause (ii) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults
or other events which either individually or in the aggregate would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Disclosure Schedule, no Consents of, or filings or registrations with, any

5.5 SEC Filings. Parent has filed all forms, reports, statements,
certifications and other documents (including all exhibits, amendments and
supplements thereto) required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1,
2012 (collectively, the "Parent SEC Reports"). None of Parent's Subsidiaries
is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange
Act. Each of the Parent SEC Reports, as amended prior to the date of this
Agreement, complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, each as in effect on
the date so filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date
of this Agreement, then on the date of such subsequent filing). None of the
Parent SEC Reports contained, when filed or, if amended or supplemented prior
to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment or supplement, any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in
comment letters received from the SEC with respect to the Parent SEC Reports.
To the Knowledge of Parent, as of the date hereof, none of the Parent SEC
Reports is subject to ongoing SEC review. None of the Subsidiaries of Parent
is required to file or furnish reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange

5.6 Financial Statements.

  

  

(a) Each of the financial statements included (or incorporated by reference)
in the Parent SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable),
fairly present in all material respects (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal recurring adjustments, none of which would be reasonably
expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect) the results of the consolidated operations and changes in
shareholders' equity and consolidated financial position of Parent and its
Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates
therein set forth. Each of such financial statements (including the related
notes, where applicable), complies in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto and each of such financial statements (including the
related notes, where applicable) has been prepared in accordance with GAAP, as
in effect on the date or for the period with respect to which such principles
are applied, in all material respects consistently applied during the periods
involved, except in each case as indicated in such statements or in the notes
thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q.
The books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other
applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions.

(b) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the system of internal accounting controls described below in this
Section 5.6(b). Parent (i) has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) and internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act), including to ensure that material information relating to Parent,
including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within those
entities and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date hereof, to Parent's outside auditors and the audit committee of the
Parent Board (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Parent's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent's
internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in
writing by management to Parent's auditors and audit committee and a copy has
previously been made available to the Company. The Parent's disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by the Parent in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
the management of the Parent as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant
to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  

  

(c) From January 1, 2012 to the date of this Agreement, (i) neither the Parent
nor any Subsidiary of the Parent nor, to the Knowledge of Parent (as defined
below), any director, officer, auditor, accountant or representative of the
Parent or any of the Subsidiaries of the Parent has received any written
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Parent or any of the
Subsidiaries of the Parent has engaged in improper or illegal accounting or
auditing practices or maintains improper or inadequate internal accounting
controls relating to the Parent and the Subsidiaries of the Parent, taken as a
whole, (ii) no attorney representing the Parent or any Subsidiary of the
Parent has made a report to the Parent's chief legal officer, chief executive
officer or Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) pursuant to the SEC's
Standards of Professional Conduct for Attorneys (17 CFR Part 205), and (iii)
the Parent has disclosed to its outside auditors any fraud, whether or not
material, of which that, to the Knowledge of Parent, involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in the Parent's internal control
over financial reporting.

Schedule, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective Subsidiaries,

incurred any liability for any broker's fees, commissions or finder's fees in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

party to any, and there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,

Parent's stockholders and (ii) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
special meeting of its stockholders (the "Parent Shareholder Meeting") for the
purpose of voting upon the approval the issuance of shares of Parent Stock

the Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby

injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially
delaying the consummation of the Merger.

  

  

(c) Nothing in this Section 7.4 shall be deemed to prevent the Company or the
Company Board from taking any action they are permitted or required to take
under, and in compliance with, Section 7.7 or are required to take under
applicable law.

  

  

7.5 Employees; Employee Benefit Plans.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-40-  

  

 

 

 

  

(a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries
to, (i) give those employees who are, as of the Effective Time, employed by
the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Continuing Employees") full credit
under any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Parent, the
Surviving Company or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Company
covering such Continuing Employees (other than any defined benefit, cash
balance or equity-based plans), including, but not limited to, vacation and
paid time off accruals, (collectively, the "Parent Plans") for such Continuing
Employees' service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any
predecessor entity) to the same extent recognized by the Company and its
Subsidiaries; (ii) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees under any Parent Plan that
is a welfare benefit plan that such employees may be eligible to participate
in after the Effective Time to the same extent waived by the Company and its
Subsidiaries or otherwise not subject to a limitation by the Company and its
Subsidiaries; (iii) provide credit under any such welfare plan for any co-
payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenditures for the remainder of the
coverage period during which any transfer of coverage occurs; and (iv) honor
in accordance with their terms all employee benefit plans or arrangements
maintained by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) From a period of one (1) year from and after the Effective Time, and
subject to the immediately following sentence, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to the Continuing
Employees compensation and benefit arrangements that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than the compensation and benefit arrangements that are provided
to similarly situated employees of Parent; provided, however, that in no event
shall such Continuing Employees compensation and benefit arrangements be less
favorable in the aggregate than such Continuing Employees' current
compensation and benefit arrangements. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to, cause the Continuing Employees to commence participation in
such Parent Plans as are provided to similarly situated employees of Parent.
From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall keep
in full force and effect, and comply with the terms and conditions of, any
agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement between or among the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its or their employees.

  

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 7.5 are for the sole benefit of the parties
to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or
shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including for the
avoidance of doubt any Continuing Employees, present or former employees or
directors, consultants or independent contractors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the
parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters
provided for in this Section 7.5) under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section 7.5 or elsewhere in the Agreement
shall be construed to prevent, from and after the Effective Time, the
termination of employment of any individual Continuing Employee or, subject to
the provisions of Sections 7.5(a) and 7.5(b), any change in the employee
benefits available to any Continuing Employee or the amendment or termination
of any particular Plan in accordance with its terms.

7.6 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Company shall jointly and severally: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
individual who served as a director or officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Indemnified
Parties") (in such Person's capacity as such and not as shareholders of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to the fullest extent required, authorized
or permitted by Minnesota law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection
with any Claim (as defined below) and any judgments, fines (including excise
taxes), penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest,
assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect
of such judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) resulting
therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within thirty (30) days
after any request for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties,
to the fullest extent required, authorized or permitted by Minnesota law, as
now or hereafter in effect, any Expenses (as defined below) incurred in
defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating in
any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including payment
on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Expenses incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect
to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the
requirement of any bond or other security, but in the case of advancement of
Expenses upon receipt of an undertaking, to the extent required by applicable
law, from such Indemnified Party to repay such advanced Expenses if it is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final order that such
Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect
to such Expenses. In the event any Claim is brought against any Indemnified
Party, Parent and the Surviving Company shall each use all commercially
reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of such matter, provided
that neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim (and in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder) without
the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party if and to the extent the
claimant seeks any non-monetary relief (including any admission of liability
or guilt) from such Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to control the defense of any action,
suit, investigation or proceeding with counsel of its own choosing reasonably
acceptable to Parent and Parent and the Surviving Company shall cooperate in
the defense thereof; provided, that Parent shall not be liable for the fees of
more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties, other than local counsel,
unless a conflict of interest shall be caused thereby. The indemnification and
advancement obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company pursuant to this
Section 7.6(a) shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the
Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including with respect to any
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
by the Company Board and the Company's shareholders and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and any Claim relating thereto) and all
rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue
as to an individual who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company
or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time and shall inure to the
benefit of such individual's heirs, executors and personal and legal
representatives. In connection with any determination as to whether the
Indemnified Parties are entitled to the benefits of this Section 7.6, the
burden of proof shall be on Parent and the Surviving Company to establish that
an Indemnified Party is not so entitled. As used in this Section 7.6(a), (A)
the term "Claim" means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, or any inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by the
Company, any Governmental Entity or any other party, or any other matter for
which indemnification is required pursuant to Section 302A.521 of the MBCA,
that any Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to the
institution of any such action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or other
alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to
matters that relate to such Indemnified Party's duties or service as a
director or officer of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any employee
benefit plan maintained by any of the foregoing at or prior to the Effective
Time and any other Person at the request the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; and (B) the term "Expenses" means reasonable attorneys' fees and
all other costs, expenses and obligations (including experts' fees, travel
expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and
binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges)
paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness
in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate,
defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification
is authorized pursuant to this Section 7.6(a), including any action relating
to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-42-  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) From the Effective Time and for a period of six (6) years thereafter,
Parent and the Surviving Company shall keep in full force and effect, and
comply with the terms and conditions of, any agreement in effect as of the
date of this Agreement between or among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any Indemnified Party providing for the indemnification of and advancement
of expenses to such Indemnified Party.

  

  

(c) Without limiting any of the obligations under paragraph (a) of this
Section 7.6, Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and advancement
of expenses and all limitations of liability existing in favor of the
Indemnified Parties as provided in the Company's Articles of Incorporation or
Bylaws or in the corresponding constituent documents of any of the Company's
Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date of this Agreement with respect to
matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect thereafter, without any amendment
thereto.

  

  

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Company, as the case may be
(including Parent's ultimate parent entity, if applicable), assume all of the
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company set forth in this Section 7.6.

  

  

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company as of the Effective Time
to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the
directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing
directors' and officers' insurance policies and the Company's existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in
each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any
period or time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance
carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided
under the Company's existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged
error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of
duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that
existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby),
provided that the annual premium therefor shall not exceed $420,000. If the
Company or the Surviving Company for any reason fail to obtain such "tail"
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall
continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and
after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof
with the Company's current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier
with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Company's existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Company
shall purchase from the Company's current insurance carrier or from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance comparable DandO
Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided in the
Company's existing policies as of the date hereof; provided, however, that
Parent or the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
shall not be required to spend as an annual premium therefor an amount in
excess of $420,000 and (iii) if, during such six (6)-year period, such
insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all or can be obtained only for an
amount in excess of $420,000, Parent or the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause to be obtained as much directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage as can be obtained for $420,000, on terms and conditions
substantially similar to the Company's and the Company's Subsidiaries'
existing directors' and officers' liability insurance.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-43-  

  

 

 

 

  

(f) The provisions of this Section 7.6 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives and (ii)
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise. The obligations of Parent or the Surviving Company under this
Section 7.6 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party under this Section 7.6
without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Company
under this Section 7.6. Parent and the Surviving Company, jointly and
severally, shall pay all expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel, that an Indemnified Party may incur in enforcing the indemnity and
other obligations provided for in this Section 7.6.

  

  

7.7 No Solicitation.

  

  

(a) During the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Section 9.1, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective officers and directors shall, and the Company shall instruct and
cause its and its Subsidiaries' other Representatives to, cease and cause to
be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person that would
otherwise be prohibited by this Section 7.7(a). Promptly following the
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver a written notice to
each such Person to the effect that, subject to the provisions of this Section
7.7, the Company is ending all discussions and negotiations with such Person
with respect to any Alternative Proposal, effective on and from date of this
Agreement, and the notice shall also request such Person to promptly return or
destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries. Subject to the provisions of this Section 7.7, during the period
commencing on the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to
occur of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not, and shall cause its and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit (including by way
of furnishing non-public information), initiate or knowingly encourage or
facilitate any inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or
announcement of, any proposal or offer that constitutes, or is reasonably
expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal, (ii) furnish to any Person
(other than Parent or Merger Sub or their respective designees) any non-public
information relating to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, or afford to any
Person access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other
non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries (other than Parent or Merger Sub or their respective designees),
in any such case relating to an Alternative Proposal or any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that could lead to an Alternative Proposal, (iii)
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Alternative Proposal with any Person, except to
notify such Person as to the existence and content of the provisions of this
Section 7.7, or (iv) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any
standstill or confidentiality agreement (except for any portion of any such
standstill or confidentiality agreement that restricts the ability of a Person
to communicate an Alternative Proposal to Company Board), or anti-takeover
laws.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-44-  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 7.7 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, until this Agreement shall have been approved by
the Company Required Vote, the Company may, directly or indirectly through one
or more Affiliates or Representatives, participate or engage in discussions or
negotiations with, furnish any non-public information relating to the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries to, and/or afford access to the business, properties,
assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to the personnel,
of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries to, a Person or group of Persons that
makes a bona fide Alternative Proposal (under circumstances in which the
Company has complied with its non-solicitation obligations under Section
7.7(a)); provided, however, that the Company shall promptly make available to
Parent and Merger Sub any material non-public information concerning the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such
access which was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub or
their respective Representatives (which requirement may be satisfied by
posting such information in the online data room established by the Company
prior to the date hereof); and provided further that, prior to initiating any
such action, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such
Alternative Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; and provided further
that prior to furnishing such information or access to, or entering into
substantive discussions (except as to the existence of this Section 7.7) or
negotiations with, such Person(s), (A) the Company receives from such
Person(s) an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (B) the Company
notifies Parent to the effect that it intends to furnish information or access
to, or intends to enter into substantive discussions or negotiations with,
such Person(s). In addition to the obligations of the Company and the
Subsidiaries of the Company set forth in clause (b) of this Section 7.7, the
Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any Alternative Proposal
made after the date of this Agreement, which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of any such Alternative Proposal and the identity of the
Person(s) making such Alternative Proposal. The Company agrees that neither
the Company nor any of the Company's Subsidiaries will enter into any
confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof that
prohibits the Company from providing such information to Parent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-45-  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Except as provided by Section 7.7(d), at any time after the execution of
this Agreement, the Company Board shall not:

  

  

(i) resolve to withdraw, modify or qualify and/or withdraw, modify or qualify
the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub (a
"Company Recommendation Change");

  

  

(ii) approve or recommend any Alternative Proposal; or

  

  

(iii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement (an "Alternative
Acquisition Agreement") relating to an Alternative Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in compliance with the terms of Section
7.7(b)) or authorize, approve or publicly recommend an Alternative Proposal or
any agreement, understanding or arrangement relating to an Alternative
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in compliance
with the terms of Section 7.7(b)).

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if
at any time prior to the time that the this Agreement shall have been approved
by the Company Required Vote the Company is then in receipt of a bona fide
written Alternative Proposal from any Person that is not withdrawn and that
the Company Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal
or in connection with a Fiduciary Change, the Company Board may (1) effect a
Company Recommendation Change, and/or (2) adopt, approve, endorse or
recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve, endorse or recommend to the
shareholders of the Company, any Superior Proposal and/or authorize the
Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(c)(ii) to
enter into or consummate an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal (provided, however, that in such event under this
clause (2), the Company concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(c)(ii) and enters into a definitive Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal), then the Company Board may
effect a Company Recommendation Change, if and only if:

  

  

(i) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the Alternative
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, or in the case of a Fiduciary Change
that failure to effect a Company Recommendation Change would reasonably be
expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of
the Company ; and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-46-  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) if the Company Board makes a Company Recommendation Change in connection
with a Superior Proposal, the Company shall have validly terminated this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(c)(ii), including the payment of the
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 9.2(a); provided, however, that (A)
prior to terminating this Agreement, the Company shall give Parent at least
three (3) days' notice thereof, attaching the Alternative Proposal Agreement
(or, if applicable, the most current draft thereof), which notice need only be
given once with respect to any Superior Proposal, unless such Superior
Proposal is modified in any material respect in which case the three day
period referred to herein shall be 48 hours, and (B) if, within such three (3)
day period (or where applicable, 48 hour period), Parent makes an offer that
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith is more
favorable to the shareholders of the Company (other than Parent, Merger Sub
and their respective Affiliates), from a financial point of view, than such
Superior Proposal (taking into account, among other things, (I) the terms of
such offer and (II) such legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other
aspects of such offer which the Company's Board of Directors deems relevant),
and agrees in writing to all adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as are necessary to reflect such offer, the Company's notice of
termination with respect to such Superior Proposal shall be deemed to be
rescinded and of no further force and effect and, if the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company has entered into a Superior Proposal Agreement, it
shall promptly terminate such agreement (it being agreed that the Company will
cause any Alternative Acquisition Agreement entered into prior to the
expiration of such three (3) day period (or where applicable 48 hour period)
to include a provision permitting such termination).

  

  

(e) The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding the matters
contemplated by this Section 7.7 (including any Alternative Proposals).
Without limiting the generality of foregoing, (i) the Company shall promptly
notify Parent if any proposals or offers with respect to an Alternative
Proposal are received by the Company or any of its Representatives indicating,
in connection with such notice, the material terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests,
proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep
Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and material
terms of any such proposals or offers (including any material amendments
thereto), including any change in the Company's intentions as previously
notified, and (ii) the Company agrees that it will promptly notify Parent if
any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any
of its Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the status
of any such discussions or negotiations, including any change in the Company's
intentions as previously notified. The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing such
information to Parent.

  

  

(f) The Company Board may not make a Company Recommendation Change in
connection with a Fiduciary Change unless: (i) the Company provides Parent
with written information describing such Fiduciary Change in reasonable detail
as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware of it; (ii) the Company
keeps Parent reasonably informed (orally and in writing) of developments with
respect to such Fiduciary Change; (iii) the Company notifies Parent in writing
at least four (4) Business Days before making a Company Recommendation Change
with respect to such Fiduciary Change of its intention to do so and specifies
the reasons therefor; (iv) if Parent makes a written proposal during such four
Business Day period to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement (such
written proposal which shall be in a form that would create a binding contract
if accepted by the Company), the Company Board, after taking into
consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as proposed
by Parent, continues to determine in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel) that the failure to make such Company Recommendation Change
would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to
the shareholders of the Company under applicable law; and (v) the Company
shall have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section
9.1(c)(ii), including the payment of the Termination Fee in accordance with
Section 9.2(a).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-47-  

  

 

 

 

  

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i)
taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rules
14d-9 or 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending
disclosure of its position thereunder, or (ii) making any disclosure to its
shareholders if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would
be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary obligations to
the Company's shareholders under applicable law or would constitute a
violation of applicable law. It is understood and agreed that, for purposes of
this Agreement (including Section 9), a factually accurate public statement by
the Company that describes the Company's receipt of an Alternative Proposal
and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto, or any "stop, look
and listen" communication by the Company Board, shall not constitute a Company
Recommendation Change or an approval or recommendation with respect to any
Alternative Proposal.

  

  

(h) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor any of their respective Affiliates,
shall make or enter into any formal or informal arrangements or understandings
(whether or not binding) with any Person, or have any discussions or other

Alternative Proposal involving the Company.

  

  

(i) As used in this Agreement:

  

  

(i) "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" shall mean a customary
confidentiality and standstill agreement that contains confidentiality and
standstill provisions that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate
to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement

Board) or, to the extent applicable, a confidentiality agreement entered into
prior to the execution of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-48-  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) "Alternative Proposal" shall mean any proposal, indication or offer,
including any proposal, indication or offer from or to the Company's
shareholders, made by any Person or group (as defined under Rule 13(d) of the
Exchange Act) other than Parent or its Subsidiaries and/or Affiliates relating
to, whether in a single transaction or series of related transactions, and
whether directly or indirectly, any (i) transaction or series of transactions
(including any merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination, joint venture, partnership, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation or similar direct or indirect transaction involving the Company
and/or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company or the issuance or
acquisition of shares of Company Common Stock or other equity securities of
the Company whose business or businesses constitute twenty percent (20%) (in
number or voting power) or more of the assets, revenues or earnings of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) acquisition, license or
purchase of assets of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries equal to twenty
percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or to which twenty percent (20%) or more of the Company's

acquisition of beneficial ownership (as defined under Rule 13(d) of the
Exchange Act) of equity interests representing a twenty percent (20%) or
greater economic or voting interest in the Company or tender offer (including
a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in
any Person or group (as defined under Rule 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
beneficially owning equity interests representing a twenty percent (20%) (in
number or voting power) or greater economic or voting interest in the Company.

  

  

(iii) "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide Alternative Proposal
(except that references to "twenty percent (20%) or more" in the definition
thereof will be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%) or more") made
by any Person that is on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and
after taking into account all legal, financial (including the financing terms
thereof), regulatory, timing and other aspects of the proposal, as well as any
modification to this Agreement that Parent and Merger Sub propose to make in

shareholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

  

(iv) "Fiduciary Change" means the Company Board, prior to the Company Required
Vote, determines it is obligated to make a Company Recommendation Change
because such a change is advisable to comply with its fiduciary duties to

reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent Board shall take all such steps as may
be required and permitted to cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any acquisition of shares of Parent Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to such Parent Stock) by each individual
who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of

7.10 Tax Treatment. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement
as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.368-2(g). Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take such action so as to cause the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Neither
Parent nor the Company shall take any action prior to the Closing, and Parent
shall not take any action or fail to take any action (and shall prevent the
Company from taking any action or failing to take any action) following the
Closing, that would cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent and the Company shall
report the Merger for income tax purposes as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

  

7.11 Board of Directors of Parent After the Effective Time. Prior to the
Closing, Parent shall take all such action as may be reasonably necessary to
cause one individual selected by the Company and approved by the Parent (such
approval not to be unreasonably conditioned, whithheld or delayed) prior to
the Closing Date from among the Board of Directors of the Company (the
"Company Designee") to be elected to Parent's Board of Directors effective as
of the Effective Time. If at any time prior to or after the Effective Time,
the initial Company Designee is unwilling or unable to serve as a member of
Parent's Board of Directors, then Company Board (including, after the
Effective Time, those individuals who served as members of the Company Board
immediately prior to the Effective Time) shall, by written notice to Parent,
name a new designee who shall be approved by the Parent and who, subject to
such Parent approval, shall thereupon be the Company Designee for all purposes
of this Agreement.

  

  

7.12 Dividends. Parent and the Company shall coordinate with each other
regarding the declaration, setting of record dates, and payment dates of
dividends with respect to shares of Parent Stock and Company Common Stock for
the purpose of minimizing the risk that holders of shares of Company Common
Stock (a) in respect of any calendar quarter, receive dividends on both shares
of Company Common Stock and shares of Parent Stock received as Merger
Consideration or (b) in respect of any calendar quarter, fail to receive a
dividend on shares of Company Common Stock or shares of Parent Stock received
as Merger Consideration.

(i) (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(ii),
Section 9.1(b)(iii) or Section 9.1(d)(i) (due in any such case to a breach of
Section 7.7), (B) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(ii) or Section

pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii), prior to the Company Meeting, any bona fide
Alternative Proposal (substituting fifty percent (50%) for the twenty percent

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section

then in any such event the Company shall pay to Parent (or a Person designated

Such payment shall be made, in the case of a termination referenced in clause

circumstances in which the Termination Fee is or becomes payable pursuant
Section 9.2(a), Parent's and Merger Sub's sole and exclusive remedy (whether
at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Company or
any of its Affiliates with respect to the facts and circumstances giving rise

Section 9.2(a), and upon payment in full of such amount, none of Parent nor
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates nor any other Person shall
have any rights or claims against the Company or any of its Affiliates
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) under or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company
fails promptly to pay Parent any amounts due under this Section 9.2, the
Company shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit
or other legal action, taken to collect payment, together with interest on the
amount of any unpaid fee or obligation at the publicly announced prime rate of
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. in effect from time to time from the date such fee or
obligation was required to be paid.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-54-  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement.

9.2 such amounts as may be required to be withheld therefrom under the Code or
under any provision of U.S. state or local tax law.

(other than Section 9.1(a)) shall give written notice of such termination,
including a description in reasonable detail of the reasons for such
termination, to the other party in accordance with Section 10.5, specifying
the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is
effected. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9, any valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 (other than Section
9.1(a)) shall be effective immediately upon the delivery of notice of the
terminating party to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable. In the
event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company as
provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have
no effect, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that (i)
Sections 7.2(b), 9.2, 10.4 and 10.8 shall survive any termination of this
Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful and
material breach of this Agreement.

  

  

10. GENERAL PROVISIONS

  

  

10.1 Amendment. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective boards of directors, at any time before the Effective Time;
provided, however, that after receipt of the Company Required Vote, there may
not be any amendment of this Agreement which, by applicable law or in
accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further
approval of the Company's shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive

Consideration or which adversely affects the rights of the Company's
shareholders hereunder without the approval of such shareholders. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance
with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

10.6 Interpretation; Construction. The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and the schedules hereto and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement, and Section references are to this
Agreement unless otherwise specified. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." Unless the context otherwise requires, "or"
is not exclusive. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable
to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine
as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require the
Company, Merger Sub, Parent or any of their respective officers, directors,
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to take any action which would violate or conflict
with any applicable law (whether statutory or common), rule or regulation.
This Agreement shall be construed without regard to any presumption or
interpretation against the party drafting or causing any instrument to be
drafted. All schedules accompanying this Agreement and all information
specifically referenced in any such schedule form an integral part of this
Agreement, and references to this Agreement include reference to them.

  

  

10.7 Counterparts; Delivery. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
original, PDF or facsimile counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, and all of which taken together shall be considered one and the same
agreement. Each executed signature page to this Agreement and to each
agreement and certificate delivered by a Party pursuant to this Agreement may
be delivered by any of the methods described in Section 10.5 hereof, provided
that such delivery is effected in accordance with the notice information
provided for in Section 10.5 hereof. In the event that any signature to this
Agreement or any agreement or certificate delivered pursuant hereto, or any
amendment thereof, is delivered by facsimile transmission or by e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, such signature shall create a valid and
binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature
is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or ".pdf"
signature page were an original thereof. No Party shall raise the use of a
facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to deliver
any such signature page or the fact that such signature was transmitted or
communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a
".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation or enforceability of a
contract and each Party forever waives any such defense.

  

  

10.8 Entire Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by all of the
parties to this Agreement, this Agreement (together with the agreements,
documents, schedules and the instruments referred to herein or delivered
herewith) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and any termination
of this Agreement.

10.9 Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions and that, accordingly, the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees
