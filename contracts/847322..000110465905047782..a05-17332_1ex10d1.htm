shall, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the Company, Parent, Sub or the holder thereof, be cancelled
and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive $20.00
in cash (the " _Cash Amount_ "), payable to the holder of the certificate
formerly representing such Share, without interest thereon, upon the
surrender thereof in accordance herewith and with the Articles of Merger at

virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Parent, Sub or the holder thereof, be cancelled and extinguished and cease to
exist and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  

### 

  

### (c) No share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be converted into cash,
securities or other property as a result of the Merger; all shares of Series

shares or the holders thereof.

  

### 

  

## **Section 1.8** ** _Conversion of Sub s Capital Stock_.** Each share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Sub issued and

stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

## 

  

## **Section 1.9** ** _Stock Options and Restricted Stock_.**

  

## 

  

### (a) At the Effective Time, the Company shall use all reasonable efforts
to take all necessary action, including all reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of the individual option holders, if necessary, to (i) terminate the

### _Stock Option Plans_ ") and (ii) to cancel, at the Effective Time, each
option to acquire the Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stock Options_ ")

whether or not vested, under the Companys Stock Option Plans.  Each holder
of a Company Stock Option outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether or not exercisable and whether or not vested,
shall be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time, in exchange for the cancellation of Company Stock Option,
a lump sum cash payment, less applicable withholding taxes, equal to the
excess, if any, of (x) the product of the Cash Amount multiplied by the
number of shares of the Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock
Option over (y) the aggregate exercise price for such Company Stock Option.
The Company shall take all action necessary (i) to approve the disposition of
the Company Stock Options in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to the extent necessary to exempt such dispositions and
acquisitions under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act (as defined in Section 2.3)

payment, less applicable withholding taxes, equal to the amount of such
participants account balance under the Deferred Compensation Plan or, if
later, as soon as such cash payment can be made under the terms of the
Deferred Compensation Plan without triggering the additional tax and interest
under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code (as defined in Section 4.14(a)).

  

### 

  

### (c) At the Effective Time, each restricted or otherwise unvested Share or
Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, as provided in the Company Employee Benefit Plans (as defined in

as set forth in Section 1.10 to the extent not otherwise cancelled and paid

## 

  

### (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall designate Registrar
and Transfer Company or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to Sub to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") in connection with the
Merger (which bank or trust company shall agree in writing to comply with the
provisions of this Section 1.10 applicable to it).  At the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation (with funds obtained from Parent) or Parent shall
deposit in trust (which trust shall be for the benefit of the stockholders of
the Company) with the Paying Agent an amount (the " _Payment Fund_ ") in
immediately available funds equal to the sum of (x) the product of (i) the
sum of (A) the aggregate number of Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Shares held by any Subsidiary of the Company)
plus (B) the aggregate number of the Companys restricted stock units
outstanding and (ii) the Cash Amount and (y) the excess, if any, of (i) the
product of the Cash Amount multiplied by the aggregate number of Shares
underlying Company Stock Options that entitle the holders thereof to purchase
such Shares at a price per share less than the Cash Amount (to the extent
that such Company Stock Options have not been cancelled and paid for pursuant
to Section 1.9(a)) over (ii) the

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

### aggregate exercise price for such Company Stock Options.  The Payment
Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving
Corporation (so long as such directions do not impair the rights of the
holders of Shares or the ability of the Paying Agent to make timely payments
as required hereby), in direct obligations of the United States of America or
any state thereof, obligations for which the full faith and credit of the
United States of America or any such state is pledged to provide for
the payment of principal and interest, commercial paper either rated of the
highest quality by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation or certificates of deposit issued by, or other deposit
accounts of, a commercial bank having at least $1,000,000,000 in capital and
surplus, in each case with a maturity of three months or less. Any earnings
with respect thereto shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation as and when
requested by the Surviving Corporation. If at any time the amount of the
Payment Fund shall be less than the amount required to make the
payments contemplated by Section 1.7, the Surviving Corporation shall
promptly deposit in trust with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to make
such payments. The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions,
make the cash payments referred to in Section 1.7 out of the Payment Fund.

  

### 

  

### (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to
each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate
or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced
ownership of a Share or Shares and the associated Right or Rights (the "
_Certificates_ ") a form letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates for payment therefor. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of
a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, and
any other required documents, the holder of such Certificate shall receive
as promptly as practicable in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to
the product of the number of Shares represented by such Certificate and the
Cash Amount, and such Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the
Certificates. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered and
exchanged in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.10, each
Certificate (other than any Certificates representing Shares and the
associated Rights held by any Subsidiary of the Company) shall represent for
all purposes only the right to receive the consideration set forth in Section
1.7 without any interest thereon, and until such surrender and exchange no
cash shall be delivered to the holder of such outstanding Certificate in
respect thereof.

  

### 

  

### (c) At any time following the date that is six months after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any funds (including the remaining portion of the Payment
Fund and any interest received with respect thereto) that are held by the
Paying Agent that have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws)
for distribution of the consideration provided in Section 1.7, upon due
surrender of their Certificates.

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

### Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to a holder of a Certificate for the
consideration provided in Section 1.7 properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  

### 

  

### (d) From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
evidencing ownership of Shares and associated Rights outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such Shares and associated Rights, except as otherwise provided for herein or
by applicable law.

  

### 

  

### (e) After the Effective Time there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
for the consideration provided in Section 1.7 in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 1.10.

  

### 

  

### (f) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and subject to such
other conditions as the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation may
impose, the Surviving Corporation shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Cash Amount deliverable in respect thereof as
determined in accordance herewith. When authorizing such payment of the Cash
Amount in exchange therefor, the Board of Directors of the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate to give the Surviving Corporation a bond in such sum as
it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

### 

  

### (g) No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of the Cash Amount
at any time.

  

### 

  

### (h) Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the merger consideration payable under this Agreement such amounts as
may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under (i) the Code or
(ii) any applicable, state, local or foreign Tax (as defined in Section
4.14(a)) laws. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such
amounts shall be timely paid to the appropriate taxing authority and shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

### 

  

## **Section 1.11** ** _Further Assurances_.** If at any time after the
Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised
that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or
things are necessary, desirable or proper (i) to vest, perfect or confirm,
of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises,
properties or assets of either Constituent Corporation, or (ii) otherwise to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its
proper officers and directors or their designees shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either of the Constituent
Corporations, all such deeds,

## bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the name and on
behalf of either Constituent Corporation, all such other acts and things as
may be necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm the
Surviving Corporations right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of such
Constituent Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.

renewals thereof applicable to it, other than where the failure to so comply
would not individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or materially impair the ability of the Company or
its Subsidiaries to own and operate their respective properties, assets and
businesses. No event has occurred with respect to any of the Company
Authorizations which permits, or after notice or lapse of time or both would
permit, revocation or termination thereof or would result in any other
material impairment of the rights of the holder of any such
Company Authorizations. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is not
pending any application, petition, objection or other pleading with any
Governmental Entity having jurisdiction or authority over the operations of
the Company or its Subsidiaries which questions the validity of or contests
any Company Authorization or which could reasonably be expected, if accepted

## 

  

### (a) It is understood and agreed that the Company, together with

its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any officer, director
or employee of or any investment banker, attorney, accountant, agent or other

(including any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of
understanding or confidentiality agreement) with respect to any Takeover

Proposal or (iv) grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to a class of the equity securities of the Company;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, in

Takeover Proposal received pursuant to the Asset Auction) received after the
date hereof that the Board of Directors of the Company believes in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and with the Company Financial
Advisor or another financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal
(as defined in Section 4.10(b)), and which Takeover Proposal was not,
directly or indirectly, the result of a breach of this Section 4.10, and to
the extent required by the fiduciary obligations of the Board of Directors of
the Company, as determined in good faith by a majority of the disinterested
members thereof after receiving the advice of outside counsel, the Company
and any of its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, agents or other advisors or representatives may, (A) participate
in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Takeover Proposal
regarding such Takeover Proposal, or (B) furnish information pursuant to an
appropriate confidentiality agreement (no less restrictive to the Person
making such Takeover Proposal than the confidentiality agreement dated
January 31, 2005, between CW Capital Investments LLC and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ")). Without limiting the

### foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in the preceding sentence by any officer, director or employee of or
any investment banker, attorney, accountant, agent or other advisor or
representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such
Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this paragraph by the Company. For all purposes of this Agreement,
" _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer, other than a
proposal by Parent or Sub, for a merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination or other similar transaction involving the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any inquiry, proposal or offer (including, without
limitation, any proposal or offer to stockholders of the Company), other than
a proposal or offer by Parent or Sub, to acquire in any manner, directly or
indirectly, a significant equity interest in, a significant amount of any
voting securities of, or a substantial portion of the assets of, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.  Other than in connection with the Asset Auction,
the Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with
respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover
Proposal.

  

### 

  

### (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the approval, recommendation or declaration
of advisability by the Board of Directors of the Company or any such
committee of this Agreement or the Merger or (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company may (A) approve or recommend
a Superior Proposal and/or (B) withdraw or modify its approval or
recommendation or declaration of advisability of this Agreement or the Merger
(the " _Company Recommendation_ "), in each case as provided in Section
4.10(f). For all purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a
bona fide written Takeover Proposal that is not solicited by, or the result
of any solicitation by, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or by any of
their respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants, agents or other advisors or representatives after the
date hereof (other than as permitted by Section 4.10(a)), made by a third
party to acquire the Company pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a
merger, consolidation or business combination, a share exchange, a sale
of all or substantially all its assets or otherwise (x) on terms which
a majority of the disinterested **** members of the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in their good faith judgment (based on the opinion of
independent financial advisors that the value of the consideration provided
for in such Takeover Proposal (after giving effect to the payment of the
Expenses (as defined in Section 4.11(c)), exceeds the value of the
consideration provided for in the Merger) to be more favorable to the Company
and its stockholders than the Merger, (y) which is reasonably likely to be
consummated (taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, including any conditions, and
the identity of the offeror) and (z) for which financing, to the extent
required, is then fully committed or which, in the good faith judgment of a
majority of such disinterested members (based on the advice of independent
financial advisors), is reasonably capable of being financed by such third
party. If, to the extent permitted by this Section 4.10(b), the Board of
Directors of the Company (including a majority of the disinterested
directors) approves or recommends a Superior Proposal, the Company may take
appropriate action to render the Rights inapplicable to such Superior
Proposal.

  



  

35   

     
   

  



  

### (c) The Company, promptly (and in any event within 48 hours of the date
of receipt thereof), shall advise Parent orally and in writing of any
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or which could reasonably be
expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions
of such Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the identity of the Person making
any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the Company shall promptly provide
to Parent copies of any written materials received by the Company in
connection with any of the foregoing. The Company will keep
Parent reasonably informed of the status and the material terms and
conditions (including amendments and proposed amendments) of any such
Takeover Proposal or inquiry. Parent and Sub shall waive any applicable
confidentiality provisions to the extent necessary to allow the Company to
explain the terms of this transaction to each Person, if any, making a
Takeover Proposal.

  

### 

  

### (d) If, prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company receives
a Takeover Proposal which (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) which
a majority of the disinterested members of the Companys Board of Directors
in good faith concludes proposes consideration that is more favorable to
the Companys stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and which could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior

## **Section 6.6** ** _No Assignment_.** Neither this Agreement nor any
rights or obligations under it are assignable by any party without the
written consent of the other parties.

  

## 

  

## **Section 6.7** ** _Headings_.** The descriptive headings of the
articles, sections and subsections of this Agreement are for convenience only
and do not constitute a part of this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## **Section 6.8** ** _Counterparts_.** This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts and by different parties in separate counterparts.
All such counterparts shall

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

## constitute one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one
or more counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the
other party.

  

## 

  

## **Section 6.9** ** _Interpretation_.** The word " _including_ ", when
used herein, shall be deemed to mean " _including, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing_ ". When a reference is made in this Agreement
to an Article, a Section or an Exhibit, such reference shall be to an article
of this Agreement, a section of this Agreement or an Exhibit attached to this
Agreement, respectively, unless otherwise indicated.

  

## 

  

## **Section 6.10** ** _Remedies; Waiver_.** All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive
of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.  No failure on the part of
any party to exercise or delay in exercising any right hereunder shall be
deemed a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise preclude
any further or other exercise of such or any other right. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, it is understood and agreed that remedies
at law would be inadequate in the case of any breach of the covenants
contained in this Agreement. The Company, Parent and Sub shall be entitled
to equitable relief, including the remedy of specific performance, with
respect to any breach or attempted breach of such covenants by any other
party.

  

## 

  

## **Section 6.11** ** _Confidentiality_. **The parties agree that any
information heretofore or hereafter provided by the Company to Parent or Sub
shall, until the Effective Date, be subject to the confidentiality provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement, and until the Effective Date Parent and Sub
agree to keep such information confidential to the extent required by
such confidentiality provisions, without giving effect to the termination
provisions of such agreement.

  

## 

  

## **Section 6.12** ** _Severability_.** Any invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement in any jurisdiction
shall not invalidate or render illegal or unenforceable the remaining
provisions hereof in such jurisdiction and shall not invalidate or render
illegal or unenforceable such provisions in any other jurisdiction. The
Company and the Parent and Sub shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to
replace any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision with a valid, legal
and enforceable provision, the economic effect of which comes as close as
possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.

  

## 

  

## **Section 6.13** ** _Amendment; Waiver_.** This Agreement may
be amended only by agreement in writing of all parties. No waiver of any
provision nor consent to any exception to the terms of this Agreement shall
be effective unless in writing and signed by the party to be bound and then
only to the specific purpose, extent and instance so provided.

  



  

45   

     
   

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Sub and the Company have caused this Agreement to
be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized all as of
the date first written above.
