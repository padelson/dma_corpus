complete control and supervision over their respective businesses. 

  

(b) Purchaser shall not knowingly or willfully take, or permit any of its
Affiliates to take, or omit to take, or permit any of its Affiliates to omit
to take, any action (i) that would, or is reasonably likely to, prevent or
materially delay the consummation of, or materially impair Purchasers
ability to consummate, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii)
that is intended or is reasonably likely to result in (x) any of the
conditions set forth in Article VIII not being satisfied or (y) a breach or
violation of any provision of this Agreement by Purchaser. 

  

(c) Without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, except as contemplated
by _Article VI_ , none of the Acquired Companies will, between the date
hereof and the Closing, (1) make any change in employment or compensation
terms for any employee, (2) establish, adopt, enter into, or, except as
required by Law, amend any Plan, (3) make any new 

 

    ##### 

  

 

grants or awards under any Plan, or (4) hire any new employees other than as
may be necessary to replace any employees whose employment terminates after
the date of this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the
Acquired Companies shall hire any new employees to replace any of the
employees listed on _Section 6.02_ of the Disclosure Schedule. 

  

(d) Without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, neither the Parent nor
any of the Acquired Companies shall, between the date hereof and the Closing,
make or change any election, change an annual accounting period, adopt or
change any accounting method, file any amended Tax Return, enter into any
closing agreement, settle any Tax claim or assessment relating to
the Acquired Companies, surrender any right to claim a refund of Taxes,
consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any
Tax claim or assessment relating to the Acquired Companies, or take any other
similar action, or omit to take any action relating to the filing of any Tax
Return or the payment of any Tax, if such election, adoption, change,
amendment, agreement, settlement, surrender, consent or other action or
omission could reasonably be expected to increase the future Tax liability or
decrease any future Tax benefit of the Acquired Companies. 

  

Section 5.02 _Access to Information_. (a) From the date hereof until the
Closing, upon reasonable notice, the Parent shall cause the Acquired
Companies and their officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives,
accountants and counsel to (i) afford the Purchaser and its authorized
representatives reasonable access to the offices, properties and books and
records of the Acquired Companies and (ii) furnish to the officers,
employees, and authorized agents and representatives of the Purchaser such
additional financial and operating data and other information regarding the
Business (or copies thereof) as the Purchaser may from time to time
reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access or
furnishing of information shall be conducted at the Purchasers expense,
during normal business hours, under the supervision of the Parents personnel
and in such a manner as not to interfere with the normal operations of
the Business. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Parent shall not be required to disclose any information to the Purchaser if
such disclosure would, in the Parents sole discretion, (i) cause significant
competitive harm to the Business if the transactions contemplated hereby are
not consummated, (ii) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege
or (iii) contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date hereof. 

  

(b) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by the Parent relating to the Business, for a period of seven years
after the Closing, the Purchaser shall (i) retain the books and records
relating to the Business and the Acquired Companies relating to periods prior
to the Closing and (ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the officers,
employees, agents and representatives of the Parent reasonable access
(including the right to make, at the Parents expense, photocopies), during
normal business hours, to such books and records. 

  

Section 5.03 _Confidentiality_. (a) The terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated as of June 7, 2011 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
between the Parent and the Purchaser are hereby incorporated herein by
reference and shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at
which time such Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of the Purchaser
under this _Section 5.03_ shall terminate. If this Agreement is, for any
reason, 

 

    ##### 

  

 

 terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
nonetheless continue in full force and effect. 

  

(b) Nothing provided to the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 5.02(a)_ shall in
any way amend or diminish the Purchasers obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any
information provided to the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 5.02(a)_ or
otherwise by the Parent, the Seller, any Acquired Company or any officer,
director, employee, agent, representative, accountant or counsel thereof
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement. 

  

Section 5.04 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents_. (a)
Each of the parties shall use its reasonable efforts to promptly obtain all
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of all Governmental
Authorities and officials that may be or become necessary for its execution
and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to,
this Agreement and will cooperate fully with the other party in promptly
seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals.
Each party hereto agrees to make promptly its respective filing, if
necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement within three (3) Business Days of
the date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Neither Parent nor the
Seller shall be required to pay any fees or other payments to any
Governmental Authorities in order to obtain any such authorization, consent,
order or approval. 

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of each partys undertaking pursuant to
_Section 5.04(a)_ , each party agrees to use its reasonable efforts and to
take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may
be asserted by any United States antitrust authority or any other party so as
to enable the parties hereto to expeditiously close the transactions
contemplated hereby no later than December 1, 2011 (the " _Termination Date_
"). In addition, the Purchaser shall use its reasonable efforts to defend
through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in
order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order
or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent
the Closing by the Termination Date unless the parties to this Agreement
agree that litigation is not in their mutual best interests. 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to make
proposals, execute or perform agreements or submit to orders providing for a
Divestiture. 

  

(d) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other party of any
communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed communication by
such party to any Governmental Authority. Neither party to this Agreement
shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry in respect of this
Agreement unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party
the opportunity to attend and participate at such 

 

    ##### 

  

 

meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Law, the
parties to this Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other
in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other
party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking
early termination of any applicable waiting periods including under the HSR
Act. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties to this Agreement
will provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings or
communications between them or any of their representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand,
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 

  

(e) Each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly
obtain the consents of third parties set forth on _Section 3.04_ of the
Disclosure Schedule that are necessary for the performance of its obligations
pursuant to this Agreement and will cooperate fully with the other party in
promptly seeking to obtain such consents. 

  

Section 5.05 _Notifications; Update of Disclosure Schedule_. Prior to the
Closing Date, Parent may supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule
furnished by it under this Agreement to reflect matters arising after the
date of this Agreement. Any such supplement or amendment to the Disclosure
Schedule shall not have the effect of modifying the representations or
warranties of Parent contained in this Agreement for purposes of determining
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.02_ or for purposes
of determining a breach of the representations and warranties of Parent for
purposes of _Section 9.02_. 

  

Section 5.06 _Transition Services_. Following the Closing, the Parent shall
provide, or cause to be provided, to the Business certain services that are
currently provided by the Parent and its Affiliates to the Business, all as
more fully set forth in a transition services agreement substantially in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit 5.06_ (the " _Transition
Services Agreement_ ") to be entered into by the Parent or its Affiliate and
the Purchaser as of the Closing. 

  

Section 5.07 _Further Action_. The parties hereto shall use all reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, to do or cause
to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law,
and to execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be
required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

Section 5.08 _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Parent and the Seller agree
that between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of (a) the Closing or
(b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the
Parent and the Seller shall not (and shall cause their respective Affiliates
not to), directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate or encourage any other
proposals or offers from any Person relating to any acquisition of all or any
portion of the equity interests of any Acquired Company or material Assets or
(ii) participate in any discussions, conversations, negotiations and other
communications regarding, or furnish to any other Person any information with
respect to, any effort or attempt by any other Person to seek to do any of
the foregoing. The Parent and the Seller shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to) immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions, negotiations or other communications with any Persons
heretofore conducted with respect to any of the foregoing. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 5.09 _Termination of Certain Agreements_. Except as set forth on
_Section 5.09_ of the Disclosure Schedule, all agreements between the Parent
or the Seller or any Affiliate of the Parent or the Seller (other than the
Acquired Companies), on the one hand, and any Acquired Company, on the other
hand, shall be terminated as of the Closing, and all obligations
and liabilities thereunder shall be satisfied on the Closing in accordance
with the terms of such agreements, other than any agreements relating to the
indemnification of current directors, managers, members and/or officers of
any Acquired Company. 

  

Section 5.10 _Director/Manager/Member and Officer Liability and
Indemnification_. For the duration of a period of six years commencing on the
Closing, the Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any Acquired Company
to amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in any Acquired Companys
organizational governing documents, including any articles of incorporation,
bylaws, operating agreement or partnership agreement (including the
Subsidiary Governing Documents), relating to the exculpation or
indemnification of any officers, managers, members and/or directors, it being
the intent of the parties hereto that the present (as of the Closing) and
former officers, managers, members and directors of any Acquired Company
shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification to the
full extent of the Law. Parent shall, prior to the Closing, cooperate with
Purchaser to cause Parents existing director and officer liability insurance
policy to be converted, at Purchasers expense, into a runoff policy. 

   

Section 5.11 _Release of Letters of Credit and Guarantees; Deposits_. 

  

(a) Prior to the Closing, and subject to the terms set forth in _Section
5.11(c)_, the Purchaser shall obtain and deliver to each beneficiary of a
Letter of Credit listed on _Section 5.11(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule a
substitute letter of credit or other form of security acceptable to the
beneficiary to replace in all respects such Letter of Credit, with
each substitute letter of credit (or other security) having a face amount of
at least the remaining amount under the Letter of Credit that it is intended
to replace. Prior to Closing and subject to the terms set forth in _Section
5.11(c)_, the Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain from the beneficiary of each Letter of Credit listed on _Section
5.11(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule and deliver to the Parent a full and
unconditional release of all of the obligations of the Parent and its
applicable Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) with respect to
such Letter of Credit (which release shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Parent and provides for the return to the Parent of each such Letter of
Credit marked cancelled). For the purposes of this Agreement, "Letters of
Credit" shall mean, collectively, all letters of credit issued in connection
with the Business for which the Parent or any of its Affiliates (other
than any Acquired Companies) is an applicant. The Letters of Credit, to the
extent existing as of the date hereof, are set forth in _Section 5.11(a)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that,
prior to Closing, Purchaser is not able to provide a substitute letter of
credit or other security for any of the Letters of Credit set forth in
_Section 5.11(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule that are marked with an asterisk
(*), Purchaser shall cause to be delivered to Parent at Closing a guarantee
by Centrica plc (" _Guarantor_ ") in favor of Seller and Parent in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Purchaser s Guarantee_"), pursuant
to which Guarantor will provide a guarantee in the amount of such Letters of
Credit as to which substitute collateral is not provided prior to Closing (the
" _Continuing LCs_ "). Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such Continuing LCs to be released within thirty (30) days
following the Closing Date, 

 

    ##### 

  

 

and in any event shall cause such continuing Letters of Credit to be released
within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date.

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, and subject to the terms set forth in _Section
5.11(c)_, the Purchaser shall obtain and deliver to each beneficiary of a
Guarantee listed on _Section 5.11(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule a substitute
guarantee or other form of security acceptable to the beneficiary to replace
in all respects such Guarantee (provided that the Purchaser shall not be
required to issue (or have issued on its behalf) any performance guarantees).
Prior to the Closing, and subject to the terms set forth in _Section
5.11(c)_, the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
from the beneficiary of each Guarantee listed on  _Section 5.11(b)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule and deliver to the Parent a full and unconditional
release of all of the obligations of the Parent and its Affiliates (other than
any Acquired Companies) with respect to such Guarantee (which release shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Parent). For the purposes of this Agreement,
"Guarantees" shall mean, collectively, those indemnities, performance bonds,
surety bonds, performance guaranties, other guaranty obligations, keepwells,
net worth maintenance agreements, reimbursement obligations, letters of
comfort and other similar arrangements to which the Parent or any of its
Affiliates (other than any Acquired Company) is a party or by which any of
them are bound in favor of, or for the benefit of, any Acquired Company or
the Business (other than the Letters of Credit). All Guarantees, to the
extent existing as of the date hereof, are set forth in _Section 5.11(b)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule. 

  

(c) Parent and Seller shall cooperate fully with the Purchaser to facilitate
the release of the Letters of Credit and Guarantees, including initiating
contact with each of the counterparties and requesting the release thereof,
providing all necessary information to the Purchaser and providing dedicated
legal and financial personnel of Parent or Seller to interact with
the Purchaser and the counterparties. The Parent agrees that, with respect to
_Sections 5.11(a)_ and _5.11(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, the Parent
shall have the continuing obligation until the Closing to supplement or amend
promptly such sections of the Disclosure Schedule with respect to any Letters
of Credit or Guarantees, as the case may be, which, if existing at the
date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth in _Section
5.11(a)_ or  _Section 5.11(b)_, respectively, and to provide such
supplements or amendments to the Purchaser on a regular basis. 

  

Section 5.12 _Financing_. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
conditional upon the receipt by Purchaser of the proceeds of any financing
and that any failure by Purchaser to have available within three (3) Business
Days after the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VIII_ are
satisfied or capable of satisfaction all funds necessary to consummate the
Purchase shall constitute a material breach by Purchaser of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.13 _Competing Transactions_. Purchaser agrees that it shall not,
and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly,
acquire or agree to acquire, or be acquired or agree to be acquired by,
whether by merger, consolidation, or purchasing a substantial portion of the
assets of or equity in, any Person offering competitive energy supply services
to retail customers within ERCOT, if the entering into of a definitive
agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition, merger,
consolidation or purchase could reasonably 

  

    ##### 

  

  

 be expected to (x) impose any material delay in the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period or impose any material delay in
the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any Governmental
Approvals necessary to consummate the Purchase or (y) increase the risk of
any Governmental Authority entering a prohibitive order; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.13_ will apply to any
acquisition of, or agreement to acquire, Centrica plc, whether by merger,
consolidation, or purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity
in such company. 

   

Section 5.14 _Non-Competition/Non-Solicitation_. 

  

(a) The Parent, Seller, and their Affiliates agree that for a period of
thirty-six (36) months beginning at the Closing, neither Parent, Seller, nor
their Affiliates will offer, or participate through ownership in offering,
competitive energy supply services to retail customers within the region of
the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (" _ERCOT_ "); provided the
foregoing will not restrict Parent, Seller or any of their Affiliates (i)
from entering into any merger, consolidation, acquisition, change of control
or other similar transaction in which Parent, Seller or an Affiliate is
acquired by a Person that offers, or whose Affiliate offers, competitive
energy supply services to retail customers in ERCOT, or (ii) from entering
into any merger, consolidation, acquisition, change of control or other
similar transaction in which Parent, Seller or an Affiliate acquires a Person
that (together with its Affiliates) is engaged in offering competitive
energy supply services to retail customers in ERCOT, so long as (A) such
Person (together with any Affiliates that are acquired) does not have more
than 25,000 retail customers in ERCOT and (B) no more than twenty percent
(20%) of the revenues of such Person (together with any Affiliates that are
acquired) are derived from offering competitive energy supply services to
retail customers in ERCOT. 

  

(b) The Parent, Seller, and their Affiliates agree that they shall not, for a
period of twenty-four (24) months beginning at the Closing, in any manner
directly or indirectly or by assisting others, recruit or hire away or
attempt to recruit or hire away, on their behalf or on behalf of any other
Person, any Transferred Employee that is employed at any Acquired Company. 

  

(c) The Parent and Seller, for themselves and on behalf of their Affiliates,
acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.14_
are reasonably designed to protect the Purchasers substantial investment and
are reasonable with respect to duration, geographical area and scope. 

  

ARTICLE VI 
 EMPLOYEE MATTERS 

    

Section 6.01 _Offer of Employment_. 

  

As of the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies to
continue the employment, on terms and conditions ( _e.g_., salary, wages,
bonuses, commissions, etc.) that specifically and collectively are comparable
to such terms and conditions as in effect prior to the Closing, to each of
the then employees of the Acquired Companies listed on _Exhibit
6.01_, including, but not limited to, active employees, those employees on
approved leaves of absence 

 

    ##### 

  

  

 and those employees on disability leaves of absence for a period of less
than 6 months (the " _Transferred Employees_ "). Any expressed intention by
Purchaser to continue the employment of the Transferred Employees as set
forth in this _Section 6.01_ will not constitute a contract on the part of
Purchaser to a post-Closing employment relationship of any fixed term
or duration or upon any terms or conditions other than those that Purchaser
may establish pursuant to individual offers of employment, and employment
offered by Purchaser is "at will" and may be terminated by Purchaser or by an
employee at any time for any reason (subject to any written commitments to
the contrary made by Purchaser or an employee and to any requirements of
applicable Law). Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to prevent or
restrict in any way the right of Purchaser to terminate, reassign, promote or
demote any of the Transferred Employees after the Closing or to change
adversely or favorably the title, powers, duties, responsibilities,
functions, locations, salaries, other compensation or terms or conditions of
employment of such employees. Further, the provisions of this Article VI are
for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein,
expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to constitute an
amendment to any of the compensation and benefit plans maintained for or
provided to Transferred Employees prior to or following the Closing Date, or
confer upon or give to any person (including for the avoidance of doubt any
current or former directors, officers, owners, employees, or independent
contractors of the Acquired Companies) any legal or equitable rights or
remedies with respect to the matters provided for in this Article VI or any
other provision of this Agreement. 

   

Section 6.02 _Employee Benefits_. 

  

Except as set forth on _Section 6.02_ of the Disclosure Schedule, as of the
Closing, each Transferred Employee and each employee of the Acquired
Companies shall cease to be covered under the Plans. As of the Closing, the
Purchaser shall maintain employee benefit and compensation arrangements, for
the benefit of Transferred Employees that provide for compensation and
benefits (both specifically and in the aggregate) equal to the compensation
and benefits provided to such Transferred Employees under the Plans in effect
immediately prior to the Closing, or that provide compensation and benefits
(both specifically and in the aggregate) equivalent to those provided under
corresponding plans of the Purchaser which are applicable to their respective
similarly situated employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that changes may be
made to the extent necessary to comply with applicable Laws. Each Transferred
Employee shall receive credit for service with the Parent, the Seller, the
Acquired Companies and their Affiliates under the Purchasers employee
benefit plans for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not
benefit accrual), including benefits relating to vacation and paid time off;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall such credit result in the
duplication of benefits. The Purchaser shall recognize, or cause to be
recognized, for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under
its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by
Transferred Employees in the calendar year in which the Closing occurs,
provided Seller timely provides to Purchaser the information necessary to
comply with this obligation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the
Acquired Companies shall cause the employment of each of the individuals
identified on _Section 6.02_ of the Disclosure Schedule to be
terminated coincident with the Closing and Parent shall pay all compensation
payable to such individuals, including salary, bonuses and severance and
separation benefits. Seller agrees that such individuals, and their covered
dependents, shall be permitted to elect to maintain continued health plan
coverage under Code Section 4980B under Sellers Plans in order to minimize
disruption to their benefits.

ARTICLE VII 

   

TAX MATTERS 

   

Section 7.01 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. Purchaser, Parent and Seller
agree to make an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

Section 7.02 _Tax Indemnities_. 

  

(a) The Parent shall indemnify and hold the Acquired Companies and the
Purchaser harmless against Excluded Taxes (except to the extent that such
Taxes are reflected on the Closing Statement). 

  

(b) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period,
the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date shall be: in the case of Taxes that are
either (x) based upon or related to income or receipts or (y) imposed in
connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real
or personal, tangible or intangible) (other than conveyances pursuant to this
Agreement, as provided under Section 7.07) or in connection with any payment
of compensation or the purchase of property, deemed equal to the amount which
would be payable (after giving effect to amounts which may be deducted from
or offset against such Taxes) if the taxable period ended on the Closing Date;
and in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the
assets of any Acquired Company, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period (after giving effect to amounts which may be deducted
from or offset against such Taxes), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.
Any credit or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle
Period shall be prorated based upon the method employed in this paragraph (b)
taking into account the type of Tax to which the refund relates. In the case
of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including net worth or long-
term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated under
this Section 7.02(b) shall be computed by reference to the level of such
items on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to effect the
foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practice of the Acquired Companies. 

  

(c) Payment by the indemnifying party of any amount due under this _Section
7.02_ shall be made within ten (10) days following written notice by the
indemnified party that payment of such amounts to the appropriate taxing
authority is due, _provided_ , that the indemnifying party shall not be
required to make any payment earlier than two days before it is due to the
appropriate taxing authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, if the indemnified party receives an assessment or other notice of
Taxes due with respect to any Acquired Company for any taxable period (or
portion of any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date) for
which the indemnified party is not responsible in whole or in part pursuant
to paragraph (a) of this Section 7.02, then the indemnifying party shall pay
such Taxes, or if the indemnified party pays such Taxes, then the
indemnifying party shall pay to the indemnified party the amount of such
Taxes for which the indemnified party is not responsible within five (5) days
following such payment. In the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance
with the 

 

    ##### 

  

  

provisions of _Section 7.04_, payment of the Tax to the appropriate taxing
authority will be considered to be due no earlier than the date a final
determination to such effect is made by the appropriate taxing authority or
court. 

 

Section 7.03 _Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits_. (a) Any Tax refund, credit or
similar benefit (including any interest paid or credited with respect
thereto) relating to taxable periods (or portions of taxable period) ending
on or before the Closing Date shall be the property of the Parent, and if
received by the Purchaser or any Acquired Company, shall be paid over promptly
to the Parent. The Purchaser shall, if the Parent so requests and at the
Parents expense, cause any Acquired Company or other relevant entity to file
for and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and expedite the receipt of
any refund to which the Parent is entitled under this _Section 7.02_. The
Purchaser shall permit the Parent to participate in (at the Parents expense)
the prosecution of any such refund claim. 

  

(b) Any amount otherwise payable by the indemnifying party under _Section
7.02_ shall be reduced by any Tax benefit to the indemnified party arising in
connection with any underlying adjustment resulting in the obligation of the
indemnified party to pay Taxes or other amounts for which the indemnified
party is responsible under _Section 7.02_ or the accrual or payment of such
Taxes. 

   

Section 7.04 _Tax Claims_. 

  

(a) If after the Closing, the Purchaser receives notice of a proposed
assessment or the commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding or of any demand or claim on the Purchaser, its Affiliates or the
Acquired Companies (a "Tax Claim"), which, if determined adversely to the
taxpayer or after the lapse of time, could be grounds for indemnification by
the Parent under Section 7.02, the Purchaser shall give the Parent notice of
such Tax Claim within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice; provided,
however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Parent
from any of its obligations under this Article VII except to the extent that
such failure results in a detriment to the Parent, and shall not relieve the
Parent from any other Liability that it may have to Purchaser, its Affiliates
or the Acquired Companies other than under this Article VII. The Parent shall
be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Tax Claim at its
expense and through counsel of its choice if it gives notice of its intention
to do so to the Purchaser within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of such
notice from the Purchaser. If the Parent elects to undertake any such defense
against a Tax Claim, the Purchaser may participate in such defense at its own
expense. The Purchaser shall cooperate with the Parent in such defense and
make available to the Parent, at the Parents expense, all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Purchaser or its Acquired
Companies possession or under the Purchaser or Acquired Companies control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Parent. If the Parent
elects to direct the defense of any such Tax Claim, the Purchaser shall
not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of such Tax Claim unless the Parent
consents in writing to such payment or unless the Parent withdraws from the
defense of such Tax Claim or unless a final judgment from which no appeal may
be taken by or on behalf of the Parent is entered against the Purchaser or
the Acquired Companies for such Tax Claim. If Parent has elected not to assume
and control the defense of a Tax Claim, and Purchaser assumes the defense of
any such Tax Claim and proposes to settle such Tax Claim prior to a final
judgment thereon or to forgo any appeal with respect thereto, then the
Purchaser

 shall give the Parent prompt written notice thereof and the Parent shall
have the right, at its expense, to participate in the settlement or assume or
reassume the defense of such claims or proceeding. 

  

(b) If after the Closing, the Parent receives notice of a proposed assessment
or the commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding
or of any demand or claim on Parent or its Affiliates relating to inclusion
in a combined, consolidated or group Tax Return of Parent or any of its
Affiliates of items of income, gain, loss deduction or credit relating to
any of the Acquired Companies (a "Combined Tax Claim"), the Parent shall be
entitled to assume and control the defense of such Tax Claim at its expense
and through counsel of its choice and the Purchaser shall cooperate with the
Parent in such defense and make available to the Parent, at the Parents
expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Purchaser or its Acquired Companies possession or under the Purchaser or
Acquired Companies control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Parent; provided, however, the Parent shall give notice of such Combined Tax
Claim to Purchaser within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice.
If Purchaser determines a settlement or final determination of such Combined
Tax Claim might adversely affect Purchaser, its Affiliates or any Acquired
Company after Closing, the Parent shall permit Purchaser to participate in
the defense of such Combined Tax Claim and shall not settle the Claim without
the consent of Purchaser, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

  

(c) With respect to Straddle Periods, the Parent may elect to direct and
control, through counsel of its own choosing, any Tax Claim involving any
asserted Tax liability with respect to which indemnity may be sought from the
Parent pursuant to Section 7.02. If the Parent elects to direct a Tax Claim,
the Parent shall within 90 days of receipt of the notice of asserted
Tax liability notify the Purchaser of its intent to do so, and the Purchaser
shall cooperate and shall cause the Acquired Companies to fully cooperate, at
the Parents expense, in each phase of such Tax Claim. If the Parent elects
not to direct the Tax Claim, the Purchaser may assume control of such Tax
Claim (at the Purchasers expense). However, in such case, none of the
Purchaser or any Acquired Company may settle or compromise any asserted
liability without prior written consent of the Parent; provided, however,
that consent to settlement or compromise shall not be unreasonably withheld.
In any event, the Parent may participate, at its own expense, in the Tax
Claim. 

  

(d) The Purchaser and the Parent agree to cooperate, and the Purchaser agrees
to cause the Acquired Companies to cooperate, in the defense against or
compromise of any claim in any Tax Claim. 

  

Section 7.05 _Preparation of Tax Returns_. (a) The Parent shall prepare and
file (or cause the Acquired Companies to prepare and file) all Tax Returns
relating to the Acquired Companies for taxable periods ending on or before
the Closing Date; provided, however, that the Parent shall permit the
Purchaser to review and comment on each such Tax Return filed after
the Closing Date which is a separate Tax Return of one or more of the
Acquired Companies. With respect to a combined or consolidated Tax Return
filed after the Closing Date which includes income, gain, loss, deduction or
credit of any Acquired Company and the Parent or its Affiliates, the
Parent shall prepare a pro forma return of each Acquired Company and shall
permit Purchaser to review and comment on such return. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) The Purchaser shall prepare and file (or cause the Acquired Companies to
prepare and file) all Tax Returns that relate to the Acquired Companies for
taxable periods ending after the Closing Date (including Straddle Periods).
Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with those prepared
for prior taxable periods unless a different treatment of any item is required
by Law. With respect to any Tax Return required to be filed with respect to
any Acquired Company after the Closing Date and as to which Taxes are
allocable to the Seller under Section 7.02 hereof, the Purchaser shall
provide the Parent and its authorized representative with a copy of
such completed Tax Return and a statement (with which the Purchaser will make
available supporting schedules and information) certifying the amount of Tax
shown on such Tax Return that is allocable to the Parent pursuant to Section
7.02 at least 30 days prior to the due date (including any extension thereof)
for filing of such Tax Return, and the Parent and its authorized
representative shall have the right to review and comment on such Tax Return
and statement prior to the filing of such Tax Return. The Parent and the
Purchaser agree to consult and to attempt in good faith to resolve any issues
arising as a result of the review of such Tax Return and statement by the
Parent or its authorized representative. 

  

Section 7.06 _Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. The Parent, Seller
and the Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation and
information as either of them reasonably may request of the other (and the
Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies to provide such cooperation and
information) in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim
for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes
or participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of
Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of
relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with related work papers
and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing
authorities. The Parent and the Purchaser shall make themselves (and their
respective employees) reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide explanations of any documents or information provided under this
_Section 7.06_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.02_ ,
each of the Parent and the Purchaser shall retain all Tax Returns, work papers
and all material records or other documents in its possession (or in the
possession of its Affiliates) relating to Tax matters of the Acquired
Companies for any taxable period that includes the Closing Date and for all
prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute
of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other
documents relate, without regard to extensions or (ii) six years following
the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. After such time,
before the Parent or the Purchaser shall dispose of any such documents in its
possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates), the other party shall be
given an opportunity, after 90 days prior written notice, to remove and
retain all or any part of such documents as such other party may select (at
such other partys expense). Any information obtained under this _Section
7.05_ shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary
in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in
conducting an audit or other proceeding. 

  

Section 7.07 _Conveyance Taxes_. The Purchaser shall be liable for, shall hold
the Parent and its Affiliates harmless against, and agrees to pay any and all
Conveyance Taxes that may be imposed upon, or payable or collectible or
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Purchaser and the Parent agree to cooperate in the execution and
delivery of all instruments and certificates necessary to enable the Purchaser
to comply with any pre-Closing filing requirements. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 7.08 _Tax Covenants_. (a) Neither the Purchaser nor any Affiliate of
the Purchaser shall take, or cause or permit any Acquired Company to take,
any action or omit to take any action which could increase the Parents or
any of its Affiliates liability for Taxes. 

  

(b) Neither the Purchaser nor any Affiliate of the Purchaser shall amend,
refile or otherwise modify, or cause or permit the Company to amend, refile
or otherwise modify, any Tax election or Tax Return with respect to any
taxable period (or portion of any taxable period), ending on or before the
Closing Date unless required by Law without the prior written consent of the
Parent. 

   

Section 7.09 _338(h)(10) Election and Purchase Price Allocation_. 

  

(a) Seller shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all forms
and documents required to effectuate an election under Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code (the "Section 338(h)(10) Election") and shall provide the Purchaser
with a copy of such filings for Purchasers review and comment at least sixty
(60) days prior to the due date therefore, taking into account any
timely filed extensions of time to file such filings. In addition to the Form
8023 and any other corresponding or similar forms required under state, local
or foreign Tax Law, the parties shall execute and deliver such additional
documents or forms as are reasonably requested to properly complete the
Section 338(h)(10) Election at least thirty (30) days prior to the date such
Section 338(h)(10) Election is required to be filed. 

  

(b) Parent and the Purchaser shall file and shall cause their Affiliates to
file, all Tax Returns and reports in connection therewith in a manner
consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and shall take no position
contrary thereto unless required to do so by applicable Tax Laws. 

  

(c) The Parent and the Seller shall report on their Tax Returns and shall be
responsible for the payment of any Taxes payable as a result of, any income,
gain, loss, deduction or other Tax item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10)
Election. 

  

(d) (A) Prior to the Closing Parent and the Purchaser shall work together in
good faith to prepare a statement (the "Initial Allocation Statement")
allocating the Purchase Price among the Assets and the Acquired Companies.
The Initial Allocation Statement shall be attached hereto as Section 7.09 of
the Disclosure Schedule on the Closing Date. (B) Within sixty-five (65)
Business Days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide to Parent a
statement (the "Adjusted Allocation Statement") allocating the Purchase Price
and any other items, including liabilities of the Acquired Companies that are
treated as additional Purchase Price for Tax purposes (collectively, the
"Section 338(h)(10) Purchase Price") among the Assets and the
Acquired Companies. Purchaser shall prepare the Adjusted Allocation Statement
in a manner that is consistent with the Initial Allocation Statement, unless
Purchaser obtains the consent of the Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). (C) The Parent shall have
thirty (30) days after receipt of the Adjusted Allocation Statement to notify
Purchaser in writing of any objections. If Parent does not object in writing
during such thirty (30) day period, the Adjusted Allocation Statement shall
be final and binding on all parties. If the Parent objects in writing during
such thirty (30) day period, the parties shall cooperate in good faith
to reach a mutually agreeable allocation of the Section 338(h)(10) 

 

    ##### 

  

 

Purchase Price, which allocation shall be binding on all parties. If the
parties are unable to reach an agreement, any disputed items shall be
referred to an independent accounting firm or appraiser for resolution, and
the determination of the independent accounting firm or appraiser shall be
final and binding on all parties. The fees and expenses of the independent
accounting firm shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Parent and fifty percent
(50%) by the Purchaser. (D) Parent and the Purchaser agree to file all Tax
Returns (including IRS Form 8883) and reports consistent with the foregoing.
If any Tax authority disputes the allocation of the Section 338(h)(10)
Purchase Price as reflected on the final Adjusted Allocation Statement, the
party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other
party. 

  

Section 7.10 _Miscellaneous_. (a) For Tax purposes, the parties agree to treat
all payments made under this _Article VII_, under any other indemnity
provisions contained in this Agreement, and for any breaches of
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements, as adjustments to the
Purchase Price or as capital contributions. 

  

(b) This _Article VII_ shall be the sole provision governing indemnities for
Taxes under this Agreement. 

  

(c) For purposes of this _Article VII_, all references to the Purchaser, the

payments permitted to be made thereunder on and after the Closing Date.

_however_ , that any claim made with reasonable specificity by the party
seeking to be indemnified within the time periods set forth in this _Section
9.01_ shall survive until such claim is finally and fully resolved. 

 

 Section 9.02 _Indemnification by the Parent_. The Purchaser and its
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns
(each, a " _Purchaser Indemnified _

against all losses, damages, claims, costs and expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties (including reasonable attorneys and consultants
fees and expenses) actually suffered or incurred by them (hereinafter, a "
_Loss_ "), arising out of or resulting from: (i) the breach of
any representation or warranty made by the Parent contained in this
Agreement; _provided_ , that for purposes of determining whether there has
been a breach of the representation or warranty made in _Section 3.10(a)_ or

pursuant to this  _Article IX_, there shall be deducted from such Loss an
amount equal to any net Tax benefit (including the utilization of a Tax
deduction or the availability of any future tax benefit) resulting from such
Loss to the party claiming such Loss or indemnification. The amount of a
net Tax benefit shall be the present value of the Tax benefit as of the date
of any indemnification payment (using the interest rate calculation of
Section 6621(a)(2) of the Code and assuming the Indemnified Party has
sufficient Taxable income or other Tax attributes to permit the

matter of such claim or Action on or prior to the date on which the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on which such claim or Action

any individual item where the Loss relating thereto is less than $10,000 and
in respect of each individual item where the Loss relating thereto is equal
to or greater than $10,000, unless and until the aggregate amount of all such
indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from the Indemnifying Party equals

and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of
which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises. 

 

(b) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action, audit, claim,
demand or assessment (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against it which may
give rise to a claim for Loss under this _Article IX_, within 30 days of the
receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying
Party notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this _Article IX_ except to the extent that such
failure results in a detriment to the Indemnifying Party and shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any other Liability that it 

 

    ##### 

  

  

may have to any Indemnified Party other than under this _Article IX_. The

such Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice if it
gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within 15
days of the receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to undertake any such defense against a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own
expense. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in
such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at
the Indemnifying Partys expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials
and information in the Indemnified Partys possession or under the
Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to direct the defense of
any such claim or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit
to be paid, any part of such Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party
consents in writing to such payment or unless the Indemnifying Party
withdraws from the defense of such Third Party Claim liability or unless a
final judgment from which no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of
the Indemnifying Party is entered against the Indemnified Party for such
Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of any such
claims or proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.06_ and proposes to settle
such claims or proceeding prior to a final judgment thereon or to forgo any
appeal with respect thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof and the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to participate in the settlement or assume or reassume
the defense of such claims or proceeding. 

  

Section 9.07 _Remedies_. The Purchaser and the Parent acknowledge and agree
that (i) following the Closing, except in the case of fraud, the
indemnification provisions of _Section 9.02_ and _Section 9.03_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedies of the Purchaser, the Parent and the Seller for
any breach by the other party of the representations and warranties in this
Agreement and for any failure by the other party to perform and comply with
any covenants and agreements in this Agreement, except that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their terms
or are otherwise breached, the parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms thereof in addition to any other remedy at Law or
equity, and (ii) anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall
give rise to any right on the part of the Purchaser, the Parent or the
Seller, after the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Stock
contemplated by this Agreement, to rescind this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each party hereto shall take all reasonable
steps to mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event which
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses. 

  

Section 9.08 _Director and Officer Release_. Purchaser shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to release each director or officer of the Company or
its Subsidiaries who resigns at the Closing (or before the Closing at the

Company or its Subsidiaries as a director or officer thereof arising on or
before the Closing other than liabilities arising from his gross negligence,
recklessness, criminal conduct or self-dealing. Parent and Seller shall
release each director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries from any
and all liability the same may have to the Parent or Seller as a director or
officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries arising on or before the Closing. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 9.09 _Tax Matters_. Anything in this _Article IX_ to the
contrary notwithstanding, the rights and obligations of the parties with
respect to indemnification for any and all Tax matters shall be solely

_Article IX_. 

  

Section 9.10 _Applicability of Article IX_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
parties agree that the remedies and obligations under this _Article IX_
apply only following the Closing, and that prior to the Closing or in the
event that this Agreement is terminated, the parties remedies will be

Section 11.03 _Public Announcements_. Neither party to this Agreement shall
make, or cause to be made, any press release or public announcement in
respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise communicate with any news media without the prior written
consent of the other party unless otherwise required by Law or applicable

internal announcements regarding this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby to their respective directors, officers and employees.
The parties to this Agreement shall cooperate as to the timing and contents
of any and all press releases, filings, public announcements or other
communications. 

  

Section 11.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect for so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to either party hereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

  

Section 11.05 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect

Section 11.08 _Waiver_. Any party to this Agreement may (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other party contained herein or in any document delivered by the other
party pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
of the other party or conditions to such partys obligations contained
herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of
any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a
waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. The failure of any
party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a
waiver of any of such rights.

upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or

OF SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE DEFENSE OF AN INCONVENIENT FORUM TO
