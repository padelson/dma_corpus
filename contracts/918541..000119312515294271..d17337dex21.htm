2.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Estimated Statement_. No fewer than three (3) days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and delivered to

calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price consistent with the provisions of
this Article II and such determination of the Actual Adjustment shall, absent
manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. The Closing
Statement shall be prepared in good faith, and shall reasonably specify each
item taken into account in Purchasers proposed calculation of the Purchase

and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If
Purchaser and Seller, notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to resolve
such dispute within thirty (30) days after Seller advises Purchaser of

 



21  its objections, then Purchaser and Seller jointly shall engage either
Deloitte and Touche LLP or KPMG LLP, provided that if Deloitte and Touche LLP and

mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and Seller (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") to

shall cause the Accounting Firm to choose one of the parties positions based
solely upon the presentations by Purchaser and Seller. Purchaser and Seller
shall instruct the Accounting Firm to make its determination based solely on
presentations by Purchaser and Seller that are in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the
basis of an independent review). The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm

on the merits in the resolution of the items in dispute. All determinations
made by the Accounting Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties, and not subject to any further adjustment under Article IX or
otherwise. The Closing Statement shall be revised as appropriate to reflect
the resolution of any objections thereto pursuant to this Section 2.3(c) and,
as so revised, such Closing Statement shall be deemed to set forth the final
Closing Working Capital, Closing Working Capital Adjustment, Closing Cash,
Closing Transaction Tax Benefits, Closing Assumed Indebtedness, Company
Transaction Expenses and Final Purchase Price, in each case, for all purposes
hereunder (including the determination of the Actual Adjustment). The
procedures set forth in this Section 2.3 for resolving disputes in this
Section 2.3 shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such
dispute.

 

(d) _Access_. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this
Section 2.3, each party shall cooperate with and make available to the other
parties and their respective representatives all information, records, data
and working papers prepared by such party and in such partys possession, and
shall permit access to its facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably
required in connection with the preparation and analysis of the Closing
Statement and the resolution of any disputes thereunder.

 

(e) _Adjustment_.

 

(i) If the Actual Adjustment is a negative amount, then Seller and Purchaser
shall deliver a joint written authorization to the Escrow Agent within two
(2) Business Days from the date on which the Purchase Price is finally
determined pursuant to Section 2.3(c), authorizing the Escrow Agent to release
from the Adjustment Escrow (i) to Purchaser an amount in cash equal to the
absolute value of the Actual Adjustment (plus interest on such amount at the
rate of 5% per annum from the Closing Date to the date of payment) and (ii) to
Seller the remainder, if any, of the funds designated for the Adjustment
Escrow. If the negative Actual Adjustment exceeds the amount held for the
Adjustment Escrow, then such additional deficiency shall be paid to Purchaser
by the Seller in the form of a release of such amount from the Indemnification
Escrow. The amount

 



22  payable to Purchaser after the Closing pursuant to this Section 2.3(e)(i)
shall be limited solely to the available funds in the Adjustment Escrow and
Indemnification Escrow.

 

(ii) If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount, then, within two (2)
Business Days from the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined
pursuant to Section 2.3(c), (i) Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Seller an amount in cash equal to the Actual Adjustment (plus interest on such
amount at the rate of 5% per annum from the Closing Date to the date of
payment) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by Seller to Purchaser prior to the date such
payment is due hereunder, and (ii) Seller and Purchaser shall deliver a joint
written authorization to the Escrow Agent authorizing the Escrow Agent to
release to Seller all of the funds designated for the Adjustment Escrow.

 

(iii) If the Actual Adjustment is zero, there will be no adjustment to the

the Escrow Agent to release to Seller all of the funds designated for the
Adjustment Escrow.

forth on _Schedule 4.16(a)_ (the " _Owned Real Property_ "). A PEP Company
holds good and marketable fee simple title to the Owned Real Property, free
and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens. The Owned Real Property is
not subject to any option, lease, license, sublease or other occupancy
agreement granting to any third party any right to use, occupy or enjoy any
portion of the Owned Real Property or to obtain title to any portion of the
Owned Real Property. To the Knowledge of the Company, no
condemnation, requisition or taking by any public authority has been
threatened in writing, and no PEP Company has received any written notice of
any such condemnation,

 



39  requisition or taking by a Governmental Body with respect to any part of the
Owned Real Property that is material to the PEP Companies or the PEP
Companies operation or use of such Owned Real Property (as currently
operated or used). All improvements on the Owned Real Property constructed by
or on behalf of any PEP Company were constructed, to the Knowledge of the
Company, in compliance in all material respects with applicable
Laws affecting such Owned Real Property. Each Owned Real Property is, to the
Knowledge of the Company, structurally sound with no known material structural
defects, in adequate operating condition and repair in all material respects
(normal wear and tear excepted) and is sufficient for the operation of the
PEP Companies, as such Owned Real Property is currently being operated by the
PEP Companies.

 

(b) _Leased Real Property_. (i) _Schedule 4.16(b)_ includes a complete and
accurate list of all the real estate used by any PEP Company (the " _Leased
Real Property_ ") as of the date hereof, all of which is held under real
property leases (the " _Real Property Leases_ "). A PEP Company has a valid
leasehold interest in all Leased Real Property.  _Schedule 4.16(b)_ includes
a list of all of the Real Property Leases, copies of which have been made
available to Purchaser. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date
hereof, the PEP Companies activities conducted on the Leased Real Property
are not in material violation of, or in material conflict with, any applicable
zoning regulations or ordinances, except where such conflict or violation
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the ownership, use or operation of each parcel of the Leased Real Property;
and (ii) as of the date hereof, all the Real Property Leases are in full force
and effect, and are valid and enforceable in accordance with their respective
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws in effect which affect
the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by limitations on the
availability of equitable remedies and by equitable principles, and except as
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
operations of the PEP Companies, taken as a whole. As of the date hereof,
there exist no defaults on the part of any PEP Company under any Real
Property Lease nor any state of facts which, upon notice or lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a default under any Real Property Lease that would give
the other party or parties the right to terminate such Real Property Lease.

(c) _Information Regarding Real Property_. _Schedule 4.16(c)_ lists (i) the
street address of each parcel of Real Property; and (ii) whether such
property is owned by a PEP Company or leased or subleased by a PEP Company (as
lessee or sublessee). With respect to owned Real Property; (A) the Company has
delivered or made available to Purchaser true, complete, and correct copies
of the deeds and other instruments (as recorded), which to the Knowledge of
the Company are in the possession of the Company as of the date hereof, by
which the applicable PEP Company acquired such Real Property, and (B) copies
of all of the most recent title insurance policies, opinions, abstracts, and
surveys which to the Knowledge of the Company are in the possession of the
Company as of the date hereof and relate to such Real Property. Except as
set forth on _Schedule 4.16(c)_, none of the PEP Companies is a sublessor or
grantor under any sublease or other instrument granting to any other Person
any right to the possession, lease, or occupancy of any Leased Real Property.
To the Knowledge of the

 



40  Company the use and operation of the Real Property by the PEP Companies does
not violate in any material respect any Law, covenant, condition, restriction,
easement, license, permit, or agreement (whether binding on the PEP
Companies, the Real Property, or the owner of the same). To the Knowledge of
the Company, no improvements constituting a part of the Real Property encroach
on real property owned or leased by a Person other than a PEP Company. There
are no Legal Proceedings pending nor, to Knowledge of the Company, threatened
in writing against the owned Real Property or any portion thereof in the
nature or in lieu of condemnation or eminent domain proceedings.

properties and assets) good and valid title to or (in the case of leased
assets) a valid leasehold interest in, all of the tangible personal properties

Policies. During the last three (3) years, the PEP Companies have not received
any written notice of a cancellation with respect to any of the Policies.

pending under any of the Policies for amounts in excess of $250,000. During
the last three (3) years, the Company has not defaulted on any payment
obligations pursuant to any of the Policies. All premiums with respect to the
Policies covering all periods up to and including the date hereof have or will
be paid as of the Closing Date.

 

4.20 _Transactions with Affiliates, Related Parties and Others_. Except as set
forth in _Schedule 4.20_ or with respect to any amounts to be repaid or

6.6 _Debt Financing_.

executed debt commitment letter addressed to Purchaser from KeyBanc Capital
Markets, Inc., KeyBank National Association, SunTrust Bank, SunTrust Robinson
Humphrey Inc., Regions Bank and Regions Capital Markets (the "Committed
Lenders") (including all exhibits, annexes, schedules and term sheets thereto
together with each executed fee letter (the "Fee Letter") associated therewith
(which may be redacted in a customary manner, including, without limitation,
with respect to fee amounts, post-closing securities demand provisions,
economic terms, flex terms and required "hold" levels), collectively, the
"Debt Commitment Letter", and the financing contemplated thereby, the "Debt
Financing"), dated on or before the date hereof, pursuant to which the
Committed Lenders have committed, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth therein, to lend Purchaser the amounts set forth therein for the
purpose of financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Purchasers cash on hand, together with the aggregate amount of the funding to
be provided in the Debt Financing (including after giving effect to all
"flex" provisions contained therein), is sufficient to pay all amounts
required to be paid by Purchaser hereunder and all related fees and expenses
hereunder and under the Debt Financing. As of the date hereof, the
Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn
or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect, and no such
amendment or modification is pending or contemplated. The Debt Commitment
Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser and, to the
knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties thereto, except as may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance or similar laws from time to time in effect affecting creditors
rights and remedies generally and by general principles of equity (regardless
of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). Purchaser has
entered into the Engagement Letter 

 



47  (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) contemplated by the last
paragraph of Section 2 of the Debt Commitment Letter (the "Note Engagement
Letter") and such Note Engagement Letter is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Purchaser and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties
thereto, except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws from time
to time in effect affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law). Except for the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Note Engagement Letter (and the related fee credit letter), there are no
other agreements, side letters, undertakings or arrangements relating to the
Debt Financing to which Purchaser is a party. To Purchasers knowledge, no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default or breach on the part of Purchaser under any term
or condition of the Debt Commitment Letter. There are no conditions precedent
or other contingencies, including any subsequent approval process, related to
the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than the Financing
Conditions, and the Debt Commitment Letter does not provide that the parties
thereto may impose additional conditions or other contingences to such
funding. Purchaser has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
required by the Debt Commitment Letter to be paid by it on or prior to the
date hereof. As of the date hereof, Purchaser is not aware of any fact
or occurrence that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to (i) make any of the assumptions or any of the
statements set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material
respect; (ii) result in any of the terms or conditions in the Debt Commitment
Letter not being satisfied; (iii) cause the Debt Commitment Letter to be
ineffective; or (iv) otherwise result in the Debt Financing not being
available on a timely basis in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. None of (x) the provisions redacted in the Fee
Letter, or (y) the provisions of the Note Engagement Letter (or the related
fee credit letter) will limit, prevent, impede or delay the consummation of
the Debt Financing in any manner.

(b) Purchaser confirms that it is not a condition to Closing or any of its
other obligations under this Agreement that Purchaser obtain financing for or
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.7 _Litigation_. There is no legal, administrative arbitral or other
proceeding by or before any Governmental Body or, to the knowledge of
Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser, nor to the knowledge of Purchaser is
there any pending investigation by any Governmental Body, which would give any
third party the right to enjoin or rescind the transactions contemplated
hereby or otherwise prevent Purchaser from complying with the terms and
provision of this Agreement. Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller if any
change, event or condition arises or occurs after the date hereof that would
have made the foregoing representation untrue had such change, event or
condition arisen or occurred on or prior to the date hereof or that could
possibly materially delay the Closing.

 

6.8 _Solvency_. After giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries (including the PEP Companies) shall
collectively be able to pay their debts as they become due and shall own
property having a fair saleable value in the ordinary course of business
greater than the amounts required to pay their debts as they become due.

 



48 6.9 _No Knowledge of Misrepresentations or Omissions_. As of the date
hereof: (a) neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates has any actual
knowledge that the representations and warranties of the Company in this
Agreement and the Disclosure Schedules or otherwise are not true and correct
in all material respects; and (b) neither the Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates has any actual knowledge of any material errors in, or material
omissions from, any Schedule to this Agreement.

review and analysis of, and, based thereon, has formed an independent
judgment concerning, the business, assets, condition and operations of the PEP
Companies and (ii) has been furnished with or given access to such documents
and information about the PEP Companies and their respective businesses
and operations as it has deemed necessary to enable it to make an informed
decision with respect to the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.10 is intended to modify or amend any of

and only upon, the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate.

 



53 7.6 _D andO Protections_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the PEP
Companies to, reimburse, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, the individuals who on or prior to the
Closing Date were directors, managers, officers, employees or any similar
title of any PEP Company (collectively, the " _D andO Indemnitees_") with
respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such, or taken
at the request of a PEP Company, at any time prior to the Closing Date.
Purchaser agrees that all rights of the DandO Indemnitees to indemnification
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Closing Date as provided in the respective certificate of incorporation
or by-laws or comparable organizational documents of any PEP Company as now in
effect, and any indemnification agreements or arrangements of each PEP
Company shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms. Such rights shall not be amended, or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of
the DandO Indemnitees, unless such modification is required by Law. In addition,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the PEP Companies to, pay any expenses of any
DandO Indemnitee under this Section 7.6, as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required
by applicable Law.

 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause each PEP
Company (as applicable) to, cause (i) the certificate of incorporation and
by-laws or comparable organizational documents of Purchaser or such PEP
Company to contain provisions no less favorable to the DandO Indemnitees with
respect to limitation of liabilities of directors, officers, employees
and agents and indemnification than are set forth as of the date hereof in
the certificates of incorporation and by-laws or comparable organizational
documents of the PEP Companies and (ii) the certificate of incorporation and
by-laws or comparable organizational documents of the PEP Companies to retain
the current provisions regarding indemnification of directors, managers,
officers, employees, agents or other similar titles, which provisions in each
case shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the DandO Indemnitees.

(c) Before or on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall purchase a six (6) year
tail policy of the same amount for the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policy, covering those Persons who are covered by the
policy existing prior to the Closing, for all acts or events that occurred up
to and including the Closing Date.

(d) The provisions of this Section 7.6: (i) are for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives; and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have
by Contract or otherwise. The DandO Indemnitees to whom this Section 7.6 applies
shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.6.

 

(e) In the event that Purchaser or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing
or

 



54  surviving Person of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Purchaser shall assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this Section 7.6.

 

(f) The obligations of Purchaser under this Section 7.6 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO
Indemnitee to whom this Section 7.6 applies without the consent of the
affected DandO Indemnitee.

7.7 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto will, and will cause each of
their Affiliates and representatives to, maintain the confidentiality of this
Agreement and will not, and will cause each of their Affiliates not to, issue
or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
the prior written consent of the other party hereto, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld; _provided, however_ , that a party may, without the
prior consent of the other party, issue or cause publication of any such press
release or public announcement to the extent that such party reasonably
determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel, such action to be
required by Law or stock exchange regulations, in which event such party will
use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to
comment on such press release or public announcement; and  _provided,
further_ , that the TJC, Nautic and each of their respective Affiliates may
(a) identify the PEP Companies as former portfolio companies and indicate that
they were sold to Purchaser (without disclosure of the Purchase Price)
on their respective websites, in their marketing materials and in their press
releases, (b) provide financial results achieved by TJC, Nautic and each of
their respective Affiliates with respect to their beneficial interest in the
PEP Companies or (c) provide a general description of the PEP Companies
(including their financial performance, and TJCs, Nautics and their
respective Affiliates investment and role therein), to the current or
prospective limited partners or other business affiliates of TJC, Nautic and
each of their respective Affiliates and their respective advisors.

7.8 _Access and Information_.

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing, subject to Section 7.1 and to
reasonable rules, regulations and policies of Seller and any applicable Laws,
Seller shall (i) afford Purchaser and its representatives reasonable access,
during regular business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to Seller, to
the PEP Companies and to the employees specified by Seller in connection with
each such visit; _provided, however_ , access to such employees will only be
available upon reasonable notice to Seller to the attention of John Manzi and
at such times and places as John Manzi shall determine in his reasonable
discretion. Any access shall be conducted (A) under the supervision of
Sellers or its Affiliates personnel, (B) subject to all of the standard
protocols and procedures of the PEP Companies, including the requirement that
visitors be escorted at all times, (C) subject to any additional procedures
required by any landlord, and (D) in such a manner as does not unreasonably
interfere with the normal operations of the PEP Companies. All such access
shall be at the risk of Purchaser and its representatives and agents, and in
connection therewith, Purchaser hereby agrees to

 



55  indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, members, agents, representatives, successors and assigns
with respect to any Damages resulting from or arising out of such access.

(b) Following the Closing and until any applicable statute of limitations
(including periods of waiver) has expired, Purchaser agrees to retain all
Books and Records in existence on the Closing Date and to grant to Seller and
its representatives during regular business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice to Purchaser, the right, at the expense of Seller, (i) to inspect and
copy the Books and Records and (ii) to have personnel of Purchaser made
available to them or to otherwise cooperate to the extent reasonably requested
by Seller, including in connection with (A) preparing and filing Tax returns
and/or any Tax inquiry, audit, investigation or dispute, or (B) any
litigation, audit, dispute, claim or investigation.

 

7.9 _Tax Matters_.

(a)  _Tax Covenants_.

(i) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added,
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the Company Documents (including any
real property transfer Tax and any other similar Tax) shall be borne and paid
by the Purchaser when due. The Purchaser shall, and shall cause the PEP
Companies to, at their own expense, timely file any Tax Return or other
document with respect to such Taxes or fees (and Seller shall cooperate with
respect thereto as necessary).

 

(ii) Purchaser shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to
be filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the PEP Companies after the
Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period.
Any such Tax Return prepared prior to the final determination of the Closing
Assumed Indebtedness pursuant to Section 2.3(c) or with respect to which
Seller may have any continuing liability pursuant to Section 9.2 shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required
by Law) and without a change of any election or any accounting method and
shall be submitted by Purchaser to the Seller (together with schedules,
statements and, to the extent requested by the Seller, supporting
documentation) at least thirty-five (35) days before the due date (including
extensions) of such Tax Return. If the Seller objects to any item on any such
Tax Return, it shall, within fifteen (15) days after delivery of such Tax
Return, notify Purchaser in writing that it so objects, specifying any such
item and stating the basis for any such objection. If a notice of objection
shall be duly delivered, Purchaser and the Seller shall negotiate in good
faith and use their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such items. If
Purchaser and Seller are unable to reach such agreement within ten (10) days
after receipt by Purchaser of such notice, the disputed items shall be
resolved by the Accounting Firm, and any determination by the Accounting Firm
shall be final. The Accounting Firm shall resolve any disputed items within
ten (10) days of

 



56  having the item referred to it pursuant to such procedures as it may
require. If the Accounting Firm is unable to resolve any disputed items before
the due date for such Tax Return, the Tax Return shall be filed as prepared
by Purchaser (incorporating such changes as have been agreed pursuant to this
Section 7.9(a)(ii)) and then amended to reflect the Accounting Firms
resolution. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm under this Section
7.9(a)(ii) shall be borne by Purchaser and Seller in inverse proportion to
their success on the merits in the resolution of the items in dispute.

 

(iii) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall (or shall cause or
permit any PEP Company to) amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return
relating in whole or in part to any PEP Company with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period (or with respect to any Straddle Period) without the
written consent of Seller, which consent may be withheld in the
sole discretion of Seller.

(b) _Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements_. Except for any existing
Tax sharing agreements between or among the PEP Companies, any and all
existing Tax sharing agreements binding upon the PEP Companies shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date. After such date, none of the PEP Companies
shall have any further rights or liabilities thereunder. 

(c) _Contests_.

 

(i) After the Closing, each party to this Agreement (whether Purchaser or the
Seller, as the case may be) shall promptly notify the other party in writing
of any demand, claim or notice of the commencement of an audit received by
such party from any Governmental Body or any other Person with respect to
Taxes for which such other party is liable pursuant to Section 9.2 or Section
9.3 of this Agreement; provided, however, that a failure to give such notice
will not affect such other partys rights to indemnification under Article IX,
except to the extent that such party is actually prejudiced thereby. Such
notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known) describing the
asserted Tax liability and shall include copies of the relevant portion of any
notice or other document received from any Governmental Body or any other
Person in respect of any such asserted Tax liability.

(ii) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to control
the conduct, through counsel of its own choosing at its own expense, of any
Action, audit, claim for refund, or administrative or judicial proceeding
involving any asserted Tax liability or refund with respect to any PEP Company
(any such Action, audit, claim for refund, or proceeding relating to an
asserted Tax liability in respect of which an indemnity may be sought by
Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.2(a) referred to herein as a "Tax Claim")
relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods. 

(d) _Procedure Regarding Tax Claims_. In the case of any Tax Claim with
respect to any PEP Company with respect to any Straddle Period, or any Pre-
Closing Tax Period which Seller has not elected to control pursuant to Section
7.9(c),

 



57  Purchaser shall control the conduct of such Tax Claim, but Seller shall have
the right to participate in such Tax Claim at its own expense and, with the
written consent of Purchaser, in Purchasers sole discretion, and at its
expense, may assume control of the conduct of such Tax Claim. Neither
Purchaser, nor the PEP Companies shall settle, compromise and/or concede such
Tax Claim without the consent of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. If Purchaser fails to assume
control of the conduct of any such Tax Claim within a reasonable period
following the receipt by Purchaser of notice of such Tax Claim, Seller shall
have the right to assume control of such Tax Claim and shall be able to
settle, compromise and/or concede such Tax Claim in its sole discretion

 

(e) _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Seller and Purchaser shall
provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them
reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return pursuant to this
Section 7.9 or in connection with any audit or other proceeding in respect of
Taxes of the PEP Companies. Such cooperation and information shall include
providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with
accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents relating to rulings
or other determinations by tax authorities. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall
retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records, and other
documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the PEP Companies for
any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of
the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns
and other documents relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent
notified by the other party in writing of such extensions for the respective
Tax periods. Before transferring, destroying, or discarding any Tax Returns,
schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its possession
relating to Tax matters of the PEP Companies for any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date, Seller or Purchaser (as the case may be) shall
provide the other party with reasonable written notice and offer the other
party the opportunity to take custody of such materials. Any information
obtained under this Section 7.9 shall be kept confidential, except as may be
otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in the
conduct of a Tax Claim or other Tax proceeding.

(f) _Tax Elections_. Purchaser shall not, without the prior consent of Seller
(which may, in its sole and absolute discretion, withhold such consent), make,
or cause to permit to be made, any Tax election, or adopt or change any method
of accounting, or undertake any extraordinary action on the Closing Date,
that would affect the Seller or any PEP Company for any period or portion
thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

(g) _Overlap_. To the extent that any obligation or responsibility pursuant to
Article IX may overlap with an obligation or responsibility pursuant to this
Section 7.9, the provisions of this Section 7.9 shall govern.

(h) _No 338 Election_. Purchaser shall not make any election under Section
338 of the Code (or any similar provision under state, local, or foreign Law)
with respect to the acquisition of the Company and its Affiliates.

 



58 (i) _Consolidated Group Issues_. Purchaser and Seller intend that the Company
will join Purchasers U.S. consolidated Tax group upon the Purchasers
acquisition of the Shares and as a result the Tax year of the Company will end
for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the Closing Date. Seller and Purchaser
agree that the U.S. federal income Tax Return of the PEP Companies for such
taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall be prepared in accordance with
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii) and that (x) none of
Purchaser, Seller, Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall make a
ratable allocation election under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)
or any analogous provision of state, local or foreign Law, and (y) in
accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76 and any analogous
provision of state, local or foreign Law, any Tax imposed with respect to any
transaction not within the ordinary course of business that Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, Company or any PEP Company)
causes to occur on the Closing Date after the Closing shall be the
responsibility of Purchaser and shall be allocable to the taxable period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date for all purposes of
this Agreement.

7.10 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) From the date hereof through the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article X and the Closing, as applicable, Seller shall
not and shall cause each of the PEP Companies and its and their
representatives not to, directly or indirectly (except with respect to
Purchaser and its Affiliates), solicit or invite any inquiries, proposals or
indications of interest, or enter into any discussions, negotiations,
understandings, arrangements or contracts relating to the direct or indirect
disposition, whether by sale, merger or otherwise, of all or any material
portion of the PEP Companies or their respective businesses or assets or the
Shares or any other capital stock of any PEP Company.

(b) From the date hereof through the earlier of the Closing Date and the date
of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article X, as applicable, Seller
shall not conduct any discussions or negotiations, and shall cause the PEP
Companies and representatives to, cease and terminate immediately
any existing discussions or negotiations with respect to or in furtherance of
any transaction described in clause (a) above.

7.11 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that (a) the PEP Companies and Seller are not making any representations or
warranties whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly given by
the Company in Article IV (as modified by the Disclosure Schedules hereto as
supplemented or amended) and those expressly given by Seller in Article V (as
modified by the Disclosure Schedules hereto as supplemented or amended), and
(b) except for the representations and warranties contained in such provisions
of this Agreement, the assets and the business of the PEP Companies are being
transferred on a "where is" and, as to condition, "as is" basis. Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that none of the PEP Companies, nor Seller or any of
their respective Affiliates nor any other Person has made any representation
or 

 



59  warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding the PEP Companies, or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement not expressly set forth within this Agreement, and Purchaser
is not relying on anything other than the express provisions of this Agreement
in entering into this Agreement. None of the PEP Companies, nor Seller, any of
their respective Affiliates or any other Person will have or be subject to
any liability to Purchaser or any other Person resulting from the distribution
to Purchaser or its representatives of or Purchasers use of, any such
information, including any confidential memoranda distributed on behalf
of Seller or the PEP Companies relating to the PEP Companies or other
publications, representations, warranties, forecasts, statements or
information, including any information provided in a "data room", "management
presentation", "break-out session" or otherwise to Purchaser or its
Affiliates or representatives, or any other document or information in any
form provided to Purchaser or its representatives in connection with the Share
Sale and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees that the representations and warranties made by the PEP Companies
and Seller in this Agreement (as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules)
supersede, replace and nullify in every respect all other information,
whether written or oral, made available to Purchaser, its Affiliates or its
representatives.

7.12 _Compliance with Connecticut Transfer Act_. Seller and Purchaser agree
and acknowledge that this stock purchase transaction constitutes a "transfer
of an establishment" under the CT Act with respect to the Site. Prior to the
Closing Seller and Purchaser shall work together to cause the PEP Companies
to (a) engage a Connecticut Licensed Environmental Professional to prepare an
Environmental Condition Assessment Form (" _ECAF_ ") for the Site and any
other documents that may be required pursuant to the CT Act or by the CTDEP
as a result of the consummation of this stock purchase transaction and (b)
deliver a copy of the ECAF and such other documents to Seller and Purchaser.
The EFAC shall state that Lacey and the other PEP Companies may rely on the
EFAC. After the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the PEP Companies to file a
Form III and an ECAF with the CTDEP and otherwise comply with the applicable
provisions of the CT Act in connection with this stock purchase transaction,
including without limitation completing and filing at or promptly following
the Closing all forms and documents required by the CT Act in connection
herewith, causing Lacey to execute the same as the Certifying Party (as
that term is defined under the CT Act), pursuant to which Lacey shall pay all
applicable filing fees associated therewith, and conduct and complete at
Laceys expense all investigation and remediation of environmental conditions
as required under the CT Act. Lacey shall be responsible for the costs of
investigation of environmental conditions as required under the CT Act, and
shall assume all CT Act Liabilities; _provided_ that Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchaser obligations to
cause the PEP Companies to prepare and file any forms required under this
Section 7.12.

7.13  _Employees and Benefits_.

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause the PEP Companies to, provide each Closing Date Business Employee
(including, without limitation, those on temporary layoffs or approved leaves

 



60  of absence) with job responsibilities, wages, compensation and other
employee benefits (not including any executive-level benefit) in the aggregate
not materially less favorable than those applicable to each such Closing Date
Business Employee immediately before the Closing Date.

(b) On or after Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible for any and all
notices, liabilities, costs, payments and expenses arising from any action by
Purchaser or the PEP Companies occurring after the Closing (including breach
of contract, defamation or retaliatory discharge) regarding any Closing Date
Business Employee, including any such liability (i) under any applicable Law
that relates to employees, employee benefit matters or labor matters, (ii) for
dismissal, wrongful termination or constructive dismissal or termination, or
severance pay or other termination pay, or (iii) under or with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan, program, contract, policy, commitment, or arrangement of
the PEP Companies, including with respect to severance or retention plans, or
to the extent such severance or retention plans provide payments or benefits
with respect to any Business Employee; _provided, however_ , that the
foregoing obligations of Purchaser and the PEP Companies shall be subject
to Section 11.8.

(c) In any termination or layoff of any Closing Date Business Employee by
Purchaser or the PEP Companies on or after the Closing, Purchaser and the PEP
Companies will comply fully, if applicable, with the WARN Act and all other
applicable foreign, federal state and local laws, including those prohibiting
discrimination and requiring notice to employees. Purchaser shall not, and
shall cause the PEP Companies not to, at any time prior to sixty (60) days
after the Closing Date, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as
those terms are defined in the WARN Act) affecting in whole or in part any
facility, site of employment, operating unit or employee of the PEP Companies
without complying fully with the requirements of the WARN Act. Purchaser and
the PEP Companies will bear the cost of compliance with (or failure to comply
with) any such Laws.

(d) For periods on and after the Closing Date, the PEP Companies shall
continue to have all obligations and liabilities under and with respect to
the Company Benefit Plans and to or with respect to all persons entitled to
benefits under the provisions of each such Company Benefit Plan, including,
without limitation, the obligation to provide or make available welfare
benefits to retired or disabled employees of the PEP Companies.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing contained in
this Section 7.13, whether express or implied, shall (i) confer upon any
employee of Purchaser or any PEP Company any entitlement, rights, or remedies
(including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified
period), of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Section
7.13 or (ii) restrict Purchaser or any PEP Company from terminating the
employment of any individual, including without limitation any Business
Employee or Closing Date Business Employee. No provision of this Section 7.13
is intended to modify, amend or create any employee benefit plan of Purchaser
or any PEP Company.

 



61 7.14 _Financing_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts (and Purchaser shall cause
each of its subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts) to obtain the
Debt Financing at Closing on the terms and conditions (including flex
provisions) described in the Debt Commitment Letter (provided that Purchaser
may amend, restate, supplement or otherwise modify the Debt Commitment
Letter, including, without limitation (x) to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof or (y) to implement any flex
provisions applicable thereto provided that no such amendment, restatement,
supplement or modification shall be permitted if, in any such case, taking
into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period, such amendment,
restatement, supplement or modification would reasonably be expected to (i)
delay or prevent the Closing, (ii) impose any additional conditions to the
Debt Financing or amend or modify any Financing Condition in a manner
materially adverse to the Purchaser or Seller (iii) modify or amend the date
on which the commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter expire or terminate
in any manner that results in such date of expiration or termination becoming
a date earlier than the date specified in the Debt Commitment Letter or (iv)
adversely impact the ability of the Purchaser to enforce its rights under the
Debt Commitment Letter), including using reasonable best efforts to (1) take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things (other than the commencement of litigation or Legal Proceedings)
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable in connection therewith, (2)
maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and the Note Engagement Letter
until the consummation of the Closing hereunder, (3) taking into account the
expected timing of the Marketing Period, satisfy on a timely basis all of the
Financing Conditions and any other conditions to the Debt Financing in the
Debt Commitment Letter (including promptly preparing and furnishing to the
Committed Lenders and the Financial Institutions (as defined in the Debt
Commitment Letter) the Purchaser Financing Information), and otherwise comply
in all material respects with its obligations under the Debt Commitment
Letter, (4) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms
and conditions (including, to the extent the same are exercised, the flex
provisions) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or on other
terms acceptable to Purchaser that would not (I) reduce the aggregate amount
of the Debt Financing or (II) impose any new or additional conditions
precedent to the receipt of the Debt Financing or modify or amend any
Financing Condition, (5) if all of the conditions to funding in the Debt
Commitment Letter have been satisfied or waived, consummate the Debt Financing
at Closing and (6) so long as the conditions in the immediately preceding
clause (5) have been satisfied, enforce (other than the commencement of
litigation or Legal Proceedings) their rights under the Debt Commitment
Letter, and (6) comply with, and fulfill all of its obligations under, the
Note Engagement Letter. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Purchaser shall give the Company prompt notice: (A) of any material breach or
default by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter; (B) of the receipt of any
written notice or other written communication from any Debt Financing Source
with respect to any (x) breach, default, termination or repudiation of the
Debt Commitment Letter by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or (y)
material dispute between or among Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Debt
Financing Sources, on the other hand, with respect to the availability

 



62  of the Debt Financing; (C) if for any reason Purchaser believes in good
faith that (x) there is a material dispute between or among Purchaser, on the
one hand, and the Debt Financing Sources, on the other hand, with respect to
the availability of the Debt Financing or (y) there is a material possibility
that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on
the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter; and (D) if for any reason any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter; provided that neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
shall be under any obligation to disclose any information to the extent that
(1) such information is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege (but
only if such privilege is asserted in good faith) or (2) the disclosure of
which would be prohibited or restricted by applicable Law. As soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event within three (3) Business Days, after
the date the Company delivers to Purchaser a written request, Purchaser
shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to
any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B), (C) or (D) of the immediately
preceding sentence. Without the prior written consent of the Company,
Purchaser shall not permit any assignment of rights or obligations under the
Debt Commitment Letter. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Purchaser shall promptly notify
the Company and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative
financing from alternative sources (the "Alternative Financing") in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event; it being
understood that (x) Purchaser shall have no obligation to accept terms that
are materially less favorable, taken as a whole (after taking into account
any flex provisions), to Purchaser than those included in the Debt Commitment
Letter as of the date hereof, and (y) without the prior written consent of the
Company, the Purchaser shall not obtain any Alternative Financing
that contains any conditions or contingencies to the funding thereof other
than the Financing Conditions as in effect on the date hereof. Purchaser shall
keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
(subject to any applicable restrictions in the Debt Commitment Letter).
Purchaser shall promptly provide a true, correct and complete copy of any
Alternative Financing commitment (together with a copy of any related fee
letter with only the fee amount redacted), and, to the extent applicable,
thereafter (x) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall
include the debt financing contemplated by such commitment letters (including
fee letters) for the Alternative Financing, (y) any reference in this
Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter" or the "Committed Lenders" shall be
deemed to be the commitment letters (including fee letters) for the
Alternative Financing and the lenders or other providers of such Alternative
Financing, respectively, and (z) any reference in this Agreement to the
Financing Conditions shall include the conditions to the Alternative
Financing set forth in the commitment letters for the Alternative Financing
referred to in the prior clause (y). For purposes of this Agreement, the
definitions of "Debt Commitment Letter," "Debt Financing" and related
definitions shall include the Debt Commitment Letter and, if entered into
prior to Closing, any document related thereto as the same may be amended,
waived, modified or replaced pursuant to this Section 7.14(a).

 



63 (b) Until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article X, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts (and
the Company shall cause each of its Company Subsidiaries to use their
reasonable best efforts) to provide Purchaser, and shall use each of their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to provide
Purchaser, in each case, with Purchasers reimbursement of reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith (in accordance with
the reimbursement provisions of Section 11.2), all customary cooperation
reasonably requested by Purchaser that is necessary in connection with
arranging and obtaining the Debt Financing (or, if applicable, any Alternative
Financing) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (provided that
such requested cooperation is consistent with applicable Law), including
using reasonable best efforts in connection with (i) promptly furnishing
Purchaser the Company Financing Information as and when it becomes available,
(ii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings at reasonable times
(including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead
arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Debt
Financing and members of senior management and representatives of the
Company), presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions
and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Debt Financing, in
each case with reasonable advance notice, (iii) assisting Purchaser with the
preparation by Purchaser of (A) offering documents and confidential
information memoranda for any portion of the Debt Financing (including the
"Required Information" as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter (solely to
the extent related to a PEP Company and specifically excluding any Purchaser
Financing Information)) and (B) reasonable and customary materials for rating
agency presentations, bank information memoranda and similar documents
reasonably and customarily required in connection with the Debt Financing
(including the delivery of any consents of accountants for use of their
reports); provided, however, that any offering memorandum, offering documents,
confidential information memorandum, rating agency presentations, bank
information memoranda or similar documents required in connection with the
Debt Financing shall (x) contain disclosure reflecting Purchaser and/or one or
more post-Closing Affiliates thereof as the obligor(s), and (y) contain
disclosures exculpating the Seller, the Company and their respective
Affiliates with respect to any liability related to the contents or use
thereof by the recipients thereof, in each case, other than as set forth in
the customary representation letters to the Companys accountants as
contemplated by (v) below, (iv) executing and delivering, effective as of the
Closing, any pledge and security documents and otherwise facilitating the
pledging of collateral, (v) obtaining customary accountants comfort letters
(including the delivery of customary representation letters to the Companys
accountants in connection therewith), local counsel opinions, and customary
payoff letters and Lien releases in respect of existing Company Indebtedness
of the PEP Companies, in each case, as required by the Debt Commitment Letter
and effective only at the Closing (except with respect to the accountant
comfort letters), and (vi) at least three Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, providing all documentation and other information about the Company as
is reasonably requested in writing by Purchaser at least seven Business Days
prior to the Closing Date in connection with the Debt Financing that relates
to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the USA Patriot Act; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this 

 



64  Agreement, (a) irrespective of the above, nothing in this Section 7.14 shall
require any PEP Company to incur any liability or enter into any binding
certificate, agreement, document or instrument (or to take any action under
any certificate, agreement document or instrument) that is not contingent upon
the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing, (b) nothing
herein shall require such cooperation or actions to the extent it would
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the PEP Companies in
any material respect, (c) none of the PEP Companies shall be required to issue
any offering document, (d) none of the PEP Companies shall be obligated to
provide (and Purchaser shall not disclose) any information about the PEP
Companies to the extent that (1) such information is subject to attorney-
client or similar privilege (but only if such privilege is asserted in good
faith) or (2) the disclosure of which would be prohibited or restricted by
applicable Law or any agreement or contract, (e) nothing in this Section 7.14
shall require Seller or any PEP Company to make any representation or
warranty, or incur any liability, in connection with the Debt Financing or
the marketing or arrangement thereof (except, in the case of the PEP
Companies, any such representation or warranty that is effective only at or
following the Closing or, solely to the extent necessary to be delivered to
the accountants of the Company in connection with any comfort letters required
hereunder, with respect to the Company Financing Information), (f) no PEP
Company shall be required to prepare or deliver any financial statements or
other financial information or data under this Section 7.14 other than the
Company Financing Information, (g) no member of the board of directors (or
similar governing body) of any PEP Company shall be required to consent to or
approve any written consent, resolution or similar approval in respect of the
Debt Financing or any agreements or instruments entered into in connection
therewith and (h) no personal liability shall be imposed on the officers,
directors, managers, employers or agents involved; provided, further, that
none of the PEP Companies shall be required to bear any cost or expense or pay
any commitment fee or other fee (other than a liability (x) that is contingent
upon the Closing occurring or (y) in respect of which the Purchaser has
agreed to provide reimbursement, including, without limitation, pursuant to
this Section 7.14 or Section 11.2 hereof) with respect to the Debt Financing
prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the
PEP Companies and their respective Representatives and Affiliates from and
against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement or marketing of, or any assistance or cooperation provided in
respect of, or otherwise arising out of, the Debt Financing (including any
action taken pursuant to this Section 7.14(b)) and any information utilized in
connection therewith. Whether or not the Closing Date occurs, Purchaser shall
reimburse Seller, the Company and their respective Affiliates in connection
with the cooperation contemplated by this Section 7.14(b) in accordance with
Section 11.2. All material non-public information provided by the
PEP Companies or any of their representatives pursuant to this Section 7.14
shall be kept confidential, except that Purchaser shall be permitted to
disclose such information to its advisors, the Debt Financing Sources and the
affiliates, employees, representatives, agents and advisors of any Debt
Financing Source and other potential sources of capital, rating agencies and
prospective lenders and investors during syndication of the Debt Financing or
any Alternative Financing subject to the potential sources of capital,
ratings agencies and prospective lenders and investors entering into customary
confidentiality undertakings

 



65  with respect to such information (including through a notice and undertaking
in a form customarily used in confidential information memoranda for senior
credit facilities). The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of the
PEP Companies names, marks and logos in connection with the Debt Financing;
provided that such names, marks and logos are used solely in a manner that is
not intended or not reasonably likely to harm or disparage the PEP Companies.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller and the
Company shall not be deemed in default of, or otherwise in breach of its
obligations under, this Section 7.14, and the condition set forth in Section
8.1(b) as it relates to this Section 7.14(b) shall be deemed satisfied, unless
such breach materially contributed to a failure to obtain the Debt Financing.
Until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article X, the Purchaser shall promptly pay any fees that become
due in connection with the Debt Financing.

7.15  _Termination of Management Consulting Agreement_. The Management
Consulting Agreement shall be terminated at or immediately prior to Closing.

 

7.16 _Earnout Escrow Amount_. The Earnout Escrow Amount will be deposited in
the Escrow Account for the sole purpose of serving as a limited source to pay
earnout obligations of the PEP Companies under the Trigon Agreement with
respect to the periods ending (a) December 31, 2015, (b) April 30, 2016, (c)
April 30, 2017 and/or (d) April 30, 2018. The parties shall promptly execute
and deliver joint instructions to the Escrow Agent to release all or a portion
of the Earnout Escrow Amount for payment pursuant to the Trigon Agreement to
the extent that such amount has been earned pursuant to such Trigon
Agreement. To the extent that funds remain in the Earnout Escrow after the
final scheduled potential earnout payment date pursuant to the Trigon
Agreement, Purchaser and Seller shall promptly execute and deliver joint
instructions to the Escrow Agent to release any remainder in the Earnout
Escrow to Seller. Through the end of the final payment period pursuant to the
earnout under the Trigon Agreement, Purchaser hereby covenants that it will
and will cause the PEP Companies to (i) not amend the earnout terms and
conditions in a manner that is adverse to Seller and (ii) use good faith
efforts to ensure that the PEP Companies do not overpay their earnout
obligation pursuant to the Trigon Agreement and enforce their rights under
the Trigon Agreement. For so long as funds remain in the Earnout Escrow,
Purchaser shall promptly provide Seller with a copy of any financial reporting
information related to the earnout that the PEP Companies are obligated
to provide to the sellers in the Trigon Agreement.

7.17 _280G Issues_. If required to avoid the imposition of Taxes
under Section 4999 of the Code with respect to any payment or benefit in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Seller shall
(a) no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, solicit
from each "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of
the Code) with respect to the PEP Companies who has received or will receive
any payment or benefits that would constitute a "parachute payment" (within
the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code) a waiver of such
disqualified individuals rights to some or all of such payments or benefits
(the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ ") so that all remaining payments and/or
benefits, if any, shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute payments"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) and (b) no later than three
(3) Business Days prior to the Closing 

 



66  Date, with respect to each individual who agrees to the waiver described in
clause (a), submit to a vote of the Class A Unit holders of Seller (along with
adequate disclosure satisfying the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii)
of the Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder) the right of any such
"disqualified individual" to receive or retain the Waived 280G Benefits. No
later than two (2) Business Days prior to soliciting such waivers and
distributing such approval materials, Seller shall provide drafts of such
waivers and approval materials to Purchaser for its reasonable review and
approval (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). If any of the Waived 280G Benefits fail to be approved in accordance
with the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) as contemplated above, such
Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made, provided or retained, as the case may
be. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser evidence
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser that a vote of the Class A Unit holders of
Seller was solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions of
this Section 7.17 and that either (i) the payment of the Waived 280G Benefits
was approved in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(i) (the " _280G
Approval_ ") or (ii) the 280G Approval was not obtained, and, as
a consequence, the Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made, provided or
retained, as the case may be. In connection with the foregoing, Purchaser
shall provide the Seller with all relevant terms of any employment contracts
or other arrangements that will be entered with the "disqualified
individuals" on or prior to the Closing Date that could result in payments and
other terms (including, rights to severances, retention bonuses or signing
bonuses) that need to be approved (or disclosed) to ensure that any such
payments or other terms are included in the Waived 280G Benefits, if
applicable, and the materials soliciting member approval in accordance with
this Section 7.17 are complete and accurate. To the extent such information
provided by Purchaser is incorrect or incomplete in any respect, all Taxes of
the PEP Companies for any Taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date shall be computed for purposes of this Agreement assuming that no payment
made by any of the PEP Companies (including any payments included in the
Transaction Tax Benefits) is nondeductible under Section 280G of the Code, but
only to the extent that the incorrect or incomplete information provided by
Purchaser is the sole cause for a payment being nondeductible under Section
280G.

Standing), Section 4.2 (Authorization of Agreement), Section 4.4
(Capitalization), Section 4.17 (Financial Advisors), and Section 5.1

such time) and in writing by notice from the non-breaching party to the
breaching party before the expiration date of the Survival Period shall not
thereafter be barred by the expiration of the relevant representation or
warranty and such claims shall survive until finally resolved.

 

9.2 _Indemnification by Seller_. Subject to the provisions of this Article IX,
Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, and its Affiliates, and
the respective Representatives, successors and assigns of each of the
foregoing (the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and
all Losses asserted against, incurred, sustained by or imposed against any of
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties (regardless of whether or not such Losses
relate to any Third Party Claim) as a result of, arising out of or relating
to:

 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company or Seller
contained in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto; and

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement by the Company or Seller contained
in this Agreement.

 

9.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to the provisions of this Article
IX, Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and
the respective Representatives, successors and assigns of each of the
foregoing (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and
against any and all Losses asserted against, incurred, sustained by
or imposed against the Seller Indemnified Parties as a result of, arising out
of or relating to:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser contained
in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto; and

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement by Purchaser contained in this
Agreement.

9.4 _Certain Limitations_. The indemnification provided for in Sections
9.2 and 9.3 shall be subject to the following limitations:

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
indemnification claims for Losses shall be asserted by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties under Article IX unless and until: (i) the amount of
Losses in respect of indemnification under Section 9.2(a) (other than with
respect to Losses to the extent arising out of any inaccuracy in or breach of
any Seller Fundamental Representation) arising out of any particular
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the Company or
Seller in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement exceeds $50,000 (the " _Per Claim Threshold_ ") (it being agreed and
understood that all Losses, whether in a single claim or in a group of related
claims, relating to a particular fact, event, circumstance or occurrence (or
a series of related facts, events, circumstances or occurrences, or facts,
events, circumstances or occurrences having the same

 



70  underlying, non-generic factual or legal basis) shall be aggregated for this
purpose), and once the Per Claim Threshold has been exceeded, Seller shall be
required to indemnify, compensate and reimburse the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties for all such Losses from the first dollar, subject to the other
limitations set forth in this Section 9.4(a); and (ii) the aggregate amount of
all Losses in respect of indemnification under Section 9.2 exceeds (except
for breaches of Seller Fundamental Representations, which are not subject to
this limitation) Six Million One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($6,150,000)
(the " _Basket_ "), and the Seller, shall be required to pay or be liable for
all Losses in excess of the Basket. The aggregate amount of all Losses for
which the Seller shall be liable pursuant to Section 9.2 shall not exceed the
Indemnification Escrow Amount. The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to recover Losses in respect of any claim or otherwise obtain
reimbursement or compensation more than once with respect to any
indemnification claim hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification with respect to
any Losses as a result of, or based upon or arising from, any liability to the
extent such liability was included in Closing Working Capital or Company
Indebtedness in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price. Excluding the
Purchasers obligations to pay the full Purchase Price in connection with the
Closing, the Termination Fee and Sellers expenses pursuant to Section 7.14(b)
(which amounts shall not be subject to the following cap), the aggregate
amount of all Losses for which Purchaser shall be liable pursuant to Section
9.3 shall not exceed Six Million Dollars ($6,150,000).

 

(b) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover under
this ARTICLE IX with respect to any Losses (and no such Losses shall be
aggregated for purposes of Section 9.4(a) or otherwise in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby) arising from any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision contained in
this Agreement, or in any exhibit, Schedule or document delivered hereunder,
if the Purchaser had actual knowledge prior to the date hereof of such breach.

 

(c) For purposes of this Article IX, any breach of any representation or
warranty shall be determined without regard to any materiality, Material
Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained in or otherwise
applicable to such representation or warranty; _provided, however_ , that such

incorporates such materiality qualification (e.g. " _Material Contract_ ", "
_Material Customer_ ", " _Material Supplier_ ") and (ii) not apply to (A)
definition of Permitted Liens, (B) Section 4.1(a) and (b) (qualification),
(C) Section 4.3 (Conflicts; Consents of Third Parties), (D) Section 4.5
(Financial Statements), (E) Section 4.6 (No Undisclosed Liabilities), (F)

9.5 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) _Order of Claims_. Losses indemnifiable by the Seller pursuant to Section
9.2 shall first be payable to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties by wire
transfer of

 



71  immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties from the Escrow Fund. Purchaser shall have the
ability to pursue the recovery of Losses in excess of the Escrow Fund from
the Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy in accordance with the procedures and
subject to the limitations set forth therein.

 

(b) _Non-Third Party Claims Process_. The Purchaser Indemnified Party or the
Seller Indemnified Party (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") will deliver a
written notice (a " _Claims Notice_ ") to the other party (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ "), and, to the extent such Claim is covered by the Purchaser RandW
Insurance Policy, to the Purchaser RandW Insurance Provider, promptly upon its
discovery of any matter for which the Indemnifying Party may be liable to the
Indemnified Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim, which
Claims Notice shall (i) describe such claim in reasonable detail and state
the amount or estimated amount of Losses, (ii) state that the Indemnified
Party has paid or properly accrued Losses or anticipates in good faith that it
will incur liability for Losses for which such Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii) if paid or accrued,
state the date such item was paid or accrued, _provided, however,_ that no
delay or failure to give such prompt written notice shall relieve
the Indemnifying Party of any of its indemnification obligations hereunder
except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by
such failure. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist the
Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by
the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance
and cooperation shall include providing reasonable access to and copies of
information, records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing
employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of such
matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such
matters.

 

9.6 _Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving
a Loss or a claim or demand made by any Person not a party to this Agreement
against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified
Party shall deliver a Claims Notice to the Indemnifying Party, as soon
as practicable, describing such claim in reasonable detail and stating the
amount or estimated amount of such Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
delay or failure on the part of an Indemnified Party in notifying the
Indemnifying Party shall relieve an Indemnifying Party from its obligations
hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party is thereby actually prejudiced (and
then solely to the extent of such prejudice).

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Claims Notice, to
assume the defense thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party (and the parties hereby acknowledge that for the purposes
of the foregoing it is stipulated that Locke Lord LLP and Mayer Brown LLP are
satisfactory). If the Indemnifying Party does not expressly elect to assume
the defense of such Third Party Claim within the time period 

 



72  set forth in this Section 9.6(b), the Indemnified Party shall have the sole
right to assume the defense of and to settle such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying
Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim if such settlement,
compromise or judgment (i) involves a finding or admission of wrongdoing; (ii)
does not include an unconditional written release by the claimant or plaintiff
of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim; or (iii) imposes equitable remedies or any obligation on the
Indemnified Party other than solely the payment of money damages for which the
Indemnified Party will be indemnified hereunder. Whether or not the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party
hereunder with respect to any settlement entered into or any judgment
consented to without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent.

9.7 _Escrow_.

 

(a) _Escrow Fund_. To provide a fund against which a Purchaser Indemnified
Party may assert claims of indemnification under this Article IX (each a "
_Purchaser Indemnification Claim_ "), the Escrow Amount shall be deposited
into escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement in accordance with Section
2.2(b). The Escrow Fund shall be held and distributed in accordance with this
Article IX, Section 2.3 and the Escrow Agreement. Each Purchaser
Indemnification Claim shall be made only in accordance with this Article IX,
Section 2.3, and the Escrow Agreement provided that Purchaser shall have the
ability to pursue the recovery of Losses in excess of the Escrow Fund from
the Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy in accordance with the procedures and
subject to the limitations set forth therein. A Purchaser Indemnified Party
shall seek monetary recourse for Purchaser Indemnification Claims solely as
set forth in Section 9.5(a). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, none of the limitations set forth in this Article
IX shall apply to any action for specific performance, injunctive relief, or
other equitable remedy, provided however, that post-Closing, such actions by
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be limited to enforcement of post-Closing
covenants of the Seller.

 

(b) _Reserved Amounts in the Escrow Fund; Release in respect of Claims_. In
the event any Purchaser Indemnification Claim is made by a Purchaser
Indemnified Party pursuant to a Claims Notice delivered to Seller prior to the
Final Escrow Release Date, such Purchaser Indemnified Party and the Seller
shall negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement upon the amount on deposit
in the Indemnification Escrow that should be reserved in respect of such
Claims Notice (a " _Reserved Amount_ "). If such Persons are unable to reach
agreement as to the Reserved Amount by the Final 

 



73  Release Date, then the Reserved Amount with respect to such Claims Notice
shall be the amount in good faith specified by the Purchaser Indemnified Party
in the Claims Notice based on the Purchaser Indemnified Partys reasonable
judgment. Upon the agreement by the Seller and the Purchaser Indemnified Party
or as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in respect of
any Claims Notice, any amounts payable with respect to any Losses in a Claims
Notice to the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be payable in accordance with
Section 9.5(a). Seller and Purchaser shall deliver executed instructions
directing the Escrow Agent to deliver to Purchaser such amount.

(c) _Release from Escrow_.

 

(i) At the expiration of the Survival Period (the " _Final Release Date_ "),
the Seller and the Purchaser shall deliver executed instructions, directing
the Escrow Agent to, subject to the terms set forth in the Escrow Agreement,
disburse to Seller the remaining portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount
which exceeds any Reserved Amounts in respect of Purchaser Indemnification
Claims pending, but not yet paid.

(ii) Following the Final Release Date, from time to time, upon resolution of
any Claims Notice in respect of any Purchaser Indemnification Claim and the
appropriate amount, if any, from the Indemnification Escrow Amount having been
paid to the Purchaser Indemnified Party in respect of such Claims Notice,
the Seller and Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release
to Seller the excess of the then-current balance in the Escrow Fund over the
aggregate Reserved Amounts in respect of all remaining unresolved Purchaser
Indemnification Claims made prior to the Final Release Date, subject to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(iii) Any Claims by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to any
Losses following the expiration of the Final Release Date or the depletion of
the Escrow Fund, may also be made against the Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy
in accordance with the procedures and subject to the limitations set forth
therein.

(d) _No Escrow Offsets._ Purchaser Indemnified Parties may not offset funds
held in or released from (i) the Earnout Escrow against any claims against
any Seller Indemnified Party, including Purchaser Indemnification Claims or an
adjustment pursuant to Section 2.3, (ii) the Adjustment Escrow against any
claims against any Seller Indemnified Party, including Purchaser claims
pursuant to Section 7.16 or Purchaser Indemnification Claims or (c) the
Indemnification Escrow against any claims against any Seller Indemnified
Party, including Purchaser claims pursuant to Section 7.16.

9.8 _Payments_. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally
adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this Article IX, the Indemnifying Party
shall satisfy its obligations within fifteen (15) Business Days of such final,
non-appealable adjudication as set forth in Section 9.5(a) or, if payable to a
Seller Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds.
The parties hereto agree that should an

 



74  Indemnifying Party not make full payment of any such obligations within such
fifteen (15) Business Day period, any amount payable shall accrue interest
from and including the date of agreement of the Indemnifying Party or final,
non-appealable adjudication to and including the date such payment has been
made at a rate per annum equal to 4.0%. Such interest shall be calculated
daily on the basis of a calendar year.

 

9.9 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification payments
made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for all federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by Law, and the parties shall file their Tax Returns
accordingly.

 

9.10 _Calculation of Losses_.

 

(a) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
Article IX shall be net of any amounts (i) actually recovered by any
Indemnified Party under insurance policies or any other source of
indemnification with respect to such Loss including the Alternative
Arrangements, and (ii) accrued on the balance sheet of each of the PEP
Companies as of the Closing Date and taken into account in the calculation of
the Purchase Price with respect to such Loss, and shall be reduced to take
into account any Tax Benefit.

 

(b) In determining the amount of any indemnification payment for a Loss
suffered or incurred by an Indemnified Party hereunder, the amount of such
Loss shall be decreased to take into account any deduction, credit or other
tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party with respect to such
Loss (" _Tax Benefits_ "). In computing the amount of any such Tax Benefit,
the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income,
gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the
incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss; provided, that, if a Tax
Benefit is not realized in or prior to the taxable period during which an
Indemnifying Party makes an indemnification payment or the Indemnified Party
incurs or pays any Loss, the Indemnified Party shall thereafter make payments
to the Indemnifying Party at the end of each subsequent taxable period to
reflect the Tax Benefit realized in each such subsequent taxable period. For
purposes of clarity, a Tax Benefit shall be treated as realized when it is
actually realized or when it is available to be realized through reasonable
best efforts taken by the relevant party.

(c) Each Purchaser Indemnified party shall use reasonable best efforts to make
any claims for insurance, indemnification and/or other amounts available from
third party(ies) with respect to Losses for which it will seek indemnification
hereunder and to diligently pursue such claims in good faith. If any such
insurance proceeds, indemnification and/or other amounts are received or
realized by a Purchaser Indemnified Party after payment by the Seller of any
amount otherwise required to be paid to a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant
to this Article IX, the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall repay to the
Seller, promptly after receiving or realizing such insurance proceeds,
indemnification and/or other amounts, the amount that the Seller would not
have had to pay pursuant to this Article IX had such insurance proceeds,
indemnification and/or other amounts been received or realized by the
Purchaser Indemnified Party prior to the Sellers payment under this Article
IX.

 



75 9.11 _Exclusive Remedies_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
except (a) with respect to any disputes to be resolved under Section 2.3
hereof, (b) for any claim under the terms of the Escrow Agreement, (c) for any
claim of Fraud and (d) claims by Purchaser Indemnified Parties against
the Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy in accordance with the procedures and
subject to the limitations set forth therein, the parties acknowledge and
agree that their sole and exclusive remedy, at Law or in equity, with respect
to any and all claims for any and all breaches of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement made from and after Closing,
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article
IX, (which means, for example, that the survival periods and liability limits
set forth in this Article IX shall control notwithstanding any statutory or
common law provisions or principles to the contrary). In furtherance of the
foregoing, (1) all statutes of limitations or other claims periods with
respect to claims for Losses based on the matters that are subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 9.4 shall be shortened to the
applicable claims periods and survival periods set forth in Section 9.1; and
(2) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties irrevocably waive any and all rights
they may have to make claims against Seller under statutory and common law
with respect to any breach of this Agreement by the Seller or the PEP
Companies. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims, and causes of
action for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement it may have against the other parties hereto and their
Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or
based upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Article IX. Nothing in this Section 9.11 shall limit any
Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any Person
shall be entitled for breach of any Closing or post-Closing covenants
(including Purchasers right to enforce Sellers obligation to deliver the
Shares in connection with the Closing) or to seek any remedy on account of any
partys Fraud. Except for the Seller, no current or former director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, shareholder, agent, attorney or
representative of any of the Sellers, the PEP Companies or their respective
Affiliates, shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of
Seller under this Agreement, the Company Documents or any other agreements
contemplated hereunder or thereunder, or for any claim based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

9.12 _Release_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, each of Purchaser and the PEP Companies
(each a " _Releasor_ "), on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
representatives, successors and assigns, hereby releases, acquits and forever
discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the Seller, and
each of its respective past, present or future officers, managers,
directors, shareholders, partners, members, Affiliates, employees, counsel
and agents (each a " _Releasee_ ") of, from and against any and all actions,
causes of action, claims, demands, damages, judgments, debts, dues and suits
of 

 



76  every kind, nature and description whatsoever (collectively " _Claims_ ")
which such Releasor or its heirs, legal representatives, successors or assigns
ever had, now has or may have on or by reason of any matter, cause or thing
whatsoever, arising out of or relating to any circumstance, agreement,
activity, action, omission, event or matter related to the PEP Companies or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement occurring or existing, in
each case, prior to the date of the Closing whether known or unknown, other
than Claims with respect to (i) any rights or claims of Purchaser under this
Agreement, any Company Document or any Purchaser Document, including with
respect to any breach, non-performance, action or failure to act by Seller or
any PEP Company and (ii) any Fraud committed by any Releasee or any of their
respective Affiliates (collectively, " _Released Claims_ "). Each Releasor
agrees not to, and agrees to cause its respective Affiliates and Subsidiaries
not to, assert any Released Claim against any Releasee.

 

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, legal representatives, successors and assigns, hereby releases,
acquits and forever discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
Purchaser, all PEP Companies and each of their current officers and directors
(the " _Purchaser Related Parties_ ") of, from and against any and all Claims
which Seller, its Affiliates or their heirs, legal representatives, successors
or assigns ever had, now has or may have on or by reason of any matter, cause
or thing whatsoever, arising out of or relating to any circumstance,
agreement, activity, action, omission, event or matter related to the PEP
Companies or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement occurring or
existing, in each case, prior to the date of the Closing whether known or
unknown, other than Claims with respect to (i) any rights or claims of Seller
under this Agreement, any Company Document, or any Purchaser Document,
including with respect to any breach, non-performance, action or failure to
act by Purchaser, (ii) any rights pursuant to or referenced in Section 7.6
(DandO Protections), (iii) PEP Company employee rights to earned but unpaid
compensation and rights under employment agreements, or (iv) Claims with
respect to the commercial relationships of the PEP Companies in the Ordinary
Course of Business (collectively, " _Purchaser Released Claims_ "). Seller
agrees not to, and agrees to cause its respective Affiliates not to, assert
any Purchaser Released Claim against the Purchaser Related Parties. On or
before the date hereof, Seller has delivered to Purchaser releases, in a form
acceptable to Purchaser, executed by at least ninety percent (90%) in interest
of its holders of Class A Units (x) releasing the Purchaser Related Parties
from all Purchaser Related Claims and (y) agreeing not to assert any such
claims against such parties.

(d) by Seller or Purchaser if there shall be in effect a final nonappealable
Order of a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; it being agreed that (i) the parties hereto shall promptly appeal any
adverse determination that is not nonappealable (and pursue such appeal with
reasonable diligence) and (ii) a party may not enforce this Section 10.1(d) to
the extent that such party directly or indirectly assisted in or supported, in
any material way, the process or proceedings giving rise to
such nonappealable Order;

(e) by Purchaser, if there has been a violation or breach by the Company or
Seller of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement which if not cured, would cause a condition to the obligations of
Purchaser at the Closing not to be satisfied, and such violation or breach has
not been waived by Purchaser or cured in all material respects by the Company
or Seller within the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days after receipt by Seller
of written notice thereof from Purchaser or (ii) one (1) Business Day prior to
the End Date; _provided_ that Purchaser shall not have the right to terminate

this Agreement such that any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2(a) or
Section 8.2(b) would not be capable of being satisfied;

_provided_ that the failure to deliver the Estimated Purchase Price at the

_provided further_ , that Seller shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(f) if it is then in breach of
this Agreement such that any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(a) or
Section 8.1(b) would not be capable of being satisfied; or

 

(g) by Seller on or after October 9, 2015 (the " _Company Financing End Date_
"), irrespective of whether or not such date is before, on or after the final
day of the Marketing Period, upon prior written notice to Purchaser if: (i)
Seller has delivered to Purchaser the Company Financing Information on or
before August 24, 2015, _provided that_ , if all of the Company Financing
Information has not been delivered on or before August 24, 2015, the Company
Financing End Date shall be extended by one (1)

 



78  Business Day for each calendar day between August 24, 2015 and the date on
which all of the Company Financing Information is delivered, and _provided
further_ , if all of the Company Financing Information is delivered on August
31, 2015, the Company Financing End Date shall be October 16, 2015; (ii) all
of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 8.1 have been satisfied

the date that Seller has delivered the Company Financing Information and,
based on the date of such delivery and consistent with the methodology set
forth in this paragraph, the date that shall be the Company Financing End
Date.

10.2 _Procedure Upon Termination_. In the event of termination by the
Purchaser or the Seller, or both, pursuant to Section 10.1 hereof, the
terminating party shall forthwith deliver notice thereof to the other party or
parties in accordance with Section 11.6, and this Agreement shall terminate
and become void and of no effect and no party to this Agreement shall have any
further liability or obligation hereunder to any other party hereto (including
for costs and expenses incurred by other parties in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent
provided in Section 7.14(b)), except that the obligations of the parties set
forth in Sections 7.5, 7.7 and 7.14(b), this Section 10.2 and Article XI
hereof shall survive any such termination and shall be enforceable hereunder.
In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Seller pursuant to Section
10.1(f) or (g), then the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller as liquidated
damages and not as a penalty a fee of Thirty Million Seven Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($30,750,000) (the " _Termination Fee_ ") in immediately
available funds within three (3) Business Days after such termination by the
Seller, and the payment by the Purchaser of the Termination Fee shall relieve
the Purchaser from all further liability and obligations under this Agreement.
The Company, the Seller, and the Purchaser each acknowledge that the
agreements contained in this Section 10.2 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the Company, the Seller, and the Purchaser would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Purchaser fails to timely pay the
Termination Fee when due and, in order to obtain such payment, the Seller
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Purchaser for the
payment of such Termination Fee, the Purchaser shall pay the Seller its and
the Companys costs and expenses incurred in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount of the unpaid Termination Fee at the
prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made to (but excluding) the date such payment
was actually received. Without limiting the generality of Section 11.9 hereof,
in the event that Purchaser is required to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to
this Section 10.2 and Purchaser timely pays the full Termination Fee, payment
of such fee shall be the sole and exclusive

 



79  remedy of Seller, the Company and their Affiliates against Purchaser (other
than in connection with the enforcement of the Confidentiality Agreement and
reimbursement of expenses of Seller and the PEP Companies pursuant to Section
7.14(b)), the Financing Sources, the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties
and any of their respective former, current and future Affiliates,
representatives, shareholders, members, managers, partners, successors and
assigns for any Losses suffered or incurred as a result of or under this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
failure of the Closing to occur and Seller and the Company shall not bring or
permit any of their respective Affiliates to bring any action, suit or other
proceeding in connection with any such failure of the Closing to occur.

with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other agreement,
document and instrument contemplated hereby and the consummation of the

incurring such expenses, except as otherwise provided by this Agreement
provided, however, Purchaser shall promptly, upon request by Seller or the
Company, reimburse Seller or the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket

and other information requested or required to by produced in furtherance of
the Debt Financing).

11.3 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process; Waiver of
Jury Trial_.

(a) Subject to Section 11.5(b), the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit
to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court located within the
State of Delaware over any dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and each party
hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute or any
suit, action or proceeding related thereto may be heard and determined in such
courts. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such court or any defense of
inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

 



80 (b) Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being served by any
party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by delivery of a
copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6.

(c) TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED,
EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS
PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN
RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING IN
WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED TO, BASED ON OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER
ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE. ANY PARTY
HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 11.3 WITH
ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER
OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

11.4 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement (including the
Schedules and any exhibits hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement
represent the entire understanding and agreement between the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement can be amended,
supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by
written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed by
Purchaser and Seller; provided, however, that none of Sections 3.1, 7.14,
10.2, 11.4, 11.5, 11.8, 11.9 and 11.10 (and any provision of this Agreement to
the extent an amendment, modification, waiver, supplement or termination of
such provision would modify the substance of any of such Sections) may be
amended in any manner that is adverse to the Committed Lenders or the Debt
Financing Sources Related Parties without the written consent of the
Committed Lenders. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including
without limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be
deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of
compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this
Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver
of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure
on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy.

11.5  _Governing Law_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the

jurisdiction.

 



81 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any
Person in any action, suit or proceeding of any kind or description, whether
in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any

any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to

contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal and New York state
courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York, (ii)

all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise) against any of the Debt Financing Sources or Debt Financing
Sources Related Parties in any way relating to the Debt Commitment Letter
or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be
exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws
of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or rules or
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction and (iii) hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation (whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) directly or indirectly arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance
thereof or the financings contemplated thereby. The Debt Financing Sources
and Debt Financing Sources Related Parties are intended third party
beneficiaries of this Section 11.5(b).

11.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

11.8 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to
create any third party beneficiary rights in any person or entity not a party
to this Agreement except (a) as contemplated by Sections 7.6, 9.2, 9.3, 11.9,
11.11 and 11.12 and (b) the Debt Financing Sources and Debt Financing Sources
Related Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce,
this _Section 11.8_ and _Sections 11.4_ , _11.5_ , _11.9_ and  _11.10_. No
assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be
made by the Seller, the Company or Purchaser, directly or indirectly (by
operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto and any attempted assignment without the required
consents shall be void; _provided, however_ that, after the Closing, (i)
Purchaser may assign all of its rights to payment under this Agreement for
Collateral security purposes to any lender providing financing to Purchaser
pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter, but no such assignment shall relieve
Purchaser of any liability or obligation hereunder and (ii) Seller may assign
all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to a liquidating trust
or similar entity in connection with the liquidation of Seller. No assignment
of any obligations hereunder shall relieve the parties hereto of any such
obligations. Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in this
Agreement to Purchaser shall also apply to any such assignee unless the
context otherwise requires.

11.9 _No Recourse or Personal Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, and except, from and after the Closing, pursuant to the terms
of the Escrow Agreement, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claims or causes of action for breach of this Agreement may only be made
against the Persons that are expressly identified as parties hereto and no
other Person (including, without limitation, any Debt Financing Source and any
Debt Financing Sources Related Party) shall have any liability for any
obligations or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement for any claim
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) for breach of this Agreement or in

 



84  respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith and, subject to the rights of Purchaser and its applicable Affiliates
under the Debt Commitment Letter, the parties hereto and their former,
current and future Affiliates, partners, directors, officers, employees,
agents, trustees, administrators, managers, advisors and representatives,
shareholders, members, successors and assigns, shall not have any rights or
claims against, and agree not to commence (and if commenced agree to dismiss
or otherwise terminate) any action or proceeding, whether at law or in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise, against any Debt Financing Source or
Debt Financing Sources Related Party in connection with this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby or the Debt Financing (including any dispute
arising out of, or relating in any way to, the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof) and neither the Company, Seller nor any of their former,
current or future Affiliates, partners, directors, officers, employees,
agents, trustees, administrators, managers, advisors and representatives,
shareholders, members, successors and assigns shall be entitled to seek
specific performance of any rights of Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof to
cause the Debt Financing to be funded.

 

11.10 _Remedies_. Subject in all respects to Sections 9.11, 10.2, and 11.9 and
except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies provided
herein will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that one of the parties hereto does not perform its obligations
under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise breaches such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance
and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each
case without posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly available
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other parties
have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. 

11.11 _Retention of Advisors_. In any dispute or proceeding arising under or
in connection with this Agreement following the Closing, Seller and its
owners shall have the right, at their election, to retain Adler Pollock and
Sheehan P.C., Alvarez and Marsal, Locke Lord LLP and/or Mayer Brown LLP to
represent them in such matter, even if such representation shall be adverse
to Purchaser and/or the PEP Companies. Purchaser and the PEP Companies, for
themselves and for their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, hereby
irrevocably consent to any such representation in any such matter.
Purchaser and the PEP Companies, for themselves and for their respective
Affiliates, successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably waive any actual or
potential conflict arising from any such representation in the event of: (1)
any adversity between the interests of

 



85  Seller and its owners on the one hand and Purchaser and the PEP Companies on
the other hand, in any such matter; (2) any communication between Adler
Pollock and Sheehan P.C., Locke Lord LLP and/or Mayer Brown LLP and any PEP
Company, its Affiliates or employees, whether privileged or not, or any other
information known to such counsel, by reason of such counsels representation
of any of the PEP Companies prior to Closing; and/or (3) any communication
between Alvarez and Marsal and any PEP Company, its Affiliates or employees,
whether privileged or not, or any other information known to such advisor, by
reason of such advisors representation of any of the PEP Companies prior to
Closing.

11.12 _Protected Communication_. The parties to this Agreement agree that,
immediately prior to the Closing, without the need for any further action (a)
all right, title and interest of any PEP Company in and to all Protected
Communications shall thereupon transfer to and be vested solely in Seller and
its successors in interest, and (b) any and all protections from disclosure,
including, but not limited to, attorney client privileges and work product
protections, associated with or arising from any Protected Communications that
would have been exercisable by any PEP Company shall thereupon be vested
exclusively in Seller and its successors in interest and shall be exercised or
waived solely as directed by Seller or its successors in interest. None of the
PEP Companies, Purchaser or any Person acting on any of their behalf shall,
without the prior written consent of Seller or its successors in interest,
assert or waive or attempt to assert or waive any such protection against
disclosure, including, but not limited to, the attorney-client privilege or
work product protection, or to discover, obtain, use or disclose or attempt
to discover, obtain, use or disclose any Protected Communications in any
manner, including in connection with any dispute or legal proceeding relating
to or in connection with this Agreement, the events and negotiations leading
to this Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated herein, _provided,
however_ , the foregoing shall neither prohibit Purchaser from seeking proper
discovery of such documents nor Seller from asserting that such documents are
not discoverable to the extent that applicable attorney client privileges and
work product protections have attached thereto. Seller and its successors in
interest shall have the right at any time prior to or following the Closing
to remove, erase, delete, disable, copy or otherwise deal with any Protected
Communications in whatever way they desire, and the Companies and Purchaser
shall provide full access to all Protected Communications in their possession
or within their direct or indirect control and shall provide reasonable
assistance at the expense of the Person requesting such assistance in order to
give full force and effect to the rights of Seller and its successors in
interest hereunder.

11.13 _No Waiver of Privilege, Protection from Disclosure or Use_. The parties
hereto understand and agree that nothing in this Agreement, including the
foregoing provisions regarding the assertions of protection from disclosure
and use, privilege and conflicts of interest, shall be deemed to be a waiver
of any applicable attorney-client privilege or other protection from
disclosure or use. Each of the parties understands and agrees that it has
undertaken reasonable efforts to prevent the disclosure of Protected
Communications. Notwithstanding those efforts, the parties understand and
agree that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement could result in the inadvertent disclosure of information that may
be confidential, eligible to be subject to a

 



86  claim of privilege, or otherwise protected from disclosure. The parties
further understand and agree that any disclosure of information that may be
confidential, subject to a claim of privilege, or otherwise protected from
disclosure will not constitute a waiver of or otherwise prejudice any claim of
confidentiality, privilege, or protection from disclosure, including, but not
limited to, with respect to information involving or concerning the same
subject matter as the disclosed information. The parties agree to use
reasonable best efforts to return any inadvertently disclosed information to
the disclosing party promptly upon becoming aware of its existence. The
parties further agree that promptly after the return of any inadvertently
disclosed information, the party returning such information shall destroy any
and all copies, summaries, descriptions and/or notes of such inadvertently
disclosed information, including electronic versions thereof, and all
portions of larger documents or communications that contain such copies,
summaries, descriptions or notes.

 

11.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, including by facsimile or PDF file, each of which will be
deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken
together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.

 

11.15 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth
or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.
