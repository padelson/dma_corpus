Sheet_ "), certified by the Purchaser as fairly presenting the financial

### 

  

### (b) _Calculation of Cash Purchase Price_.  Simultaneously with the

#### (i) During the 30 calendar day period following the Companys receipt of

Sheet, the Purchase Price Statement and/or the determination of Company Debt
Amount and Net Current Assets and the Cash Purchase Price set forth thereon;
provided, however, that the Company must notify the Purchaser in writing of
each disputed item, specifying the amount thereof in dispute and setting
forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute, within 30 calendar
days of the Purchasers delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and the

### (d) _Resolution of Disputes Under This Section 3.03_. In the event that
written notice of a dispute is received by the Purchaser under Section
3.03(c) in a timely manner, the Purchaser and the Company shall attempt in
good faith to resolve their dispute for a period of 15 calendar days. In the
event that the Purchaser and the Company are unable to resolve such dispute
within such period, the Purchasers Accountants and the Companys Accountants
will attempt to reconcile their differences, and any resolution by them as to
any disputed amounts will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties
hereto. If the Purchasers Accountants and the Companys Accountants are
unable to reach a resolution with such effect within 30 calendar days after
receipt of such written notice of dispute under Section 3.03(c), the
Purchasers Accountants and the Companys Accountants will submit the items
(together with their respective positions thereon and reasons therefor)
remaining in dispute for resolution to the Independent Accounting Firm.
The Independent Accounting Firm will be instructed to determine the
appropriate amount of each disputed item in accordance with GAAP and render a
report to the Purchaser and the Company within 20 calendar days after such
submission; provided, however, that in no case may such determination of any
such disputed item be outside the range established by the respective
positions of the Purchasers Accountants and the Companys Accountants.  The
report of the Independent Accounting Firm as to the disputed items will be
conclusive as to each disputed item and will be final and binding on the
parties hereto. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm for
such determination shall be paid by the parties based upon the degree to
which the Independent Accounting Firm accept the respective positions of the
parties. For example, if it is Purchasers position that the adjustment owed
is $300, the Companys position that the adjustment owed is $100 and the
Independent Accounting Firms finding that the adjustment owed is $150, then
Purchaser shall pay 75% (300-150 / 300-100) of the Independent Accounting
Firms fees and expenses and the Company shall pay 25% (150-100 / 300-100) of
the Independent Accounting Firms fees and expenses. Other than the expense
of retaining the Independent Accounting Firm, the expense of preparing the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Purchase Price Statement shall be borne by the
Purchaser and the expense of the Companys review shall be borne by
the Company and the Shareholders.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Adjustment of Cash Purchase Price and Payment of Adjustment Amount_.
In the event that the Cash Purchase Price set forth in the Purchase Price
Statement (as finally determined in accordance with this Article III) is (i)
less than the Estimated Cash Purchase Price, the Purchaser shall have the
right to withdraw an amount in cash equal to the shortfall from the Escrow
Amount pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.07 hereof, and if the amount
of such shortfall exceeds the Escrow Amount, then the Company and the
Shareholders, jointly and severally agree promptly to pay to the Purchaser
the amount of such excess, in cash in immediately available funds, and (ii)
greater than the Estimated Cash Purchase Price, the Company shall have the
right to withdraw an amount in cash equal to the amount of such excess from
the Escrow Amount, and if the amount of such excess exceeds the Escrow
Amount, then the Purchaser agrees promptly to pay to the Company the amount
of such excess, in cash in immediately available funds; provided, however,
that in no event shall the Cash Purchase Price exceed the Cash Amount, and in
no event shall the sum of (aa) the amount of such withdrawal by the Company
from the Escrow Amount, plus (bb) Purchasers payment of any such excess set

Amount, exceed an amount equal to the Cash Amount minus the Company Debt
Amount.

  

### 

  

## Section 3.04. _Allocation of Purchase Price for Tax Purposes_. On or
before the Closing Date, the Company and the Purchaser will agree upon an
allocation of the Purchase Price covering the Purchased Assets for federal,
state and local Tax purposes. Upon reaching such agreement, such allocation
will be set forth on _Schedule 3.04_ hereto. The Company and its Subsidiaries
and the Purchaser will implement, report and accept the allocation set forth
on _Schedule 3.04_ for federal, state and local Tax purposes.  The parties
agree that such allocations will not in any way limit their respective rights
and obligations under the Sale Documents in respect of representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements and the breach thereof or damages
therefor.

that could reasonably be expected to result in the disqualification of any
Benefit Plan under applicable Law, or the imposition of penalties or excise
Taxes with respect to any Benefit Plan by the Internal Revenue Service, the
U.S. Department of Labor, the PBGC or any other Governmental Body. Other than
claims for benefits under the claims procedures of any Benefit Plans, there
are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing,

this Agreement.  All contributions required to be made, and claims to be
paid, under the terms of any Benefit Plan maintained or contributed by the
Company or any Subsidiary have been timely made or reserves therefor on the
balance sheet of the Company have been established, which reserves are
adequate in all material respects. None of the Parents or Companys purpose

without limitation, the Purchaser Note.

#### (iii) During the Extended Term and for a period of six months
thereafter, upon reasonable notice to the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall
permit the Company and its representatives reasonable access to the
Purchasers books and records relating to the Non-Compete Payments and the
Maintenance Fee Agreement, for the purpose of confirming the Purchasers
calculations of the Non-Compete Payments hereunder.

  

#### 

  

### (f) _Enforcement_. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Sale
Documents, if, at the time of enforcement of any provision of this Section, a
court should hold that the duration or scope restrictions stated herein are
unreasonable or unenforceable under circumstances then existing, the parties
agree that the maximum duration or scope permitted by applicable Law under
such circumstances will be substituted for the stated duration or scope.

## Section 11.02. _Notice and Opportunity to Defend_.

### (a) _Delivery of Indemnification Notice_. (i) if there occurs an event
which a party hereto asserts is an indemnifiable event pursuant to Section
11.01 hereof, the party seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnitee_ ") will
promptly notify the party obligated to provide indemnification hereunder (the
" _Indemnitor_ ") in writing (such written notice being an " _Indemnification
Notice_ "). Such Indemnification Notice shall specify (A) the nature of the
claim or Loss, (B) the facts, circumstances, issues and events with respect
to such claim or Loss in reasonable detail, and (C) the amount of such claim
or Loss, if determined.  Delay or failure to deliver an Indemnification
Notice to the Indemnitor will only relieve the Indemnitor of its
indemnification obligations hereunder to the extent, if at all, that the
Indemnitor is actually prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure.

  

### 

  

#### (ii) The Indemnitor will have a period of 10 calendar days following the
Indemnitors receipt of the Indemnification Notice (such period to be 20
calendar days if the event specified in the Indemnification Notice involves a
claim or a Loss by a Person other than a Purchaser Indemnified Person or a
Company Indemnified Person (a " _Third Party Claim_ ")), in which to either
(A) accept responsibility for such claim, Loss or Third Party Claim or (B)
deny or dispute responsibility for such claim, Loss or Third Party

  



  

72      
   



  

#### Claim (which dispute may be as to the validity of such claim or Loss,
the amount thereof or both).

  



  

### (b) _Third Party Claims_. (i)  Subject to the provisions of clause
(iii)(B) below, if the Indemnitor accepts responsibility for a Third Party
Claim in writing within such 20 calendar day period, the Indemnitor will be
obligated to defend, compromise or settle such Third Party Claim and, subject
to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this Article, the
Indemnitor will be liable for the Losses in connection with such Third Party
Claim, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of counsel
incurred by the Indemnitor in defending, compromising or settling such Third
Party Claim; provided, however, that in such an event, the Indemnitee will
have the right to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and
employ counsel, at the Indemnitees expense, separate from the counsel
employed by the Indemnitor, it being understood that the Indemnitor will
control such defense.

  

### 

  

#### (ii) If (A) the Indemnitor fails to accept responsibility for such Third
Party Claim within such 20 calendar day period or the Indemnitor does not
respond within such 20 calendar day period, or (B) either (x) the Indemnitee
is advised by counsel that in connection with such Third Party Claim there
may be one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnitee that are not
available to the Indemnitor or conflict with or are different from those
available to the Indemnitor, (y) the Third Party Claim seeks an order,
injunction or other relief other than money damages against the Indemnitee,
or (z) the Indemnitor does not promptly provide the Indemnitee with its
financial statements or other information demonstrating the Indemnitors
ability to discharge its obligations under this Article XI in full, then in
any such case, the Indemnitor will not be entitled to assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim and the Indemnitee shall have the right to undertake
the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim and, subject
to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this Article, the
Indemnitor will be liable for the Losses in connection with such Third Party
Claim, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of counsel
incurred by the Indemnitee in defending, compromising or settling such Third
Party Claim; provided, however, that in such an event, the Indemnitor will
have the right to participate in the defense of such matter and employ
counsel, at the Indemnitors expense (provided, that such expenses shall not
count towards any limitations on the Indemnitors obligations hereunder),
separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitee, it being understood
that the Indemnitee will control such defense.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) The Indemnitor will not be liable for any settlement of any Action
effected without the Indemnitors written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), but if settled with the Indemnitors
written consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such
Action, the Indemnitor agrees, subject to the terms, conditions and
limitations set forth in this Article, to indemnify and hold harmless the
Indemnitee from and against any Loss by reason of such settlement or
judgment.

  

#### 

  

### (c) _Non-Third Party Claims_. (i) If the Indemnitor accepts
responsibility for a claim or Loss which does not involve a Third Party Claim
in writing within such 10 calendar day period, or the Indemnitor does not
respond within such 10 calendar day period, such claim or Loss specified by
the Indemnitee in the Indemnification Notice will conclusively be deemed a

  



  

73      
   



  

liability of the Indemnitor under Section 11.01 and the Indemnitor will pay
the amount of such liability to the Indemnitee on demand.

  



  

#### (ii) If the Indemnitor has timely disputed its liability with respect to
such claim or Loss within such 10 calendar day period, the Indemnitor and the
Indemnitee will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such
dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute will be
resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction.

  

#### 

  

### (d) _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in this Article
XI is prohibited under applicable Laws to an Indemnitee (other than by reason
of the exceptions, limitations and conditions set forth in this Article) then
the Indemnitor, in lieu of indemnifying the Indemnitee, will contribute to
the amount paid or payable by the Indemnitee as a result of the Losses in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
Indemnitor, on the one hand, and of the Indemnitee, on the other,
in connection with the events or circumstances which resulted in the Losses
as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
the Indemnitor, on the one hand, and of the Indemnitee, on the other, will be
determined by reference to, among other things, such Persons relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
prevent the events or circumstances resulting in the Losses.

  



  

## Section 11.03. _Survival of Indemnification_. The representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties contained in the Sale
Documents or in any document delivered pursuant thereto and the rights to
indemnification under this Agreement with respect thereto will survive the
Closing Date and any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of the
Purchaser or any other party; provided, however, that the representations and
warranties set forth in the Sale Documents and the indemnification under
Section 11.01(a) and (b) shall expire on the second anniversary of the
Closing Date, unless prior to such date, an Indemnification Notice or other
notice of the inaccuracy or breach thereof has been given; provided, however,
that:

  



  

### (a) _Fundamental Indemnification_. The (i) Fundamental Representations
and the Fundamental Representation Indemnification and (ii) the rights to
indemnification under Section 11.01(a)(ii), (v), (vi) and (vii), will survive
the Closing for a period ending on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date,
and will be effective with respect to any inaccuracy therein, breach thereof
or claims made thereunder, notice of which has been given within such period;
and

  



  

### (b) _Tax Indemnification_. The representations and warranties set
forth in Section 5.08, the covenants and agreements set forth in Section
10.03(b), and the Tax Indemnification will survive the Closing for a period
ending six months after the termination of the statute of limitations (or any
extension thereof) on any Law applicable to the matters covered therein, and
will be effective with respect to any inaccuracy therein, breach thereof or
claims made thereunder, notice of which has been given within such period.

  



  

## Section 11.04. _Threshold; Limitation on Liability; Release of Company_.

  



  

### (a) _Threshold_. No Purchaser Indemnified Person or Company Indemnified
Person will be entitled to indemnification for any Losses under Section
11.01(a)(i) or 11.01(b)(i), unless

  



  

74      
   



  

and until the aggregate amount of Losses suffered, sustained, or incurred by
all of the Purchaser Indemnified Persons or the Company Indemnified Persons,
as the case may be, due to the inaccuracy or breach of any representations or
warranties or in any certificate delivered thereunder, exceeds the Threshold
Amount, calculated on a cumulative basis and not per item basis , and then
such party will be entitled to recover such Losses from the first dollar of
such Losses and not merely the excess of such Losses above the Threshold
Amount; provided, however, that with respect to indemnification pursuant to
the Fundamental Representation Indemnification, the Tax Indemnification and
indemnification under Section 11.01(a)(ii), (v), (vi) and (vii), the
Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to recover any such Losses
from the first dollar of such Losses without any threshold, basket or
deductible of any kind, and any such payments shall count towards
the Threshold Amount.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Limitations on Liability of the Shareholders and the Company_. The
aggregate liability of the Shareholders and the Company for indemnification
under Section 11.01(a) of this Agreement shall not exceed an aggregate amount
equal to the Cash Proceeds.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Limitations on Liability of the Purchaser_. The aggregate liability
of the Purchaser for indemnification under Section 11.01(b) of this Agreement
shall not exceed an aggregate amount equal to 10% of the Cash Proceeds.

Agreement to the contrary, except for the provisions of Section 11.05 below
which shall apply to this Section 11.04(d), effective from and after the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Company shall have no further
obligation to indemnify the Purchaser under this Article XI, except with
respect to any Losses or claims made for which the Purchaser or any Purchaser
Indemnified Person shall have given the Company notice on or prior to such
first anniversary; provided, however, that such release of the Company shall
not in any way eliminate, restrict, affect or impair the Purchasers and the
Purchaser Indemnified Persons rights to (i) be indemnified by the
Shareholders under this Article XI for Losses related to inaccuracies or
breaches of representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Company set forth in the Sale Documents to the extent and during the period
that the Company or the Shareholders were obligated to indemnify the
Purchaser or the Purchaser Indemnified Persons, (ii) be indemnified for each
type of Claim by the Shareholders under this Article XI during the relevant
entire periods for each type of Claim provided in Section 11.03 above, and
(iii) claim against and withdraw amounts from the Escrow Amount as provided
in Section 11.07(d) below.

  

### 

  

## Section 11.05. _Fraud Exception_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Purchaser Indemnified Persons_. Notwithstanding any provision
contained in Article XI to the contrary, in the event any Loss or failure to
discover a fact or condition by a Purchaser Indemnified Person, is due to,
arises from, or is in connection with, fraud, intentional misrepresentation,
grossly negligent misrepresentation or willful misconduct by any Shareholder,
the Company, any of their Subsidiaries or any Person acting or purporting to
act on their behalf, such Purchaser Indemnified Person will be entitled to
recover any such Losses from the Shareholders and the Company, jointly and
severally, without regard to any of the time limitations, dollar thresholds
or dollar limitations set forth above, and will be entitled to recover

  



  

75      
   



  

the full amount of such Losses from the first dollar of any such Loss,
together with any punitive, exemplary and other damages that may be assessed
by any court of competent jurisdiction.

  



  

### (b) _Company Indemnified Persons_. Notwithstanding any provision
contained in Article XI to the contrary, in the event any Loss or failure to
discover a fact or condition by a Company Indemnified Person, is due to,
arises from, or is in connection with, fraud, intentional misrepresentation,
grossly negligent misrepresentation or willful misconduct by the Purchaser,
any of its Subsidiaries or any Person acting or purporting to act on their
behalf, such Company Indemnified Person will be entitled to recover any such
Losses from the Purchaser without regard to any of the time limitations,
dollar thresholds or dollar limitations set forth above, and will be entitled
to recover the full amount of such Losses from the first dollar of any such
Loss, together with any punitive, exemplary and other damages that may be
assessed by any court of competent jurisdiction.

  

### 

  

## Section 11.06. _Set-Off_. Each of the parties hereto
expressly acknowledges and agrees that in the event that a Purchaser
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification under Section 11.01(a), the
Purchaser will be entitled to set-off the amount of such Losses incurred by
such Purchaser Indemnified Person against and retain such amount from any
obligations or payments due to any Shareholder or the Company under any Sale
Document, including, without limitation, under the Purchaser Note.

  

## 

  

## Section 11.07. _Escrow_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Escrow Agreement_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser,
the Shareholders and the Company will enter into the Escrow Agreement with
the Escrow Agent.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Escrow Deposit_. In order to secure the obligations of
the Shareholders and the Company to (i) pay to the Purchaser any amount
under Section 3.03(e) hereof, and (ii) indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons under Section 11.01(a) hereof, on the Closing Date, the
Purchaser will deposit the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent, to be held by
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.  Such Escrow
Amount will be deposited into an account to be managed and paid out by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Escrow Amount_. (i)  The term " _Escrow Amount_ " means an amount in
cash equal to the sum of (A) $7,500,000.00 (the " _General Escrow Amount_ "),
plus (B) the Specified Liability Escrow Amount (as defined below).

  

### 

  

#### (ii) The " _Specified Liability Escrow Amount_ " means (i) as of the
date of this Agreement, an amount equal to the sum of all of the Liabilities
set forth on _Schedule 11.07(c)_ hereof, which the parties agree is
$19,024,000.00 (such amount being the " _Specified Liability Amount_ "), and
(ii) as of the Closing Date, an amount equal to (A) the Specified Liability
Amount, minus (B) the Pre-Closing Extinguished Liability Amount (as defined
below).

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) The " _Pre-Closing Extinguished Liability Amount_ " means, with
respect to all of the Liabilities set forth on _Schedule 11.07(c)_ for which
the Company shall have received (and delivered to the Purchaser) a full,
unconditional and irrevocable release of

  



  

76      
   



  

#### the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Purchaser and their
respective successors and assigns in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser prior to the Closing Date (each such Liability
being an " _Extinguished Liability_ "), the aggregate amount of such
Extinguished Liabilities as set forth on _Schedule 11.07(c)_; provided,
however, that in no event shall the Pre-Closing Extinguished Liability Amount
exceed the Specified Liability Escrow Amount.

  



  

### (d) _Right to Withdraw_. In the event that either (i) (A) the Purchaser
is entitled to any amount under Section 3.03(e) hereof, or (ii) a Purchaser
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
11.01(a), then the Purchaser, or such Purchaser Indemnified Person, as the
case may be, will have the right to withdraw such amounts from the balance of
the Escrow Amount pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, or (ii) the Company is
entitled to any amount under Section 3.03(e) hereof, then the Company will
have the right to withdraw such amount from the balance of the Escrow Amount
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. In such an event, the Purchaser or the
Company, as the case may be, will instruct the Escrow Agent in writing
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement to pay the Purchaser, such
Purchaser Indemnified Person or the Company, as the case may be, from the
Escrow Amount the amount that is due the Purchaser, such Purchaser
Indemnified Person or the Company, as the case may be.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Release of Escrow_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) _Post-Closing Extinguished Liabilities_. After the Closing Date, in
the event that the Company shall receive (and deliver to the Purchaser) a
full, unconditional and irrevocable release of the Company, its Subsidiaries,
the Purchaser and their respective successors and assigns in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser in respect of
an Extinguished Liability (except for Liabilities that are included within
the definition of Pre-Closing Extinguished Liability Amount), then (A) the
Escrow Amount shall be reduced by the amount of such Extinguished Liability
as set forth on _Schedule 11.07(c)_, and (B) the Escrow Agent will pay
to the Company from the Escrow Amount, an aggregate amount equal to the
amount of such Extinguished Liability as set forth on _Schedule 11.07(c)_
(the sum of all such amounts being the " _Post-Closing Extinguished
Liability Amount_ "); provided, however, that in no event shall the sum of
the Pre-Closing Extinguished Liability Amount, plus the Post-Closing
Extinguished Liability Amount exceed the Specified Liability Escrow Amount,
and provided, further, however, that in no event shall the Escrow Amount held
by the Escrow Agent be reduced below the General Escrow Amount, except to the
extent funds in the Escrow Account have theretofore been used to satisfy
Losses or claims under Section 11.01(a).

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) _Second Anniversary_. On the second anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Escrow Agent will pay to the Company an aggregate amount
equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount held by the Escrow Agent in
the escrow account on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, over (ii)
the aggregate dollar amount of all claims made (but not paid as of the second
anniversary of the Closing Date) by the Purchaser or the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons under Section 3.03(c) or Section 11.01(a); provided,
however, that such payment or release shall not limit or affect the rights of
the Purchaser or any other Purchaser Indemnified Persons under this Article
XI or otherwise.

79      
   



  

other remedy to which the Company and the Shareholders are or may be entitled
