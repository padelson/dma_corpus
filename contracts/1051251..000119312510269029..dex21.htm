best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable,
to enter into this Agreement, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger and (iii) resolved to
recommend adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have approved
this Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger Sub,
respectively to enter into this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as an
inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, MD and each
of his related parties that is a Rollover Investor is entering into the
Rollover Letter, pursuant to which MD and each of the Rollover Investors will

and inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement,
each of TPG Partners VI, L.P., Green Equity Investors V, L.P. and Green Equity

_Guarantors_ ") is entering into a limited guaranty in favor of the Company
(the " _Guaranty_ ") with respect to certain obligations of Parent and Merger
Sub under this Agreement;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE I

_The Merger_

SECTION 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

SECTION 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time), on a date to be specified by
Parent and the Company (the " _Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than
the third business day after satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), at
the offices of Ropes and Gray LLP, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New
York 10036, unless another date, time, or place is agreed to in writing by
Parent and the Company; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof, if the Marketing
Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions at such time), the Closing shall occur instead on (a) the
date following the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions that is the
earliest to occur of (i) any business day during the Marketing Period
specified by Parent to the Company on no less than three business days
written notice to the Company and (ii) the next business day after the final
day of the Marketing Period, but subject, in each case, to the satisfaction or
waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth
in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions at such time) at such time or (b) such other date, time, or place
as agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. 

SECTION 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger, executed
in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). At or prior to
consummation of the Merger, the parties shall make all other filings,
recordings or publications required under the DGCL in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate
of Merger in accordance with the DGCL, or at such later time as is agreed to
by the parties hereto prior to the Closing Date and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is
herein referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



2 SECTION 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and by-
laws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be in the form of
(except with respect to the name of the Company) the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of Merger Sub, and as so amended shall be
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (and subject to
Section 5.9 hereof).

SECTION 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. 

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and
by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

ARTICLE II

 

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; Exchange of Certificates; Company_

 

 _Stock Options_

SECTION 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of Merger
Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



3 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Treatment
of Stock Held by Company Subsidiaries_. All shares of Company Common Stock
that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of Company
Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor. For the avoidance of doubt, all shares of
Company Common Stock (including Restricted Shares, if any) contributed to
Parent by the Rollover Investors (collectively, the " _Rollover Shares_ ")
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration. Any shares of Company Common Stock owned
by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company shall not
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration and shall, at the
election of Parent, either (i) convert into shares of a class of stock of the
Surviving Corporation designated by Parent in connection with the Merger or
(ii) be canceled.

(c)  _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share
of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b), Rollover Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to $43.50, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_
"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate, which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ "), shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration
therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(b),
without interest.

 

SECTION 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration, in each case in
accordance with this Article II and, in connection therewith, shall prior to
the Closing Date enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent an amount
in cash sufficient to pay such aggregate Merger Consideration. Such aggregate
cash deposited with the Paying Agent shall, pending its disbursement to such
holders, be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent in (i) short-
term direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-term

 



4  obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii)
short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Services or (iv)
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion. Parent shall promptly
replace or cause to be replaced any funds deposited with the Paying Agent lost
through any investment made pursuant to this Section 2.2(a). Nothing contained
in this Section 2.2(a) and no investment losses resulting from investment of
the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any
holder of Company Common Stock (including Restricted Shares that are treated
as Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.4) to receive the Merger
Consideration or any holder of an Option to receive the Designated
Consideration, in each case as provided herein.

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than three business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common
Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such
form and shall have such other customary provisions as Parent and the Company
may reasonably agree prior to the Closing Date) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration, without interest, for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have
paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate surrendered and shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated
by this Article II, without interest.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all 

 



5  rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificates, and at the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.
Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.2(e), if, at any time after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this Article II.

(e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by
such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest
thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
property of Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 



6 (g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts any of them
reasonably determines are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_
"), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Government
Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 

SECTION 2.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder
who has properly exercised and perfected its, his or her appraisal rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") shall not
be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such holder shall be
entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such
Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (or any successor
provision) (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any
Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right, such holders shares of Company Common Stock
shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become
exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with
Section 2.1, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to control all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands for appraisal.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time
the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 

SECTION 2.4 _Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock_.

 

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary (including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or
resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof
and amending any Company Stock Plan) to:

(i) terminate each Company Stock Plan;

 



7 (ii) except as otherwise agreed by Parent and a holder thereof, provide that
each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted
under a Company Stock Plan or otherwise but excluding any options granted
pursuant to the ESPP (each, an " _Option_ ") that is outstanding and
unexercised (without regard to the exercise price of such Option) as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall (A)
become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to and contingent on the
Closing and (B) be cancelled as of the Effective Time (in each case, without
the creation of additional liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), subject, if applicable, to payment pursuant to Section 2.4(b);
and

 

(iii) except as otherwise agreed by Parent and a holder thereof, provide that
each share of Company Common Stock that is subject to vesting or forfeiture
conditions (whether time-based or performance-based and whether granted under
a Company Stock Plan or otherwise) (each, a " _Restricted Share_ ") that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully
vested immediately prior to and contingent on the Closing, and provide that
each such share shall be treated as a share of Company Common Stock for all
purposes of this Agreement.

 

(b) Each holder of an Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and has an exercise price per share
that is less than the per share Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any
event no later than three business days after the Effective Time) a cash
amount equal to the Designated Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock then subject to the Option (subject to applicable Tax withholding and
without interest). For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Designated Consideration_ " means, with respect to any share of Company
Common Stock issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common
Stock over (ii) the exercise price payable in respect of such share of
Company Common Stock issuable under such Option.

SECTION 2.5  _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall take all
actions necessary to (i) terminate the ESPP in its entirety as of immediately
prior to the Closing Date, (ii) ensure that no offering period shall be
commenced on or after the date of this Agreement and (iii) if the Closing
shall occur prior to the end of the offering period in existence under the
ESPP on the date of this Agreement, cause a new exercise date to be set under
the ESPP, which date shall be the business day immediately prior to the
anticipated Closing Date.

 



8 SECTION 2.6 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II to
the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or
record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

ARTICLE III

corporate power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) on the Company.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means any
effect, change, event or occurrence (whether or not constituting any breach
of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement) that,

 



9  individually or in the aggregate with all other effects, changes, events or
occurrences (i) has a material adverse effect on the business, results of
operations, assets or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, or (ii) would or would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impair or delay the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ ,
however, that none of the following, and to the extent arising out of or
resulting from the following, no other effect, change, event or occurrence,
shall constitute or be taken into account , individually or in the aggregate,
in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or may occur:
any effect, change, event or occurrence (A) generally affecting (1) the
industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate or (2) the economy,
credit or financial or capital markets, in the United States or elsewhere in
the world, including changes in interest or exchange rates, or (B) to the
extent arising out of, resulting from or attributable to (1) changes in Law or
in generally accepted accounting principles or in accounting standards after
the date of this Agreement or prospective changes in Law or in generally
accepted accounting principles or in accounting standards, or any changes or
prospective changes in the interpretation or enforcement of any of the
foregoing, or any changes or prospective changes in general legal, regulatory
or political conditions, (2) the negotiation, execution or announcement of
this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions (other than for
purposes of any representation or warranty contained in Section 3.3(c) and
Section 3.4), including the impact thereof on relationships, contractual or
otherwise, with customers, suppliers, distributors, partners, employees or
regulators, or any litigation arising from allegations of breach of fiduciary
duty or violation of Law relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (3) acts of war (whether or not declared),
sabotage or terrorism, or any escalation or worsening of any such acts of war
(whether or not declared), sabotage or terrorism, (4) pandemics, earthquakes,
hurricanes, tornados or other natural disasters, (5) any action taken by the
Company or its Subsidiaries that is described in, and permitted to be taken
without consent under, clauses (i) through (xviii) of Section 5.1(a), that
were taken at the Parents written request or upon its advance written consent
pursuant to Section 5.1 or the failure by the Company or its Subsidiaries to
take any action that is prohibited by this Agreement to the extent Parent
fails to give its consent thereto after a written request therefor pursuant to
Section 5.1, (6) any change resulting or arising from the identity of, or any
facts or circumstances relating to, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates, (7) any change or prospective change in the Companys

milestones, budgets or internal or published financial or operating
predictions of revenue, earnings, cash flow or cash position (it being
understood that the exceptions in clauses (7), (8) and (9) shall not prevent
or otherwise affect a determination that the underlying cause of any such
decline or failure referred to therein (if not otherwise falling within any
of the exceptions provided by clause (A) and clauses (B)(1) through (6)
hereof) is a Material Adverse Effect); _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ ,
that any effect,

 



10  change, event or occurrence referred to in clauses (A) or (B)(1), (3) or (4)
may be taken into account in determining whether or not there has been a
Material Adverse Effect to the extent such effect, change, event or
occurrence has a materially disproportionate adverse affect on the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other participants in the
industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate (in which case the
incremental materially disproportionate impact or impacts may be taken into
account in determining whether or not there has been or may be a Material
Adverse Effect).

 

(b) Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization
except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

12 (d) The Company Common Stock constitutes the only outstanding class

Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (collectively, the " _Securities Act_ ").

dates (in the case of Company SEC Documents that are registration statements
filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their
respective SEC filing dates (in the case of all other Company SEC Documents),
the Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be,

Documents as of such respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of
this Agreement, the date of the filing of such amendment, with respect to the
disclosures that are amended) contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of

 



15  this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment
letters received from the SEC or its staff. As of the date of this Agreement,
none of the Companys Subsidiaries is subject to the reporting requirements

(b) The consolidated financial statements of the Company (including all
related notes or schedules) included or incorporated by reference in the
Company SEC Documents complied as to form, as of their respective dates of
filing with the SEC, in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto (except, in the case of unaudited

year-end adjustments that will not be material).

 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) except
liabilities (i) disclosed in the balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Balance Sheet Date (other than in the notes thereto)
included in the Filed SEC Documents, (ii) incurred after the Balance Sheet
Date in the ordinary course of business, (iii) as contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise in connection with the Transactions or (iv) as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There are
no unconsolidated Subsidiaries of the Company or any off-balance sheet
arrangements of any type (including any off-balance sheet arrangement required
to be disclosed pursuant to Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated under
the Securities Act) that have not been so described in the Company SEC
Documents nor any obligations to enter into any such arrangements.

(d) (i) Since February 3, 2008, subject to any applicable grace periods, the
Company and each of its officers and directors have been and are in compliance

to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its
Subsidiaries, required to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act
is made known to the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of
the Company by others within those entities. Neither the Company nor, to the
Companys Knowledge, the Companys independent registered public accounting
firm, has identified or been made aware of "significant deficiencies" or
"material weaknesses" (as defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board) in the design or operation of the Companys internal controls and
procedures which could reasonably adversely affect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data, in each case which has
not been subsequently remediated. To the Companys Knowledge, there is no
fraud, whether or not material, that involves the Companys management or
other employees who have a significant role in the preparation of financial
statements or the internal control over financial reporting utilized by the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

therein, the " _Schedule 13E-3_ ") shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement
(including any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to
stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting or, in the case of the Schedule 13E-3, on the date it and any
amendment or supplement to it is filed with the SEC, (A) with respect to the
Schedule 13E-3, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading or (B)
with respect to the Proxy Statement, contain any statement which, at the time
and in the light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or which omits to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or
misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication
with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Company Stockholders
Meeting or subject matter which has become false or misleading. The Proxy
Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company makes no representation with respect to statements made
or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by or on
behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3.

30 SECTION 4.4 _Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub_. Parent owns beneficially
and of record all of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
Transactions, has no assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other

prior to the Effective Time, will not have engaged in any other business
activities other than those relating to the Transactions.

 

SECTION 4.5 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and
complete copies, as of the date of this Agreement, of (i) an executed
commitment letter (the " _TPG Equity Funding Letter_ ") from TPG Partners VI,
L.P. and an executed commitment letter (the " _LGP Equity Funding Letter_ "
and, together with the TPG Equity Funding Letter, the " _Equity Funding
Letters_ ") from Green Equity Investors V, L.P. and Green Equity Investors
Side V, L.P. (collectively with TPG Partners V, L.P. the " _Equity Providers_
" and each an " _Equity Provider_ ") to each invest, in each case subject to
the terms and conditions therein, cash in the aggregate amount set forth
therein (being collectively referred to as the " _Equity Financing_ "), (ii)
an executed rollover commitment letter (the " _Rollover Letter_ ") from MD,
The Drexler Family Revocable Trust, The Millard S. Drexler 2009 Grantor
Retained Annuity Trust #1, The Millard S. Drexler 2009 Grantor Retained
Annuity Trust #2 (collectively, the " _Rollover Investors_ ") to contribute
to Parent, subject to the terms and conditions therein, the amount of Company
Common Stock set forth therein (the " _Rollover Investment_ ") and (iii) an
executed commitment letter and Redacted Fee Letters from the financial
institutions identified therein (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and,
together with the Equity Funding Letters, the " _Financing Letters_ ") to
provide, subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in the
amounts set forth therein (being collectively referred to as the " _Debt
Financing_ ", and together with the Equity Financing collectively referred to
as the " _Financing_ "). As of the date hereof, none of the Equity Funding
Letters, the Rollover Letter or Debt Commitment Letter has been amended or
modified, no such amendment or modification is contemplated (other than
amendments or modifications that are permitted by Section 5.5(a)), and the
respective obligations and commitments contained in such letters have not been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid any
and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Equity Funding
Letters, the Rollover Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter that are payable
on or prior to the date hereof. Assuming (i) the Financing is funded in
accordance with the Equity Funding Letters and the Debt Commitment Letter, as
applicable, (ii) the contribution contemplated by the Rollover Letter is made
in accordance with the terms of the Rollover Letter, (iii) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in Article III and (iv) performance
by the Company of its obligations under Section 5.1, as of the date hereof,
the net proceeds contemplated by the Equity Funding Letters and Debt
Commitment Letter will, together with Company cash and the contribution
contemplated

 



31  by the Rollover Letter, in the aggregate be sufficient for Merger Sub and
the Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and
Designated Consideration (and any repayment or refinancing of debt
contemplated by this Agreement, the Equity Funding Letters or the Debt
Commitment Letter) and any other amounts required to be paid in connection
with the consummation of the Transactions and to pay all related fees and
expenses. The Financing Letters and the Rollover Letter are in full force and
effect as of the date hereof. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other parties
thereto, under the Equity Funding Letters, Rollover Letter or the Debt
Commitment Letter; provided that Parent is not making any representation or
warranty regarding the effect of the inaccuracy of the representations and
warranties in Article III. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not
have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will
not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to Parent or
Merger Sub on the date of the Closing or that any of the conditions to the
contribution contemplated in the Rollover Letter will not be satisfied or that
the contribution contemplated by the Rollover Letter will not be made to
Parent on or before the date of the Closing; provided that Parent is not
making any representation regarding the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in Article III, or compliance by the Company of its
obligations hereunder. The Financing Letters contain all of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make Financing
available to Parent on the terms therein, and the Rollover Letter contains
all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder
to make the contribution to Parent described therein. As of the date hereof,
there are no side letters or other agreements, Contracts or arrangements to
which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related to the funding or
investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing other than as
expressly set forth in the Financing Letters, the Rollover Letter, the Interim
Investors Agreement and any customary engagement letter and non-disclosure
agreements that do not impact the conditionality or amount of the Financing.

 

SECTION 4.6 _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent has delivered to the Company the duly executed Guaranty. The Guaranty
is in full force and effect and is the valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of each Guarantor, and no event has occurred, which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part
of such Guarantor under such Guaranty.

SECTION 4.7 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions to
Parents obligation to consummate the Merger, and after giving effect to the
Transactions, including the Financing (as some or all of such Financing may be
amended or replaced in compliance with Section 5.5 hereof) and the payment of
the aggregate Merger Consideration, (b) any repayment or refinancing of debt
contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing Letters, (c) the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article
III hereof, (d) any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and
its Subsidiaries have been prepared in good faith based

 



32  upon assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable, (e) payment of all
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions, and (f) payment of all related fees and expenses, each of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective Time
and immediately after the consummation of the Transactions. For the purposes
of this Agreement, the term "Solvent" when used with respect to any Person,
means that, as of any date of determination (a) the amount of the "fair
saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (i)
the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other
liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined
in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency
of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including contingent and
other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (b) such Person
will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for
the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged following such date, and (c) such Person will be able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For
purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of
capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed
to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will be able to
generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a
combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

 

SECTION 4.8 _Certain Arrangements_. (a) Except as set forth in Section 4.8 of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule delivered to the Company on the date hereof
(the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ "), as of the date of this Agreement,
there are no Contracts or other agreements, arrangements or understandings
(whether oral or written) or commitments to enter into agreements,
arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written) (i) between Parent,
Merger Sub, the Guarantors or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and
any member of the Companys management or directors, on the other hand, as of

the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount
or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any stockholder
of the Company agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or the Merger or agrees
to vote against any Superior Proposal.

 

SECTION 4.9 _Brokers and Other Advisors_. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders,
financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries except for Persons, if any, whose fees and expenses will be
paid by Parent.

their respective stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or

stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or representatives in
anticipation or contemplation of any of the Transactions.

SECTION 4.11 _Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts,
Forward-Looking Statements and Business Plans_. In connection with the due
diligence investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and
Merger Sub have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as
well as certain business plan information, regarding the Company and its
business and operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there
are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business
plans, with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger
Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, as well as such business plans, so furnished to
them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information or business
plans), and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or
Representatives, with respect thereto.

SECTION 4.12 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or

necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect
to the solicitation of proxies for the Company Stockholders Meeting which has
become false or misleading.

 

SECTION 4.13 _Litigation_. To the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, as of the
date of this Agreement, there is no (a) pending or threatened Action against
Parent or Merger Sub or (b) any injunction, order, judgment, ruling, decree or
writ imposed upon Parent or Merger Sub, in each case, by or before any
Governmental Authority, that seeks to enjoin, or would reasonably be likely
to have the effect of preventing, making illegal, or otherwise interfering
with, any of the Transactions, except as would not reasonably be expected to
impair in any material respect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform
its obligations hereunder or prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Transactions.

Takeover Proposal made in writing provided to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including any financing commitments relating thereto,
which shall include any Redacted Fee Letters) and (ii) a written summary of
the material terms of any such Takeover Proposal not made in writing
(including any financing commitments and any Redacted Fee Letters relating
thereto).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(b) or
any other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time on or after the No-
Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company or any of its Representatives receives a written
Takeover Proposal from any Person or group of Persons, which
Takeover Proposal was made by an Excluded Party or which Takeover Proposal
was made or renewed on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date and did not
result from any breach of this Section 5.2, (A) the Company and its
Representatives may contact such Person or group of Persons to clarify the
terms and conditions thereof and (B) if the Special Committee determines in
good faith, after consultation with independent financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company and its
Representatives may (x) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, information (including non-public information) with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made
such Takeover Proposal; _provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and in any
event within 48 hours) provide to Parent any material non-public information
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to any
Person given such access which was not previously provided to Parent or its
Representatives and (y) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions
or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such Takeover
Proposal. From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall
promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) provide to Parent (i) an
unredacted copy of any such Takeover Proposal made in writing provided to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries

 



41  (including any financing commitments (including any Redacted Fee Letters)
relating thereto) and (ii) a written summary of the material terms of any such
Takeover Proposal not made in writing (including any financing commitments
relating thereto).

(d) Following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of any material developments, discussions or negotiations
regarding any Takeover Proposal (whether made before or after the No-Shop
Period Start Date) on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours) and
upon the request of Parent shall apprise Parent of the status of such Takeover
Proposal. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into
any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof
which prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in
accordance with this Section 5.2.

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.2(e) or Section 5.2(f),
the Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i)(A) fail to recommend to
its stockholders that the Company Stockholder Approval be given (the "
_Company Board Recommendation_ ") or fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw
or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (C)
take any formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in

against such offer or a customary "stop, look and listen" communication by
the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act or (D) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend to the stockholders of the Company a Takeover Proposal
(actions described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company
Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement or
agreement in principle with respect to any Takeover Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (each, a " _Company Acquisition
Agreement_ ") or (iii) take any action pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the
Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Takeover
Proposal not solicited in violation of this Section 5.2 or take any action
pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) if the Board of Directors of the
Company (acting upon recommendation of the Special Committee) has determined
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, (x) that failure to take such action could be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1)
the Company has given Parent at least three calendar days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall include an
unredacted copy of the Superior Proposal, an unredacted copy of the relevant
proposed

 



42  transaction agreements and a copy of any financing commitments (including
Redacted Fee Letters) relating thereto and a written summary of the material
terms of any Superior Proposal not made in writing, including any financing
commitments relating thereto), (2) the Company has negotiated, and has caused
its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement, the Financing Letters and the
Guaranty such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal, (3) following the end of such notice
period, the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon recommendation of
the Special Committee) shall have considered in good faith any proposed
revisions to this Agreement, the Financing Letters, the Rollover Letter and
the Guaranty proposed in writing by Parent in a manner that would form a
binding contract if accepted by the Company, and shall have determined that
the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such
revisions were to be given effect and (4) in the event of any material change
to the material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each
case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that
described in clause (1) above and the notice period shall have recommenced,
except that the notice period shall be at least one calendar day (rather than
the three calendar days otherwise contemplated by clause (1) above); and
provided, further that the Company has complied in all material respects
with its obligations under this Section 5.2 and provided, further, that any
purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to this sentence shall be
void and of no force and effect, unless the Company termination is in
accordance with Section 7.1 and, to the extent required under the terms of
this Agreement, the Company pays Parent the applicable Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 7.3 prior to or concurrently with such termination.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Board of
Directors of the Company may change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or
publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation (" _Change of
Recommendation_ ") if the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon
recommendation of the Special Committee) has determined in good faith, after
consultation its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to
take such action could be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that such action shall not be
in response to a Superior Proposal (which is addressed under Section 5.2(e))
and prior to taking such action, (x) the Board of Directors of the Company has
given Parent at least three calendar days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action and a description of the reasons for taking
such action, (y) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to revise
the terms of this Agreement, the

 



43  Financing Letters, the Rollover Letter and the Guaranty in such a manner
that would obviate the need for taking such action and (z) following the end
of such notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon
recommendation of the Special Committee) shall have considered in good faith
any revisions to this Agreement, the Financing Letters, the Rollover Letter
and the Guaranty proposed in writing by Parent in a manner that would form a
binding contract if accepted by the Company, and shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that failure to effect a Change of Recommendation could be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(g) Nothing in this Section 5.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit
the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company
a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , that any
disclosures permitted under this Section 5.2(g) that does not contain either
an express rejection of any applicable Takeover Proposal or an express
reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation shall be deemed a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company that is required by applicable Law; _provided_
that making such disclosure shall not in any way limit or modify the effect,
if any, that any such action has under Section 5.2.

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries) or "group", within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act, relating to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions,
any (A) acquisition of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries equal to 20%
or more of the Companys consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of the
Companys revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (B)
acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock, (C) tender
offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock, (D)
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or (E)
any combination of the foregoing types of transactions if the sum of
the percentage of consolidated assets, consolidated revenues or earnings and
Company Common Stock involved is 20% or more; in each case, other than the
Transactions.

 

(i) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
(acting through the Special Committee) has determined, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, in its good faith judgment is
reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into
account all legal, regulatory and financial aspects (including certainty of
closing) of the

 



44  proposal and the Person making the proposal, and if consummated, would
result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders (solely
in their capacity as such, and excluding the Rollover Investors) from a
financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
(including any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
response to such proposal or otherwise); _provided_ that for purposes of the
definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to "20%" in the definition
of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

 

SECTION 5.3 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 5.3(b), the Company shall take all actions in
accordance with applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents and the rules
of the New York Stock Exchange to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
a meeting of its stockholders (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof, the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining
the Stockholder Approvals, as soon as reasonably practicable after the SEC
confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement or Schedule
13E-3. Subject to Section 5.2, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company in its sole
discretion may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting (i) after
consultation with Parent, and with Parents consent, to the extent necessary
to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is
provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time
in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting or (ii) if as of the time for
which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth
in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement and file it with the
SEC and the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and file the Schedule
13E-3 with the SEC and the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other
in connection with the preparation of the foregoing. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments received from the SEC or its staff concerning the
Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 and shall cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
resolution of any such comments; provided, that the Company shall be under no
obligation to mail the Proxy Statement to its stockholders prior to the No-
Shop Period Start Date. The Company shall notify Parent promptly upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government
officials and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any

 



45  other government officials for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 and shall supply Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
cooperate with the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of
the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3, including promptly furnishing to
the Company in writing upon request any and all information relating to it as
may be required to be set forth in the Proxy Statement or Schedule 13E-3
under applicable Law. Parent shall ensure that such information supplied by it
in writing for inclusion (or incorporation by reference) in the Proxy
Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 will not, on the date it is first mailed to
stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting or filed with the SEC (as applicable), contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement, filing the Schedule 13E-3 or filing any other required filings (or,
in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response and shall consider Parents comments in good faith. The Company shall
ensure that the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 (i) will not, with
respect to the Proxy Statement, on the date it is first mailed to
stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting and, with respect to the Schedule 13E-3, the date it is first filed
with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading and (ii) will comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company assumes no responsibility with
respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger
Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or the
Schedule 13E-3.

SECTION 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts
(unless, with respect to any action, another standard of performance is
expressly provided for herein) to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably
practicable and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious

clauses (i) through (iv) other than with respect to filings, notices,
petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications
and other documents, approvals, consents, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations relating to Antitrust Laws, which are
dealt with in Section 5.4(c) below. For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ "
means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act,
the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, all applicable foreign antitrust
Laws and all other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that are
designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition through merger or acquisition.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and
Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (x) take all action
necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or
becomes applicable to any of the Transactions and (y) if the restrictions of
any state takeover statute or similar Law become applicable to any of the
Transactions, take all action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise lawfully minimize the effect of such Law on the
Transactions.

 

(c) Each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification
and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as
promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event within ten business days
of the date hereof and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act and to promptly take any and all steps necessary to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all consents under any
Antitrust Laws that may be required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or
local Governmental Authority, in each case with competent jurisdiction, so as
to enable the parties to close the Transactions.

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental

 



47  Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding initiated
by a private Person, (ii) keep the other party informed in all material
respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
(the "DOJ") or any other Governmental Authority and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions, (iii) subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, and to the extent
reasonably practicable, consult with the other party with respect to
information relating to the other parties and their respective Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third Person and/or any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions, other than "4(c) documents" as that term is
used in the rules and regulations under the HSR Act, and (iv) to the extent
permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Authority
or other person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences.

SECTION 5.5 _Financing_.

(a) (i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing
on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) described in the
Financing Letters, and the contribution contemplated by the Rollover Letter
pursuant to the terms thereof, and shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under, the
Financing Letters or the Rollover Letter if such amendment, modification or
waiver (A) with respect to the Financing Letters, reduces (or could have the
effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount unless (x)
the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding
amount or the Debt Financing is otherwise made available to fund such fees or
original issue discount and (y) after giving effect to any of the transactions
referred to in clause (x) above, the representation and warranty set forth in
Section 4.7 shall be true and correct) or, with respect to the Rollover
Letter, reduces the amount of Company Common Stock to be contributed thereby
unless (x) the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing is increased by a
corresponding amount and (y) after giving effect to any of the transactions
referred to in clause (x) above, the representation and warranty set forth in
Section 4.7 shall be true and correct as of the time of such transaction or
(B) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or
modifies any of the conditions to the Financing or the contribution
contemplated by the Rollover Letter, or otherwise expands, amends or modifies
any other provision of the Financing Letters or the Rollover Letter, in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) delay or prevent or make less
likely the funding of the Financing or the contribution contemplated by
the Rollover Letter (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing or
the contribution contemplated by the Rollover Letter) on the Closing Date or
(y)

 



48  adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as
applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to the Financing
Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto or the Rollover
Letter, in each of clauses (x) and (y) in any material respect (provided that,
subject to compliance with the other provisions of this Section 5.5(a), Parent
and Merger Sub may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add additional
lenders, arrangers, bookrunners and agents). Parent shall promptly deliver to
the Company copies of any such amendment, modification or replacement. For
purposes of this Section 5.5, references to "Financing" shall include the
financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as permitted to be amended,
modified or replaced by this Section 5.5(a), references to the "Rollover
Investment" shall include the financing contemplated by the Rollover Letter
as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this Section 5.5(a) and
references to "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as
permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this Section 5.5(a). 

(ii) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts (A)
to maintain in effect the Financing Letters and the Rollover Letter, (B) to
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (or on terms no less favorable to
Parent or Merger Sub than the terms and conditions (including flex provisions)
in the Debt Commitment Letter), (C) to satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions to funding in the Debt Commitment Letter and such definitive
agreements thereto (other than any condition where the failure to be so
satisfied is a direct result of the Companys failure to furnish information
described in Section 5.5(b)) and in the Equity Funding Letters and the
Rollover Letter and to consummate the Financing and make the Rollover
Investment at or prior to the Closing, including using its reasonable best
efforts (including, other than with respect to the providers of the Equity
Financing, through litigation pursued in good faith) to cause the lenders and
the other persons committing to fund the Financing and make the Rollover
Investment to fund the Financing and make the Rollover Investment at the
Closing, (D) to enforce its rights (including, other than with respect to the
providers of the Equity Financing, through litigation pursued in good faith)
under the Financing Letters and Rollover Letter and (E) to comply with its
obligations under the Financing Letters and the Rollover Letter. Parent shall
keep the Company informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide to the Company
copies of the material definitive agreements for the Debt Financing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give
the Company prompt notice (x) of any breach or default by any party to any of
the Financing Letters, Rollover Letter, or definitive agreements related to
the Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub become aware, (y) of the receipt
of (A) any written notice or (B) other written communication, in each case
from any Financing source with respect to any (1) actual or potential breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing
Letters, Rollover Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing of

 



49  any provisions of the Financing Letters, Rollover Letter or definitive
agreements related to the Financing or (2) material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to any of the Financing Letters, Rollover Letter
or definitive agreements related to the Financing with respect to the
obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded
at Closing, and (z) if at any time for any reason Parent or Merger Sub
believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion
of the Financing or the Rollover Investment on the terms and conditions, in
the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the Financing Letters,
the Rollover Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing. As
soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two business days of
the date the Company delivers to Parent or Merger Sub a written request,
Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by
the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z)
of the immediately preceding sentence; _provided_ , that they need not provide
any information believed to be privileged or that is requested for purposes
of litigation. Upon the occurrence of any circumstance referred to in clause
(x), (y)(A) or (z) of the second preceding sentence or if any portion of the
Debt Financing or Rollover Investment otherwise becomes unavailable, and such
portion is reasonably required to fund the aggregate Merger Consideration and
all fees, expenses and other amounts contemplated to be paid by Parent, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Agreement, Parent and
Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in
replacement thereof alternative financing from alternative sources in an
amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions with terms and conditions
not materially less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub (or their Affiliates)
than the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Rollover Letter, as applicable, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall deliver to the Company
true and complete copies of all Contracts or other arrangements (including
Redacted Fee Letters) pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have
committed to provide any portion of the Debt Financing or the Rollover
Investment. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of
the Financing and the Rollover Investment, or any alternative financing, is
not a condition to Closing.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 5.5 or in any other
provision of this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be
required (A) to amend or waive any of the terms or conditions hereof or (B)
except as specified in clause (b) of the proviso in Section 1.2, to consummate
the Closing any earlier than the final day of the Marketing Period.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide to Parent and Merger Sub, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives, including legal and
accounting, to provide, in each case at Parents sole expense, all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is customary in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing or any permitted replacement, amended,
modified or alternative financing (collectively with the 

 



50  Financing, the " _Available Financing_ " it being understood that for
purposes of this Section 5.5, for the avoidance of doubt, Available Financing
shall include any offering of debt securities or incurrence of loans
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter) ( _provided_ that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries), which reasonable best efforts shall include
(i) (A) furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and their Financing sources, as
promptly as reasonably practicable following Parents request, with such
pertinent and customary information (other than financial information, which
is covered by clause (ii) below), to the extent reasonably available to the
Company, regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably
requested in writing by Parent to consummate the offerings of debt securities
contemplated by the Available Financing at the time during the Companys
fiscal year such offerings will be made and (B) furnishing Parent and Merger
Sub and their Financing sources, as promptly as reasonably
practicable following Parents request, with information (other than
financial information, which is covered by clause (ii) below) regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including information to be used in the
preparation of one or more information packages regarding the business,
operations, financial projections and prospects of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) customary for the arrangement of loans contemplated by the
Available Financing (the " _Bank Financing_ "), to the extent reasonably
available to the Company and reasonably requested in writing by Parent to
assist in preparation of customary offering or information documents or rating
agency or lender presentations relating to such arrangement of loans, (ii)
furnishing all financial statements, pro forma financial statements and other
financial data and financial information of the Company and its Subsidiaries
that is required under paragraph 3, 4 and, excluding textual descriptions of
the Companys business and financial results (other than what is customary

Exhibit E to the Debt Commitment Letter (as in effect on the date of this
Agreement); provided that the Company shall only be required to furnish pro
forma financial statements or forecasts if Parent or Merger Sub has provided
the Company information relating to the proposed debt and equity
capitalization at least 15 days prior to the date pro forma financial
statements are required to be delivered (the information, financial
statements, pro forma financial statements, business and other financial data
and financial information referred to in clause (i) and (ii) above shall mean
the " _Required Information_ "), (iii) participating in a reasonable number of
meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as
lead arrangers, bookrunners or agents for, and prospective lenders and
purchasers of, the Available Financing and senior management and
Representatives, with appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company),
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and
sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Available Financing,
(iv) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, offering documents, bank information memoranda, and similar
documents required in connection with the Available Financing; _provided_
that any offering documents in relation to debt securities need not

 



51  be issued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any rating agency presentations, offering documents, bank
information memoranda, and similar documents required in connection with the
Available Financing shall contain disclosure reflecting the Surviving
Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor, (v) using reasonable best
efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters and legal opinions reasonably

Effective Time) and customary closing certificates and documents as may be

the Effective Time, (xi) in connection with the Bank Financing or any bridge

_provided_ , _however_ , that, no obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any agreement, certificate, document or instrument (other
than the authorization letters referred to above) shall be effective until
the Effective Time and, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee or incur
any other liability in connection with the Available Financing prior to the
Effective Time. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Available Financing; _provided_
that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries
contemplated by this Section 5.5 and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with (x) the arrangement of the

respect to any information provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and (y) any matters relating to an Internal Restructuring.

 

(c) The Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in Parents review of
and planning for any internal restructuring or reorganization of
subsidiaries, assets or liabilities (an " _Internal Restructuring_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Company shall not be required to take
any actions to implement any steps (other than the creation of newly-formed
entities; provided that no transfer of assets to such entities shall be
required) on such Internal Restructuring (A) unless Parent and Merger Sub have
confirmed in writing that they are prepared to proceed immediately to Closing
and the Company is satisfied that the Closing will immediately occur
thereafter or (B) if such action would contravene any Company Charter Document
(or with respect to the Companys Subsidiaries, any organizational document)
or Law; and (ii) such cooperation will not unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of the Company.

SECTION 5.6 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, and subject to
the provisions of Section 5.2, unless and until a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change has occurred in accordance with Section 5.2(e), so long
as this Agreement is in effect, 

 



53  neither the Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement (to the extent not previously
issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Merger,
this Agreement or the other Transactions without first consulting with the
other party, except as may be required by Law, applicable fiduciary duties or
by any applicable listing agreement with or rules of a national securities
exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the request of any
Governmental Authority.

 

SECTION 5.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Laws, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall afford to Parent and Parents
Representatives and sources of Debt Financing reasonable access during normal
business hours to the Companys officers, employees, agents, properties,
books, Contracts and records and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent
such information concerning its business, personnel, assets, liabilities and
properties as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ that Parent and its
representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company;
_provided_ __, _further_ _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated
to provide such access or information if the Company determines, in
its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or a
Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third-party, waive the
protection of an attorney-client privilege, or expose the Company to risk of
liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information. Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Company does not provide access
or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall provide notice
to Parent that it is withholding such access or information and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable
information in a way that would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or
obligation or risk waiver of such privilege. Without limiting the generality
of this Section 5.7, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,
the Company will furnish to the Parent promptly after becoming available (to
the extent such items become available), (i) monthly financial statements,
including an unaudited balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash
flows for each month through the Closing Date, as it may prepare for
managements internal use, (ii) any update of its outlook for the quarter or
the balance of the fiscal year as it may prepare for managements internal
use and (iii) monthly same store results. Until the Effective Time, the
information provided will be subject to the terms of the letter agreement
dated as of November 16, 2010, by and among the Company, TPG Capital, L.P.
and Leonard Green and Partners, L.P. (as may be amended from time to time, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "); it being understood and agree that any
such information may be disclosed as contemplated by Section 5.5(b).

SECTION 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, if the

 



54  subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain
such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent and (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings
commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which
relate to the Transactions.

 

SECTION 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the
Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director
or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an "
_Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all
claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs
(including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including
fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any claim, suit,
action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or
in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was a director or officer of the
Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the
Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company
or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary
(including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such
Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of
another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case under (A)
or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any claim,
suit, action, proceeding or investigation relating in whole or in part to the
Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnitee), to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, and (ii) assume all obligations of the
Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time as provided in the Company Charter Documents and the
organizational documents of such Subsidiaries as currently in effect. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall
cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the certificate of incorporation and
by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable
to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this
Agreement in the Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from the
Effective Time Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
advance any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any
Indemnitee under this Section 5.9 (including in connection with enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations referred to in this Section 5.9) as incurred
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided that the
individual to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such advances if it shall be determined that such person is not entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.9(a).

 



55 (b) The Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to assume and control the defense of any threatened or actual
litigation, claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered
under this Section 5.9 (each, a " _Claim_ ") unless there is a conflict
of interest between Parent and the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand,
and the Indemnitee, on the other (for the avoidance of doubt, conflict of
interest shall be deemed to exist in the event of any threatened or actual
litigation, claim or proceeding relating to the Transactions); provided, that
none of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any such Claim for which
indemnification has been sought by an Indemnitee hereunder, unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnitee from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnitee
otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. Each
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in
the defense of any Claim and shall provide access to properties and
individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.

(c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those individuals
who are currently (and any additional individuals who prior to the Effective
Time become) covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policy on terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and in
amount, no less favorable to such individuals than those of such policy in
effect on the date hereof (or Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued
by reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage with respect to matters
existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, including a "tail" policy);
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if the annual premium for such insurance shall
exceed 300% of the current annual premium (such 300% threshold, the " _Maximum
Premium_ "), then Parent shall provide or cause to be provided a policy for
the applicable individuals with the best coverage as shall then be available
at an annual premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium. The Company may
prior to the Effective Time purchase, for an aggregate amount not to exceed
the aggregate Maximum Premium for six years, a six-year prepaid "tail policy"
on terms and conditions providing at least substantially equivalent benefits
as the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters
existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation
the transactions contemplated hereby. If such prepaid "tail policy" has been
obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to
obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 5.9(c)

 



56  and the Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and
to honor all of its obligations thereunder.

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may
have under the Company Charter Documents, by contract or otherwise. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.9
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.9 applies unless (x) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected
Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification
(it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.9
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.9).

 

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this Section 5.9.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 5.9 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

SECTION 5.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer
of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

 

SECTION 5.11 _Employee Matters_.

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to those employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries who are actively employed as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ ") annual base salary and base wages,
short-

 



57  term cash incentive compensation opportunities and benefits (excluding
equity-based compensation), that are substantially comparable, in the
aggregate, to such annual base salary and base wages, short-term cash
incentive compensation opportunities and benefits (excluding equity-based
compensation) provided to the Company Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment of
any Company employee.

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and levels of
benefits (but not actual accrual) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee after the
Effective Time (including the Company Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each
Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Company Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that
the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result
in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each Company Employee to
be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and
all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing
comparable coverage under a Company Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable
or waived under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries
in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Company Employees participation
in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.11 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 5.11 is intended
to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to
any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no current or
former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the Agreement or have
the right to enforce the provisions hereof.

 



58 SECTION 5.12 _Notification of Certain Matters; Stockholder Litigation_. Prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and
the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of any actions, suits, claims
or proceedings commenced or, to the Companys Knowledge on the one hand and
Parents knowledge, on the other hand, threatened against such party which
relate to this Agreement and the Transactions. The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to
this Agreement and the Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 

SECTION 5.13 _SEC Filings_. The Company shall file with the SEC (i) a Form
10-K with respect to its fiscal year ended January 29, 2011 on or prior to
March 14, 2011 and (ii) at and after such time as the Parent notifies the
Company that it is commencing bona fide marketing relating to the Debt
Financing, a Form 8-K with the Financial Information for the period from the
date of the most recently disclosed financial statements included in an SEC
Report through the most recent month ended at least 15 days earlier; provided
that Financial Information shall include period to date same store
sales; period to date revenue; and reaffirmed or revised guidance for full
quarter same store sales, revenue, gross margin and earnings per share.

SECTION 5.14 _Director Resignations_. Prior to the Closing, other than with
respect to any directors identified by Parent in writing to the Company two
days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to deliver to Parent resignations executed by each director of the
Company in office immediately prior to the Effective Time, which resignations
shall be effective at the Effective Time.

 

SECTION 5.15 _Parent and Merger Sub Expenditure; Parent Distributions_. From
the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, (i) Parent and Merger
Sub shall not expend funds other than in connection with the Transactions and
the payment of related expenses and (ii) Parent shall not declare, set aside,
make or pay any dividend or other distribution with respect to any of its
capital stock.

SECTION 5.16 _Parent Vote_.

 

(a) Parent shall vote (or consent with respect to) or cause to be voted (or a
consent to be given with respect to) any Company Common Stock beneficially
owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to which it or any of
its Subsidiaries has the power (by agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause to
be voted or to provide a consent), in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
at any meeting of

 



59  stockholders of the company at which this Agreement shall be submitted for
adoption and at all adjournments or postponements thereof (or, if applicable,
by any action of stockholders of the Company by consent in lieu of a
meeting).

(b) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall
execute and deliver, in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL and in its
capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written consent adopting the
Agreement.

Section 5.17 _Section 280G Matters_. No later than 10 business days following
the date of this Agreement with respect to each "officer" of the Company (as
defined in Rule 16a-1 promulgated under Exchange Act) (each, a " _Section 16
Officer_ ") and no later than 20 business days following the date of this
Agreement, with respect to any other "disqualified individual" of the Company
(as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code), the Company shall furnish a
schedule that sets forth (i) the Companys reasonable, good faith estimate of
the maximum amount (separately identifying single and double-trigger amounts
and any tax gross-up payments) that could be paid to such Section 16 Officer
or other disqualified individual as a result of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event),
(ii) the "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for
each such Section 16 Officer or other disqualified individual, and (iii) the
underlying documentation on which such calculations are based. The schedules
and underlying documentation required by this Section 5.17 shall be updated
and delivered to Parent not later than twenty (20) business days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date.

ARTICLE VI __

enacted, promulgated, issued, entered, amended or enforced by any

the Company (i) set forth in Section 3.6(b) shall be true and correct as of
the Effective Time as if made on and as of the Effective Time, (ii) set forth
in Section 3.2(a), Section 3.14 and Section 3.20, without giving effect to any
materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications therein, shall be
true and correct in all material respects at and as of the Effective Time with
the same effect as though made as of the Effective Time (except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date), and

Effective Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in

the failure to be true and correct would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Parent shall have received a certificate signed on
behalf of the Company by an executive officer of the Company to such effect.
Solely for the purposes of clause (ii) above, if one or more inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.2(a) or Section 3.20
would cause the aggregate amount required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub
to effectuate the Merger, refinance the Companys Indebtedness, indirectly
acquire all of the outstanding equity interests in the Companys subsidiaries,
consummate the Transactions to be consummated on the Closing Date and pay all

4.7) shall be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Effective Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in
which case as of such date) except where such failures to be so true and
correct would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect and (ii) set forth in Section 4.7 of this Agreement shall be true and
correct in all material respects as of the Effective Time. The Company shall
have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub by an
officer of Parent and Merger Sub as to the effect of the preceding sentence.

Sub shall have performed in all material respects all obligations required to
be performed by them under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and
the Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by an

Section 6.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 6.2
or 6.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such
partys failure to use the standard of efforts required from such party to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including as required by and subject to Sections 5.4 and 5.5.

ARTICLE VII _ _

_Termination_

SECTION 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before
or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (except as otherwise
expressly noted):

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent duly authorized
by each of their respective Boards of Directors (in the case of the Company,
acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee); or

(b) by either of the Company or Parent:

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before May 18, 2011
(the " _Walk-Away Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)(i) shall not be available
to a party if the failure of the Merger to have been consummated on or before
the Walk-Away Date was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform
in all material respects any of its obligations under this Agreement;

 



62 (ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 6.1(d) shall be
in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to a party if the issuance of such
final, non-appealable Restraint was primarily due to the failure of such
party to perform in all material respects any of its obligations under this
Agreement;

(iii) if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Company Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof; or

 

(c) by Parent,

(i) (A) if the representations and warranties of the Company shall not be true
and correct or the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement (except the covenants and
agreements in Section 5.2, which failure to be true and correct, breach or
failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth
in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 and (ii) cannot be cured by the Company by the

to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(i) and the basis
for such termination (or, if earlier, the Walk-Away Date); or (B) the Company

Walk-Away Date or if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured (x)
within 5 business days following receipt of written notice from the Parent of

_provided_ that, Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(i) if either Parent or Merger Sub is then in

agreements hereunder that would result in the conditions to Closing set forth
in Section 6.1 or Section 6.3 not being satisfied; or

be true and correct or Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to
perform any of their covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement,
which failure to be true and correct, breach or failure to perform (A) would
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or Section
6.3 and (B) cannot be cured by the Walk-Away Date, or if capable of being
cured, shall not have commenced to have been cured within 15 days following
receipt by the Parent or Merger Sub of written notice of such breach or

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(d)(i) and the basis for
such termination (or, if earlier, the Walk-Away Date); provided that, the
Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

conditions to Closing set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 not being
satisfied; or

SECTION 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall be given
to the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to
which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null
and void (other than Sections 7.2 and 7.3, Article VIII, the expense
reimbursement and indemnification provisions of Section 5.5(b), and the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Guaranty, all of which shall survive
termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective directors, officers and
Affiliates, except (i) the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries may have liability pursuant to the sections specified
in the immediately preceding sentence that survive such termination and (ii)
nothing shall relieve any party from liability for fraud.

 

SECTION 7.3 _Termination Fee_.

(a) In the event that:

(i) (A) a bona fide Takeover Proposal shall have been made, proposed or
communicated (and not withdrawn), after the date hereof and prior to the

there has been no Company Stockholders Meeting), and (B) following the
occurrence of an event described in the preceding clause (A), this Agreement
is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or
Section 7.1(b)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) and (C) within
12 months of the date this Agreement is terminated, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal and such Takeover
Proposal is consummated (in each case whether or not the Takeover
Proposal was the same Takeover Proposal referred to in clause (A));
_provided_ that for purposes of clause (C) of this Section 7.3(a)(i), the
references to "20%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to
be references to "50%"); or

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(ii); or

(iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
7.1(c)(ii) or (B) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii) and prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting
the Board of Directors of the Company has made a Change of Recommendation;

 



65 then, in any such event under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section
7.3(a), the Company shall pay if and as directed by Parent or its designee the
applicable Termination Fee (as defined below) to Parent or its designee by
wire transfer of same day funds (x) in the case of Section
7.3(a)(iii), within two business days after such termination, (y)
simultaneously with such termination if pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) or (z)
in the case of Section 7.3(a)(i), two business days after the consummation of
a Takeover Proposal; it being understood that in no event shall the Company
be required to pay the applicable Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
As used herein, " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal to $54.0
million, except that in the event that this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) (1) on or after the No-Shop Period
Start Date in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Takeover Proposal with a Person or group of Persons that at such time is an
Excluded Party or (2) prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date, the "Termination
Fee" shall mean a cash amount equal to $27.0 million. In the event that Parent
or its designee shall receive full payment pursuant to this Section 7.3(a)
and Section 7.3(c), together with reimbursement of any applicable expenses
pursuant to Section 7.3(d), the receipt of the applicable Termination Fee,
Parent Expenses and the expenses referred to Section 7.3(d) shall be deemed
to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any
other person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof),
the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Sub,
any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any
of its Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such
termination;  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 7.3(a)
shall limit the rights of Parent and Merger Sub under Section 8.8.

(b) In the event that:

(i) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i);
or

(ii) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(iii);

then in any such event under clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 7.3(b), if
the condition set forth in Section 6.2(c) are satisfied, then Parent shall
pay to the Company a termination fee of $200 million in cash (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event shall Parent be
required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. In the
event that Company shall receive full payment pursuant to this Section 7.3(b),
together with indemnification pursuant to Section 5.5(b) or reimbursement of
any applicable expenses pursuant to Section 7.3(d), the receipt of the Parent
Termination Fee together with such expenses shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages for any and all

 



66  losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company or any other Person in
connection with this Agreement, the Financing Letters, the Rollover Letter or
the Guaranty (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (and the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, and neither the Company nor any other
Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding
against Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Related Party arising out of or
in connection with this Agreement, the Financing Letters, the Rollover Letter
or the Guaranty, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or
the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for
such termination.

(c) In the event that:

(i) The Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii)
or Section 7.1(d)(ii); or

(ii) Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(b)(iii), Section 7.1(c)(i) or Section 7.1(c)(ii);

then in any such event the Company shall pay Parent or its designees,
as promptly as possible (but in any event within 2 business days) following
the delivery by Parent of an invoice therefor, all out-of-pocket fees and
expenses incurred by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Financing (" _Parent Expenses_ "); provided that the Company shall not be
required to pay more than an aggregate of $5 million in Parent Expenses
pursuant to this Section 7.3(c). The expenses payable pursuant to this
Section 7.3(c) shall be paid by wire transfer of same day funds within ten
business days after demand therefor following the occurrence of the
termination event giving rise to the payment obligation described in this
Section 7.3(c). The payment of the expense reimbursement pursuant to this
Section 7.3(c) shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to
pay the applicable Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(a).

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that without
these agreements, the other parties would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay
any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order to obtain the
payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences an Action which
results in a judgment against the other party, with respect to Parent or
Merger Sub, or parties, with respect to the Company for the payment set forth
in this Section 7.3, such paying party shall pay the other party or parties,
as applicable, its reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in the
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date such payment was actually received. 

 



67 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but
subject to the Companys rights set forth in Section 8.8 and the
reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent under Section 5.5(b)
and Section 7.3(d) hereof, the Companys right to receive payment of the
Parent Termination Fee from Parent or the Guarantors pursuant to the Guaranty
in respect thereof shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and stockholders against Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors,
the parties to the Rollover Letter, the Financing Sources of the Debt
Financing or any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, financing sources, managers, members,
directors, officers or Affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent Related
Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to
be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise,
and upon payment of such amount none of the Parent Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement but subject to Section 8.8 and the proviso to this
sentence, Parents right to receive payment from the Company of (i) the
Parent Expenses pursuant to Section 7.3(c) and/or (ii) the applicable
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(a) shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the Company and its Subsidiaries
and any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors,
partners, stockholders, managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, "
_Company Related Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a result of the failure
of the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount(s), none of the
Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions (except that
the Company shall also be obligated with respect to Section 7.3(d)). For the
avoidance of doubt, (1) under no circumstances will the Company be entitled
to monetary damages in excess of the amount of the Parent Termination Fee (and
any indemnification pursuant to Section 7.3(d)) and (2) while the Company may
pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 8.8
and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee under Section 7.3 (b), under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by the preceding
sentence and any money damages, including all or any portion of the Parent
Termination Fee.

ARTICLE VIII  __

_Miscellaneous_

SECTION 8.1 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. This Article VIII
and the agreements of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in 

 



68  Article II, Section 5.9 (Indemnification and Insurance) shall survive the
consummation of the Merger (in the case of the Confidentiality Agreement,
subject to the terms thereof). All other representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall not survive the consummation
of the Merger.

 

SECTION 8.2 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, by
written agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by their respective
Boards of Directors (in the case of the Company, acting upon
recommendation of the Special Committee); _provided_ , _however_ , that
following approval of the Transactions by the stockholders of the Company,
there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law
would require further approval by the stockholders of the Company without
such approval.

SECTION 8.3 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto,
(b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts
of any other party hereto or (c) subject to the requirements of applicable
law, waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements contained
herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such partys
conditions; provided, that no such action shall be taken by the Company
unless it is taken upon the recommendation of the Special Committee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party.

 

SECTION 8.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties; _provided_ , however, that Parent or Merger Sub
may assign this Agreement to any of their Affiliates (provided that such
assignment shall not (i) affect the obligations of any Equity Provider under
the applicable Equity Funding Letter, the Rollover Investor under the Rollover
Letter or any Guarantors under the Guaranty or (ii) impede or delay
the consummation of the Transactions or otherwise materially impede the
rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement); and provided,
further, that the Company has given its prior consent to any such assignment
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). No
assignment by any party shall relieve such party of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported
assignment not permitted under this Section shall be null and void.

 



69 SECTION 8.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts (each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall
become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties.

SECTION 8.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
including the Company Disclosure Schedules and the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, together with the Equity Funding Letters, the Rollover Letter, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Guaranty, (a) constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties and their Affiliates, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and (b) except for: (i) if
the Effective Time occurs (A) the right of the Companys stockholders to
receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time and (B) the right of
the holders of Options to receive the Designated Consideration; (ii) the
provisions set forth in Section 5.9 of this Agreement, (iii) the rights of
persons who are explicitly provided to be third party beneficiaries of the
Guaranty, the Equity Funding Letter and the Rollover Letter solely to the
extent of the rights set forth therein, (iv) the rights of the Parent Related
Parties and the Company Related Parties set forth in Section 7.3(e) and (v)
the rights of Financing Sources and sources of debt financing for the
Transactions set forth in Sections 7.3(e) and 8.7(c) (and, except that
the Financing Sources are hereby made express third-party beneficiaries of
Sections 8.7(a) and (b), 8.8 and 8.9), are not intended to and shall not
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder.

 

SECTION 8.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that State, regardless of the Laws that might
otherwise govern under any applicable conflict of Laws principles.

 

(b) Subject to Section 8.7(c), all actions and proceedings arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined in the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within
the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or
federal court within the State of Delaware) and the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in
any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an
inconvenient forum or lack of jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such
action or proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this
Section 8.7(b) shall not constitute general consents to service of process in
the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as
provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any
Person other than the parties

 



70  hereto. Each party hereto agrees that service of process upon such party in
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
effective if notice is given by overnight courier at the address set forth in
Section 8.10 of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment
in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in the foregoing
shall restrict any partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding,
or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment. 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto hereby agrees
that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing
Source, or any of its Affiliates or Representatives, in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than a court of
competent jurisdiction located within the, Borough of Manhattan in the City
of New York, New York, whether a state or Federal court, and that the
provisions of Section 8.9 relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to
any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim.

SECTION 8.8 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to
take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate this
Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the parties acknowledge and
agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the
courts described in Section 8.7(b) without proof of damages or otherwise,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under
this Agreement, (b) the provisions set forth in Section 7.3 (i) are not
intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would result
from a breach of this Agreement and (ii) shall not be construed to diminish or
otherwise impair in any respect any partys right to specific enforcement and
(c) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor
Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to seek an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing
Parents obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the
Merger (but not the right of the Company to such injunctions,
specific performance or other equitable remedies for obligations other than
with respect to the Equity Financings) shall be subject to the requirements
that (i) the Marketing Period has ended and all conditions in Section 6.1 and
6.2 were satisfied (other than those

 



71  conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at
Closing) at the time when the Closing would have been required to occur but
for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (ii)(a) the Debt
Financing (including any alternative financing that has been obtained in
accordance with, and satisfies the conditions of, Section 5.5(a) of the Merger
Agreement) has been funded in accordance with the terms thereof or will be
funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing and (b) the Rollover Investment is made at
Closing and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if the
Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then it would take such
actions that are within its control to cause the Closing to occur. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other
parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 8.8
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection
with any such order or injunction.

SECTION 8.9 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE
PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

SECTION 8.10 _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered

Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy,
all other terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall
