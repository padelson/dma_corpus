stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or
other similar transaction occurs with respect to the outstanding Shares, or
if a stock dividend is declared by the Company during such period, or a record
date with respect to any such event shall occur during such period, then all
calculations provided for that are based on a number of shares of any class
or series (or trading prices therefor) affected thereby, including the Per
Share Merger Consideration, shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate to
provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event. 

Section 1.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and

with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration,
and shall instead represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, (a) all Dissenting Shares
shall be cancelled, extinguished and cease to exist and (b) the holders of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to
them under the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives,
withdraws or loses such holders right to appraisal under Section 262 of the

fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and
shall be exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 1.8(g)_. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice (and in any event within one Business Day)
of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the fair value
of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands or waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or otherwise comply
with the provisions under Section 262 of the DGCL, or agree or commit to do
any of the foregoing. Any portion of the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration made available to the Paying Agent to pay for Shares that have
become Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

 

Section 1.7 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time:
(a) all Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist in exchange
for the consideration issued pursuant to _Section 1.5_, and all holders of
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights as Company Stockholders except as provided for in
_Section 1.5_ and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
with respect to all Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. No further transfer of any such Shares shall be made on such stock
transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid
certificate previously representing any Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (a " _Company Stock Certificate_ ") is presented to the
Paying Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock
Certificate shall be cancelled and shall be exchanged as provided in _Section
1.8_.

Section 1.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select Computershare Trust
Company, N.A. or another reputable bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") and, in connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the
Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent cash sufficient to make all payments pursuant to _Section
1.5(a)(iii)_. The Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for all expenses
of the Paying Agent. The cash amounts so deposited with the Paying Agent are
referred to collectively as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 

(b) As promptly as practicable (but in no event later than three Business
Days) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Share, in each
case, which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement:

 

(i) a letter of transmittal in customary form, which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Stock
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Stock Certificates
to the Paying Agent, or in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to
the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal; and

 

(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration.

(c) Upon the surrender of Company Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and any other documents reasonably required by the
Paying Agent, with respect to such Company Stock Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, the holder of such Company Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger

 Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Company Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Any Company Stock Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
any surrendered Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered,
it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Company
Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and shall be
accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such
transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer
and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered and shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not required to be paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated hereby, each Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) Until surrendered in accordance with _Section 1.8(c)_, each Company Stock
Certificate and each Book-Entry Share in respect of Shares converted into the
right to receive Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
1.5(a)(iii)_ shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent
only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. The Per Share
Merger Consideration paid and issued upon the surrender of any Company Stock
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with the terms of this Section
1.8 shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such Company Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share
and, in the case of a Company Stock Certificate, the Shares formerly
represented by it.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 1.8_,
if any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by the Surviving Corporation (including if requested by the
Paying Agent), the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, the Paying Agent
(or, if subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to
_Section 1.8(h)_ , Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Stock Certificate, the Per Share Merger Consideration as set
forth in _Section 1.5_.

 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Shares as of the one year anniversary of the Closing Date shall be delivered
to Parent upon demand, and thereafter any holders of Shares who have not
theretofore surrendered their Shares in accordance with this _Section 1.8_
shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for
the Per Share Merger Consideration. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such
holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(g) Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld under the Code or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law or under any other applicable
Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(h) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder
or former holder of Shares or to any other Person with respect to any cash
amounts properly delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property Law, escheat Law or similar Law.

 

Section 1.9 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all
rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors
of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name
of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a
party, and, subject to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, to perform
its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the Transactions,
including the Merger. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, the
performance of the Company of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions, including the Merger, have
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and,
except for obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to adopt or authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions other than the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
pursuant to the DGCL. This Agreement has been validly executed and delivered
by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
each of Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. The Company Board at a
meeting duly called and held has unanimously adopted resolutions that: (i)
determined that each of the Transactions, individually and in the aggregate,
are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,
(ii) approved this Agreement and the Transactions (including the execution,
delivery and performance thereof) and declared it advisable that the Company
enter into this Agreement and consummate the Transactions in accordance with
the DGCL and (iii) recommended that the Companys stockholders adopt this
Agreement (it being understood that nothing in this clause (iii) shall in any
way limit the Company Boards rights under _Section 4.4_).

 

(b) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and
Merger Sub set forth in _Section 3.9(b)_, the Company Board has taken all
appropriate actions so that the restrictions on business combinations
contained in Section 203 of the DGCL will not apply with respect to, or as a
result of, the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of
the Transactions, including the Merger, without any further action on the
part of the Company Stockholders or the Company Board. No other "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or other
anti-takeover statute or Law (each, together with Section 203 of the DGCL, a "
_Takeover Law_ ") is applicable to the Company or the Transactions. None
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has adopted a stockholder rights
agreement, rights plan, "poison pill" or other similar agreement that is
currently in effect.

by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares entitled to
vote thereon in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the Company
Stockholder Meeting (the "Company Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of
the holders of Shares or any other class or series of capital stock of the
Company necessary (under applicable Law, the Companys governing documents or
otherwise) to adopt this Agreement and consummate the Transactions.

performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and the consummation
by the Company of the Transactions does not and will not (i) violate,
contravene or conflict with any provision of the Company Organizational
Documents, (ii) result in any violation or breach of, or constitute any
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or result
in the creation of any Lien (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation, adverse
modification or acceleration of any obligation or a loss of a benefit under,
or require that any Consent be obtained with respect to, any Contract to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any Company

and all filings described in such Section have been made, violate, conflict
with or result in any breach under any provision of any Law applicable to the
Company or Company Assets, except, in the cases of subclauses (ii) and (iii),
where such violation, breach, conflict, default, right of termination or
cancellation, acceleration, loss of benefit or failure to obtain such Consent

has been, in compliance with and not in conflict with, or in default or
violation of, the Laws applicable to each of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including Anti-Corruption Laws, in each case except to the extent that
the failure to comply therewith would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since
December 31, 2015, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has

Authorizations necessary to conduct their respective businesses as

(or involved) management or other employees who have (or had) a significant

 Financing, the " _Financing_ "). As of the Agreement Date, Parent has also
delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of the executed fee
letter associated with the Debt Commitment Letter with the fee amounts,
"market flex" provisions, "securities demand" provisions and other economic

that would (i) reduce the amount of the Debt Financing below the amount
required to satisfy the Financing Uses (after taking into account any
available Equity Financing and available cash of the Company and its
Subsidiaries), (ii) impose any new condition or otherwise adversely amend,
modify or expand any conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing
in an amount required to satisfy the Financing Uses on the Closing Date or
(iii) materially delay or prevent the Closing or make the funding of the Debt
Financing in the amount required to satisfy the Financing Uses (after taking
into account any available Equity Financing and available cash of the Company
and its Subsidiaries) less likely to occur. As of the Agreement Date, (i)
none of the Commitment Letters have been amended, supplemented or modified,
(ii) no such amendment, supplement or modification is contemplated by Parent
or, to the knowledge of Parent, by the other parties thereto (other than
to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other
entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the Agreement
Date) and (iii) the respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letters
have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded and, to the knowledge of
Parent, no such withdrawal, termination or rescission is contemplated. As of
the Agreement Date, except for customary engagement letters and fee credit
letters with respect to the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (none of which (i) reduces the amount of the Debt Financing
below the amount required to satisfy the Financing Uses (after taking into
account any available Equity Financing and available cash of the Company and
its Subsidiaries), (ii) imposes any new condition or otherwise adversely
amends, modifies or expands any conditions precedent to the funding of the
Debt Financing in an amount required to satisfy the Financing Uses on the
Closing Date, (iii) would materially delay or prevent the Closing or (iv)
adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity
Commitment Letter or the Definitive Financing Agreements), there are no side
letters or Contracts to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party related to the
funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing other
than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters delivered to the
Company on or prior to the Agreement Date. As of the Agreement Date, Parent
has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with
the Debt Commitment Letter that are due and payable on or prior to the
Agreement Date pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and Parent
will, directly or indirectly, continue to pay in full any such amounts
required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter as and
when they become due and payable prior to the Closing Date. As of the
Agreement Date, the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and are
the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and Merger
Sub, as the case may be, and, to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other
parties thereto, subject, in each case, to the effect of any Enforceability
Exceptions As of the Agreement Date, there are no conditions precedent related
to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the
Financing required to satisfy the Financing Uses, other than as expressly set
forth in the Commitment Letters. As of the Agreement Date, to the knowledge of
Parent, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would (i) constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger
Sub under any of the Commitment Letters, (ii) constitute a failure to satisfy
a condition on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under the Commitment Letters,
or (iii) assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to the funding or
investing of the Financing on the Closing Date, otherwise result in any
portion of the Financing required to satisfy the Financing Uses being
unavailable on the Closing Date. As of the Agreement Date, assuming the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs
obligations to consummate the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub have no reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters applicable to Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, will not
be satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing required to satisfy the
Financing Uses will not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date.
Assuming the Financing is funded or invested in accordance with the Commitment
Letters, Parent and Merger Sub will have on the Closing Date funds sufficient
to (i) pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, (ii) pay the Payoff
Amount and (iii) satisfy all of the other payment obligations required to be
paid at Closing by Parent and Merger Sub hereunder in connection with the
Transactions (clauses (i) and (ii), the " _Financing Uses_ "). Each of Parent
and Merger Sub affirms that it is not a condition to the Closing that Parent
or Merger Sub obtain financing for the Transactions.

material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, at the time and in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not false or misleading,
in order to correct such information and file an appropriate amendment or

Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry);

(iii) enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent, term sheet,

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
following the Agreement Date and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, in response to a written Acquisition Proposal that did not result
from a breach of the terms of this _Section 4.4_ (a " _Qualifying
Acquisition Proposal_ ") that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that
(i) such Qualifying Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to or result in, a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to
take the actions set forth in clauses (x) and (y) below with respect to such
Qualifying Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, the Company and
the Company Representatives shall be permitted to (x) furnish to the Person
that has made the Qualifying Acquisition Proposal (and such Persons
representatives) information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
and/or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or
other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, in each case pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and (y) engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with
the Person (or such Persons representatives) that has made the Qualifying
Acquisition Proposal.

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) (i) provide
Parent written notice of the receipt by the Company of any Acquisition
Inquiries or Acquisition Proposals and the identity of the party making such
inquiry or proposal ( _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to
disclose the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal if such
disclosure is prohibited by the terms of a confidentiality agreement with such
Person that is in effect on the Agreement Date), (ii) disclose to Parent the
material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, including a copy of all
documents and communications received in connection therewith (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any form of agreement, letter of intent or agreement
in principle in respect of the Acquisition Proposal) and (iii) provide or
make available to Parent copies of all material written information
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries provided or made available
by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Company Representative to such Person
to the extent such written information was not previously provided or made
available to Parent. The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed in all
material respects of any material developments with respect to any such
Acquisition Inquiry or Acquisition Proposal (and any subsequent amendments or
modifications thereto), in each case, as soon as is reasonably practicable and
in any event within 24 hours of receipt, provision or occurrence thereof. The
Company shall, as soon as is reasonably practicable and in any event within
24 hours following a determination by the Company Board that an Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal, notify Parent of such determination.

 

(e) Except as permitted by _Section 4.4(f)_ and _4.4(g)_ , prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) shall not (i) (1) withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify or
publicly propose to withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, (2) fail
to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (3)
recommend the approval or adoption of, or approve or adopt, or publicly

Act within ten Business Days after commencement of such Acquisition Proposal
(actions prohibited by this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Change of
Board Recommendation_ ") or (ii) approve, recommend, authorize, cause, permit,
resolve to allow, or publicly announce an intention to approve or recommend
that, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
Board may, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (x) effect a
Change of Board Recommendation and/or (y) validly terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 6.1(e)_, if (i) the Company receives a Qualifying
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal and
(ii) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that its failure to effect a Change of Board
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1(e)_ would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company Board may not effect a Change of
Board Recommendation pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless:

 

(i) the Company has complied with this _Section 4.4_ with respect to such
Qualifying Acquisition Proposal, other than _de minimis_ breaches;

(ii) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
three Business Days in advance (the " _Superior Proposal Notice Period_ "),
of its intention to effect such a Change of Board Recommendation (which notice
itself shall not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation) or validly
terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of
the Person or group making such Superior Proposal, and shall have
contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed definitive
transaction agreements with the Person making such Superior Proposal;

 

(iii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have negotiated with, and
shall have caused the Company Representatives to negotiate with, Parent in
good faith during the Superior Proposal Notice Period in order to enable
Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement in such a manner that would
eliminate the need for taking such action (and in respect of a Superior
Proposal, would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal);

(iv) following the Companys and the Company Representatives negotiation in
good faith with Parent during the Superior Proposal Notice Period and after
considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any
proposals, amendment or modifications made or agreed to by Parent, if any,
the Company Board (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) shall have determined in good faith, that such Superior
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (it being understood and
agreed that any change to the financial or other material terms of an
Acquisition Proposal that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder
shall require a new notice to Parent as provided above, but with respect to
any such subsequent notices the Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be
deemed to be two Business Days rather than three Business Days); and

(v) in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order to cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company
will have validly terminated (or shall concurrently terminate) this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 6.1(e)_, including paying the Company Termination
Fee in accordance with _Section 6.3(a)(i)_.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may effect a
Change of Board Recommendation if an Intervening Event occurs and the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that its failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company Board may not effect such Change
of Board Recommendation unless:

 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least
three Business Days in advance (the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_ ") of
its intention to effect such a Change of Board Recommendation (which notice
itself shall not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation), which notice
shall specify the details of such Intervening Event and the basis upon which
the Company Board intends to effect a Change of Board Recommendation;

(ii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have negotiated with, and shall
have caused the Company Representatives to negotiate with, Parent in good
faith during the Intervening Event Notice Period in order to enable Parent to
revise the terms of this Agreement so that the failure to make such a Change
of Board Recommendation would no longer be inconsistent with the directors
exercise of their fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholder under
applicable Law; and

 

(iii) following the Companys and the Company Representatives negotiation in
good faith with Parent during the Intervening Event Notice Period and after
considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any
proposals, amendment or modifications made or agreed to by Parent, if any, the
Company Board (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) shall have determined in good faith, that the failure
to make such a Change of Board Recommendation would no longer be inconsistent
with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholder under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any
material changes to the circumstances surrounding the Intervening Event that
was previously the subject of a notice hereunder shall require a new notice to
Parent as provided above, but with respect to any such subsequent notices the
Intervening Event Notice Period shall be deemed to be two Business Days rather
than three Business Days);

 

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from
taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9, Item 1012 of Regulation M-A or otherwise complying
with Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012 under the Exchange Act or from making any
disclosure to the Company Stockholders if the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its failure to
do so would be inconsistent with applicable Law. In addition, none of the
following shall be deemed to be a Change of Board Recommendation: (i) a "stop,
look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (provided that the Company expressly reaffirms
the Company Board Recommendation in such communication), (ii) any statement
that includes an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal or
an express reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation and/or (iii) a
factually accurate public statement that describes the Companys receipt or
review of an Acquisition Proposal, the terms thereof and the identity of the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement
with respect thereto. In addition, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from making any other disclosure to the Company
Stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that is required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the foregoing, nothing in this  _Section 4.4(h)_
shall permit the Company Board to make a Change of Board Recommendation except
to the extent otherwise permitted in this _Section 4.4_.

 

(i) No Change of Board Recommendation shall change the approval of the Company
Board for purposes of causing any Takeover Law to be applicable to the
Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, any
action that may be taken by, and all obligations and duties of, the Company
Board under this _Section 4.4_ may also be taken by and shall bind a
duly constituted committee thereof.

Section 4.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_. 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly obtain any Consents of third parties with respect to any
Company Material Contracts, as may be necessary or appropriate for the
consummation of the Transactions or required by the terms of any such Company
Material Contract as a result of the execution, performance or consummation of
the Transactions, in each case to the extent reasonably requested in writing
by Parent. In the event that such third party Consent described in this
_Section 4.5(a)_ shall not be obtained, the Company and Parent shall
determine reasonably and jointly whether to take any further actions with
respect to such Company Material Contracts; _provided_ that without its
consent (such consent to be given or withheld in its sole discretion), the
Company shall not be required to pay any amount or change Contract terms or
its business practices in order to obtain any such Consent.

(b) Subject to _Section 4.5(c)_ and the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Company and Parent agree, and Parent and the Company each agree
to cause its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make
effective the Transactions and to use their respective reasonable best efforts
to cause the conditions to each Partys obligation to consummate
the Transactions as set forth in _Section 5.1_ to be satisfied as promptly
as practicable (but in no event later than the Outside Date), including taking
all actions necessary (i) to obtain all Governmental Authorizations required
for the consummation of the Merger, (ii) to effect all such necessary
registrations and filings with the Governmental Authorities in order to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other Transactions, (iii) to
comply with all requirements under applicable Law that may be imposed on it
with respect to this Agreement and the Merger and (iv) to avoid a Proceeding
by any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions or to defend or contest any Proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, brought under, pursuant to or relating to any regulatory Law
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions. The
Parties shall cooperate fully with each other to the extent necessary in
connection with the foregoing.

(c) In connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 4.5(b)_ and
without limiting the generality of the undertaking pursuant thereto, Parent
and the Company shall promptly make all filings that may be required for the
satisfaction of the condition set forth in _Section 5.1(c)_ by each of them
in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, which, in any event,
shall be made within 10 Business Days following the Agreement Date with
respect to the initial filings required under the HSR Act (unless a later date
is agreed to in writing by both Parent and the Company). In addition, Parent
and the Company agree, and shall each cause each of its Subsidiaries, to
cooperate and to use their reasonable best efforts and take all actions
necessary to obtain any Governmental Authorizations required for the
consummation of the Merger as contemplated by _Section 4.5(b)_ above as
promptly as possible, including to make all other necessary filings,
notifications or registrations within 15 Business Days of the Agreement Date,
to obtain all Governmental Authorizations, to respond as promptly as
practicable to any requests for information from any Governmental Authority
and otherwise comply with any inquiry or request from any Governmental
Authority as promptly as practicable (and in each case any such information
shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act or
other applicable Antitrust Laws) and to contest and resist any action,
including any legislative, administrative or judicial action and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) (an " _Antitrust Order_ ") that restricts, prevents
or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. Each Party shall
furnish to the other such necessary information and assistance as the other
Party may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of any
necessary filings or submissions by it to any Governmental Authority. Neither
Party shall give Consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline
or withdraw its notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act or any
other filing made pursuant to any Antitrust Law or other regulatory Law
unless the other Party has given its prior written Consent to such extension
or delay (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Parent agrees that neither it, nor any of its Affiliates, will file
a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the Snapfish Transaction Agreement until the
first day following the date on which the condition set forth in _Section
5.1(c)_ is satisfied.

and its applicable Affiliates on all antitrust questions prior to the
Closing, including by (i) cooperating with outside antitrust counsel for
Parent and its applicable Affiliates, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to
honor requests by Parent and its applicable Affiliates to provide the
production of materials and access to employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for interviews and attendance at meetings with the antitrust
agencies and (iii) responding on a timely basis to all requests by the
antitrust agencies for the production of materials, interviews, and
interrogatories prior to the Closing.

(e) Parent and the Company will consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and
provide to the other in advance (to the extent legally permissible), any
analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals
made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in connection with Proceedings
under or relating to any Antitrust Laws. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions, the
Parties agree to (i) give each other reasonable advance notice of all meetings
with any Governmental Authority relating to any Antitrust Laws, (ii) give each
other an opportunity to participate in each of such meetings, (iii) give each
other reasonable advance notice of all substantive oral communications with
any Governmental Authority relating to any Antitrust Laws, (iv) if any
Governmental Authority initiates a substantive oral communication regarding
any Antitrust Laws, to promptly notify the other Party of the substance of
such communication, (v) provide each other with a reasonable advance
opportunity to review and comment upon all written communications (including
any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals) with a Governmental Authority regarding any Antitrust Laws and (vi)
provide each other with copies of all written communications from any
Governmental Authority relating to any Antitrust Laws. Any disclosures or
provision of copies by one Party to the other may be made on an outside
counsel basis, if appropriate. Except as prohibited or restricted by
applicable Law, each Party or its attorneys shall provide the other Party or
its attorneys the opportunity to make copies of all correspondence, filings or
communications (or memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between such
Party or its representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority,
on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions.

(f) Each of Parent and the Company shall notify and keep the other advised as
to (i) any material communication from any Governmental Authority regarding
any of the Transactions and (ii) any litigation or administrative Proceeding
pending and known to such Party, or to its knowledge threatened,
that challenges, or would challenge, the Transactions. The Company and Parent
shall not take any action inconsistent with their obligations under this
Agreement.

 

(g) If any objections are asserted with respect to the Transactions under any
Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted or threatened by any Governmental
Authority or any private party challenging any of the Transactions as
violating any Antitrust Law or if a filing pursuant to _Section 4.5(b)_ is
reasonably likely to be rejected or conditioned by a Governmental Authority,
then each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve
such objections or challenges as such Governmental Authority or other Person
may have to such transactions so as to permit consummation of the Transactions
as soon as practicable and in any event prior to the Outside Date. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, use its and their reasonable best efforts, and
promptly take any and all steps necessary, to avoid or eliminate any concerns
on the part of, or to satisfy any conditions imposed by, any Governmental
Authority under any Antitrust Law or any other Person so as to enable the
Parties to consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any
event prior to the Outside Date, including (i) proposing, negotiating,
offering to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, committing to
and effecting), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the
sale,

 divestiture, license or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent
or its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, now owned or hereafter sought to be
acquired, (ii) terminating or amending any existing relationships and
contractual rights and obligations and (iii) otherwise offering to take or
offering to commit to take any action which it is capable of taking, and if
the offer is accepted, taking or committing to take, such actions as are
necessary, whether or not such actions limit or modify Parents rights of
ownership in, or ability to conduct the business of, one or more of its
operations, divisions, businesses, product lines, customers or assets,
including, after the Closing, the business of the Company, in each case as if
it is determined that such action is necessary in order to obtain all
Governmental Authorizations necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth in
_Section 5.1(b)_ and  _Section 5.1(c)_ prior to the Outside Date and/or to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Antitrust Order which
would have the effect of preventing or delaying the consummation of the Merger
and the other Transactions beyond the Outside Date. In connection therewith,
Parent shall take any and all actions necessary in order to ensure that (x) no
requirement for a Consent of the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice, any State Attorney General or other
Governmental Authority, (y) no Order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) in any suit or Proceeding and (z) no other matter relating to any
Antitrust Law, would preclude consummation of the Merger prior to the Outside
Date. In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent shall (A) keep the Company
informed of all matters, discussions and activities relating to any of the
matters contemplated by this _Section 4.5(g)_, (B) provide the Company with
a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon (which reasonable
comments Parent shall consider in good faith) the content of, any filings with
or presentations or submissions to any Governmental Authority relating
to this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby, and give the
Company the opportunity to participate in the strategic planning for any
meetings with, and the negotiations with, Governmental Authorities relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing
to the contrary, except as otherwise set forth in _Section 4.5(g)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, in no event shall (A) the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries be required or expected to pay any amount or incur additional
costs or expenses in order to obtain any such Governmental consent or (B) any
Party be obligated to undertake or agree to undertake any sale, divestiture,
disposition or other remedial measure pursuant to this _Section 4.5(g)_ that
(I) is not contingent on the consummation of the Merger or (II) that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably expected to be materially
detrimental to the benefits to be derived by Parent as a result of the
Merger.

(h) During the Pre-Closing Period, except as required by this Agreement,
Parent and its Affiliates shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, engage in any action or enter into any transaction or permit any
action to be taken or transaction to be entered into by Parent or any of
its Affiliates, that would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of
Parent, its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates shall, and shall not
cause any Person to, enter into or consummate any transaction, agreement,
arrangement, or acquisition of any ownership interest or assets of any Person,
the effect of which would reasonably be expected to impair, materially delay
or prevent any required approvals, or expiration of the waiting period, under
the HSR Act, or require any approvals or filings under any other Antitrust
Laws.

(i) No action by the Company taken in compliance with _Section 4.4_ will be
considered a violation of this _Section  4.5_.

Section 4.6 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company will consult with
each other and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon
any press release or public announcement relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions, and shall not, and shall not permit their Affiliates to, issue
any such press release or public announcement without the prior written
consent of the other Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) except where such disclosure is required by applicable
Law, by

 obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or as may be requested by a Governmental Authority, as determined in
good faith by the Party making such public announcement or issuing such press
release. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that the initial press
release announcing the Transactions and the execution and delivery of this
Agreement shall be a joint press release in the form heretofore agreed to by
the Company and Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 4.6_, (i) each of the Parties and their Affiliates may issue press
releases or public announcements concerning the Transactions that
are consistent with previous press releases or public announcements made by
Parent or the Company in compliance with this _Section 4.6_, (ii) each of the
Parties, their Affiliates, the Company Representatives and the
Parent Representatives may make public statements in response to specific
questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry
conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such
statements are consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made by Parent or the Company in compliance with this
_Section 4.6_ and do not reveal material, non-public information regarding
the other parties, the Merger or the other Transactions, (iii) the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 4.6_ shall not apply to any press
release or public announcement issued or proposed to be issued in connection
with, or in response to, an Acquisition Proposal, Intervening Event, Superior
Proposal or a Change of Board Recommendation that does not violate _Section
4.4_, (iv) each of the Parties and their Affiliates may issue press releases
or public announcements concerning the Transactions in connection with a
dispute between the Parties regarding this Agreement or the Transactions and
(v) Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates, without consulting
with the Company, may provide ordinary course communications regarding this
Agreement and the Transactions to existing or prospective general and limited
partners, equity holders, members, managers and investors of any Affiliates of
such Person, in each case, who are subject to customary confidentiality
restrictions.

Section 4.7 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which any director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Company
Employees_ ") will participate effective as of or after the Effective Time
(collectively, " _New Plans_ "), subject to applicable Law and applicable Tax
qualification requirements, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, recognize all service of the Company Employees with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is reflected in the books and records
of the Company, as the case may be, for vesting, eligibility and level of
benefits purposes (but not for accrual purposes, except for vacation and
severance) in any New Plan in which such Company Employees will be eligible
to participate after the Effective Time, in each case except to the extent
that recognizing such service would result in a duplication of benefits. To
the extent any Company Employee participates in a New Plan that is a welfare
plan or arrangement of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the
Closing Date (a " _Parent Welfare Plan_ "), Parent and any of its Subsidiaries
will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and any insurer or service
provider under the applicable Parent Welfare Plan, cause all (i) pre-existing
condition limitations which otherwise would be applicable to such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents to be waived to the extent
satisfied under a Company Benefit Plan comparable to such Parent Welfare Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date or, if later, immediately prior to such
Company Employees commencement of participation in such Parent Welfare
Plan, (ii) participation waiting periods under each Parent Welfare Plan that
would otherwise be applicable to such Company Employee to be waived to the
same extent waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan comparable to
such Parent Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date or, if later,
immediately prior to such Company Employees commencement of participation in
such Parent Welfare Plan and (iii) co-payments and deductibles paid by
Company Employees in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs to be
credited for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out of pocket
requirement under any such Parent Welfare Plan.

(b) For any Company Employee that remains an employee of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates,
following the Effective Time (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ "):

 

(i) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, for a period
of 12 months following the Effective Time, provide for (i) base salary or
base hourly wage, if applicable, that is no less favorable than that provided
to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
cash incentive compensation opportunities including with respect to
individual target bonus levels (but excluding, equity-based awards, or any
change in control or retention bonuses) no less favorable than to those
provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (iii) employee benefits (other than equity-based awards, change in
control or retention bonuses, and defined benefit or non-qualified
arrangements) that are no less favorable in the aggregate, to the employee
benefits provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (iv) upon a termination without Cause of a Continuing
Employee, severance benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate to
the benefits that would have been provided to each such Continuing Employee
under the applicable Company severance benefit plans or individual agreements
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or otherwise pursuant to
the Companys customary severance practices as described in _Section 4.7(b)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter. Without limiting the foregoing clause (iv),
at all times after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide each Continuing Employee who experiences a
termination of employment and who would receive severance or acceleration
benefits under his or her Contracts with the Company that are disclosed in 
_Section 4.7(b)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter to receive severance and
acceleration benefits no less favorable than those set forth in such
Contracts.

 

(ii) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to assume, honor and continue the Company Benefit Plans
in accordance with their terms, as in effect as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Furthermore, Parent acknowledges that, as of the Effective
Time, a "change in control" (or "change of control" or similar defined term,
as applicable) shall have occurred for purposes of each Company Benefit Plan
in which such definition appears. Nothing in this Section shall limit the
ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to amend,
modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms, as
in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Indemnified Person otherwise consents thereto and (v) the Surviving
Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Person in the

respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses of

and effect and continue to honor the obligations thereunder for a period of

and customary representations and warranties to applicable insurance carriers

of expenses under this Agreement or otherwise, upon learning of any
Proceeding that is subject to the indemnification obligations of this _Section
4.8_, shall promptly notify the Surviving Corporation thereof, but failure to
so notify shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation of an Liability it may
have to such Indemnified Person, except to the extent such failure prejudices
in any material respect the Surviving Corporation.

foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Debt Financing in an amount
required to satisfy the Financing Uses (after taking into account any

Commitment Letter (other than to increase the amount of Equity Financing
available thereunder) without the prior written consent of the Company or (ii)
the Debt Commitment Letter, without the prior written consent of the Company,

waiver would (A) impose new or additional conditions precedent to the funding
of the Debt Financing in an amount required to satisfy the Financing Uses

representations in this Agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub that speak as
of the Agreement Date), references to (i) the "Equity Financing", "Debt
Financing" and "Financing" will include the financing contemplated by the

or other modification or waiver.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this _Section 4.16_ will require, and in no event will
the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to
require, either Parent or Merger Sub to (i) seek the Equity Financing from any
source other than a counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that
contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter or (ii) pay any fees in excess
of those contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment

Business Days) after the execution thereof, Parent shall provide copies
of all executed Definitive Financing Agreements to the Company. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall give the Company prompt
written notice after Parents knowledge (i) of any default or breach (or any
event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would, or would
reasonably be expected to, give rise to any default or breach) by any party
under any of the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements of
which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, (ii) of any termination of any of
the Commitment Letters, (iii) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub or their
respective Affiliates of any written notice or other written communication
from any Financing Source with respect to any (A) actual or potential
default, breach, termination or repudiation of any Commitment Letter or any
Definitive Financing Agreement, or any material provision thereof, in each
case by any party thereto, or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or
among any parties to any Commitment Letter or the Definitive Financing
Agreements that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
the Closing or make the funding of the Financing required to satisfy the
Financing Uses on the Closing Date less likely to occur and (iv) of the
occurrence of an event or development that could reasonably be expected to
adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain all or any
portion of the Financing necessary to satisfy the Financing Uses (after
taking into account any available Equity Financing and available cash of the
Company and its Subsidiaries).

assistance that would be required or expected to be required in connection
with the Debt Commitment Letter in effect on the date of this Agreement and

(c) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts, and will cause each of
its Subsidiaries to use its respective reasonable best efforts, to
periodically update any Required Financial Information provided to Parent and
the Debt Financing Sources as may be necessary so that such Required Financial
Information (i) is Compliant, (ii) meets the applicable requirements set
forth in the definition of "Required Financial Information" and (iii) would
not, after giving effect to such update(s), cause the Marketing Period to

Company and its Subsidiaries under this  _Section 4.17_ at any time, and

the Closing Date; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Marketing
Period shall not be applicable to each attempt to access the market. The

thereof, Form 8-K (provided that the Company shall not be deemed to be
in breach of this clause (i) if such forms are filed within the time periods
required under Rule 12b-25 under the Exchange Act) and (ii) use reasonable
best efforts to file all other Forms 8-K, in each case, required to be filed
with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act prior to the Closing Date in

disclosure related to the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter, Parent reasonably requests the Company to file a Current Report on
Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act that contains material non-public
information with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or their
securities, which information Parent reasonably determines (and the Company
does not reasonably object) to include in an offering memorandum or other
marketing materials for the Debt Financing, then the Company shall file such
Current Report on Form 8-K, it being understood that an objection by the
Company shall be deemed to be reasonable if such information relates to an
Acquisition Inquiry or an Acquisition Proposal.

 

(d) Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Company, its
Subsidiaries, their Affiliates and the Company Representatives from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in
connection with their cooperation in arranging the Debt Financing and the
performance of their respective obligations under this _Section 4.17_ and
the provision of any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
information provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries), in each case, other
than to the extent any of the foregoing was suffered or incurred as a result
of the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or material
breach of this Agreement by, the Company and its Subsidiaries or the Company
Representatives. Parent shall, promptly upon request of the Company, promptly
reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all out-of-pocket fees, costs
and expenses incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries (including those of
its Affiliates and the Company Representatives) in connection with the
cooperation required by this _Section 4.17_.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Parent acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby are not contingent upon Parent

than fifteen (15) days prior to the commencement of the Marketing Period, to
the extent that any Company Registered IP is not in the current legal name of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or is otherwise subject to a chain of title
defect, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts, and shall cause its
applicable Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts, to prepare, execute,
file and record all instruments and documents necessary to cure such title
defects and provide for current ownership by the Company or its Subsidiaries
in such Company Registered IP, with such actions subject to Parents
reasonable approval.

 foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount
would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, (iii) the Parent
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Company in the circumstances in which such fee
is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and (iv) that, without
these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if (x) the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this _Section 6.3_ , and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences
a Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for any amount
due pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ , then the Company shall pay Parent its
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such Proceeding
not to exceed $500,000 (the " _Expense Cap_ ") or (y) Parent fails to timely
pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ , and, in order to obtain

date of payment at the annual rate of two percent (2%) plus the prime lending
rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made (or such lesser rate as is the maximum
permitted by applicable Law). All payments under this _Section 6.3_ shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
in writing by Parent or the Company, as applicable, such written instruction
to be provided promptly after such payment becomes due and payable under this
_Section 6.3_. In no event shall a Company Termination Fee or Parent
Termination Fee be payable more than once.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, subject to

circumstances where the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses is
payable pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ , the payment of the Company
Termination Fee, the Parent Expenses and, if applicable, the cost of expenses
of Parent pursuant to _Section 6.3(d)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of
their respective former, current or future stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates or Representatives (the " _Company Related Parties_ ")
or the Debt Financing Source Related Parties for all Liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or
for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of
such amount, none of the Company Related Parties or the Debt Financing
Source Related Parties shall have any further Liability relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, in each case subject to
_Section 6.2_ and (ii) in the event that this Agreement is terminated under
circumstances where the Parent Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this
_Section 6.2_, the payment of the Parent Termination Fee and, if applicable,
the cost of expenses of the Company pursuant to _Section 6.3(d)_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries against the
Parent Related Parties or the Debt Financing Source Related Parties for all
Liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered as a result of the failure of the
Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder
or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Parent Related
Parties or the Debt Financing Source Related Parties shall have any further
Liability relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any Transaction
Document or any other agreement referenced herein or otherwise, under no
circumstances may the Company receive both (i) an award of monetary damages,
on the one hand and (ii) any of the Parent Termination Fee and/or any of the
amounts, if any, as and when due, pursuant to this Agreement, on the other
hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 6.3(e)_, and the payment
of the Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses, will not relieve the
Company from liability for any fraud or willful breach.

Section 7.4 _Severability_.

 

Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in
any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of

 replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does
not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the Parties agree
to negotiate in good faith to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to
the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid
or unenforceable term.

 

Section 7.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the exhibits
hereto and the Company Disclosure Letter), the Equity Commitment Letter, the
Limited Guarantee and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement of the Parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and, except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies hereunder.

 

Section 7.6 _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall not
be assigned by any Party without the prior written consent of the other
Parties, and any attempted assignment, without such consent, shall be null and
void; _provided_ that each of Parent and Merger Sub shall have the
right, without the prior written consent of the Company, to assign all or any
portion of their respective rights, interests and obligations hereunder to a
wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent or to any of their
respective Affiliates, or to any debt financing sources (including the Debt
Financing sources) for purposes of creating a security interest herein or
otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of any debt financing (including
the Debt Financing), but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger
Sub of any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each Party and their respective permitted
successors and permitted assigns and nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,

Agreement, except (a) from and after the Closing, as set forth in _Section
4.8_ (Indemnification of Directors and Officers), (b) from and after the
Closing, (i) the rights of the holders of Shares to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration to which they are entitled to receive in accordance
with  _Section 1.5(a)(iii)_ and (ii) the rights of the holders of the
Company Options, the Company RSUs, the Company PSUs and the Company MSUs to
receive such amounts as provided for in _Section 1.5(a)(iv)_ through 
_Section 1.5(a)(vii)_, as applicable, (c) as provided in _Section 6.2_,
_Section 6.3_, _Section 7.7_, _Section 7.15_ and _Section 7.16_, and (d)
this _Section 7.6_ in respect of clauses (b) and (c).

Section 7.7 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damage. It
is accordingly agreed that, subject to _Section 7.7(b)_, prior to any valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 6.1_, (i) each
Party (on behalf of itself or any third-party beneficiary to this Agreement)
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity and (ii) the Parties shall waive, in any
Proceeding for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at
law. Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other Person shall
be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in

 connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in
this _Section 7.7_, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have
to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument. Subject to _Section 7.7(b)_, the Parties agree not to raise any
objections to (i) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on
the other hand and (ii) the specific performance of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent
and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement. A Partys pursuit of specific
performance at any time shall not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver
of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such Party may be
entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for Liabilities or damages
incurred or suffered by such Party in the case of a breach of this Agreement
involving fraud or willful breach, in each case, subject to the terms,
conditions and limitations set forth in this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 7.7(a)_ or anything in any Transaction
Document or otherwise to the contrary, and subject in all respects to this
_Section 7.7(b)_, in no event shall the Company or any Affiliate or
stockholder thereof (or any of the foregoings respective representatives) be
entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents or Merger Subs
obligation to cause all or any portion of the Equity Financing to be funded
(whether under this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter) or otherwise
cause Parent or Merger Sub to take action to consummate the Merger or the
other Transactions or any other Transaction Document or otherwise (including
the obligation to pay all or any portion of the Per Share Merger
Consideration) unless and only if: (i) all of the conditions set forth in
_Section 5.1_ and _Section 5.2_ have been and continue to be satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions
at the Closing), (ii) the Debt Financing has been (or will concurrently be)
received by Parent in full in accordance with the terms thereof, or the
Debt Financing Sources have irrevocably confirmed in writing to the Parties
that the Debt Financing will be funded in full at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing ( _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub
shall not be required to draw down the Equity Commitment Letter or consummate
the Closing if the Debt Commitment Letter are not in fact funded at the
Closing), (iii) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to complete the Closing by
the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.3_,
(iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that (A) if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing
are funded, then the Closing will occur substantially simultaneously with the
drawdown of the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing (and the Company has
not revoked, withdrawn, modified or conditioned such confirmation) and (B) the
Company is prepared, willing and able to effect the Closing and the other
Transactions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (v) Parent and
Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing within three Business Days after
delivery of the Companys irrevocable written confirmation; _ provided_,
that the Company remains ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing
during such three Business Day period. Notwithstanding anything else to the
contrary in any Transaction Document or otherwise, for the avoidance of
doubt, while the Company may, subject in all respects to _Section 6.2_,
_Section 6.3_, this _Section 7.7(b)_ and _Section 7.16_ (including, in each
case, the limitations set forth therein), concurrently seek (x) specific
performance or other equitable relief, subject in all respects to this
_Section 7.7(b)_, and (y) payment of the Parent Termination Fee, if, as and
when required pursuant to  _Section 6.3(b)_, under no circumstances shall
the Company, directly or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive (1)
both a grant of specific performance to cause the Equity Financing to be
funded (whether under this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter) or
other equitable relief, on the one hand, and/or the payment of all or any
portion of the Parent Termination Fee and/or any amount, if any, as and when
due, pursuant to _Section 6.3(d)_, on the other hand, or (2) both payment of
any monetary damages whatsoever, on the one hand, and payment of any of the
Parent Termination Fee and/or any amount, if any, as and when due, pursuant to
_Section 6.3(d)_, on the other hand.
