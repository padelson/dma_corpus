with the Debt Commitment Letter with the fee amounts, &#147;market flex&#148; provisions, &#147;securities demand&#148; provisions and other economic terms redacted in a customary manner, none of which redactions covers terms that would
(i)&nbsp;reduce the amount of the Debt Financing below the amount required to satisfy the Financing Uses (after taking into account any available Equity Financing and available cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries), (ii)&nbsp;impose any new
condition or otherwise adversely amend, modify or expand any conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing in an amount required to satisfy the Financing Uses on the Closing Date or (iii)&nbsp;materially delay or prevent the Closing or
make the funding of the Debt Financing in the amount required to satisfy the Financing Uses (after taking into account any available Equity Financing and available cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries) less likely to occur. As of the Agreement
Date, (i)&nbsp;none of the Commitment Letters have been amended, supplemented or modified, (ii)&nbsp;no such amendment, supplement or modification is contemplated by Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, by the other parties thereto (other than to
add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the Agreement Date) and (iii)&nbsp;the respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have not been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded and, to the knowledge of Parent, no such withdrawal, termination or rescission is contemplated. As of the Agreement Date, except for customary engagement letters and fee credit letters with respect to the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (none of which (i)&nbsp;reduces the amount of the Debt Financing below the amount required to satisfy the Financing Uses (after taking into account any available Equity Financing and available

the Closing Date, (iii)&nbsp;would materially delay or prevent the Closing or (iv)&nbsp;adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment
Letter or the Definitive Financing Agreements), there are no side letters or Contracts to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing other than as expressly set forth
in the Commitment Letters delivered to the Company on or prior to the Agreement Date. As of the Agreement Date, Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter that are due and payable on
or prior to the Agreement Date pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and Parent will, directly or indirectly, continue to pay in full any such amounts required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter as and when
they become due and payable prior to the Closing Date. As of the Agreement Date, the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and are the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, and, to
the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, subject, in each case, to the effect of any Enforceability Exceptions As of the Agreement Date, there are no conditions precedent related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the
full amount of the Financing required to satisfy the Financing Uses, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters. As of the Agreement Date, to the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would (i)&nbsp;constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under any of the Commitment Letters, (ii)&nbsp;constitute a failure to satisfy a condition on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under the Commitment
Letters, or (iii)&nbsp;assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to the funding or investing of the Financing on the Closing Date, otherwise result in any portion of the Financing required to satisfy the Financing Uses being unavailable on the
Closing Date. As of the Agreement Date, assuming the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parent&#146;s and Merger Sub&#146;s obligations to consummate the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub have no reason to believe that any of the conditions to
the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters applicable to Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, will not be satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing required to satisfy the Financing Uses will not be made available to Parent on the
Closing Date. Assuming the Financing is funded or invested in accordance with the Commitment Letters, Parent and Merger Sub will have on the Closing Date funds sufficient to (i)&nbsp;pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, (ii)&nbsp;pay
the Payoff Amount and (iii)&nbsp;satisfy all of the other payment obligations required to be paid at Closing by Parent and Merger Sub hereunder in connection with the Transactions (clauses (i)&nbsp;and (ii), the &#147;<B><I>Financing
Uses</I></B>&#148;). Each of Parent and Merger Sub affirms that it is not a condition to the Closing that Parent or Merger Sub obtain financing for the Transactions. </P>
