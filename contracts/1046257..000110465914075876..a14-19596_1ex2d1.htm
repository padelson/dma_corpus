NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 **THE MERGER**

 



 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the WBCA, at the Effective Time, the Company and Merger
Sub shall consummate the Merger pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the

      
 

 



 

Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon
cease, (ii) the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger and
shall continue to be governed by the WBCA and (iii) the separate corporate
existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The corporation
surviving the Merger is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving
Corporation_." The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section
23B.11.100 of the WBCA.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Company shall
be amended in their entirety to read as set forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto and
shall thereafter be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.
At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 1.2 _Effective Time_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause
articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") to be duly executed and
filed in accordance with the WBCA on the Closing Date (or on such other date
as Parent and the Company may agree) with the Secretary of State of the State
of Washington and shall make all other filings or recordings required under
the WBCA. This Agreement together with _Exhibit B_ hereto, but excluding the
other exhibits and schedules to this Agreement shall be deemed the "plan of
merger" under Chapter 11 of the WBCA and shall be filed with the Articles of
Merger pursuant to Section 23B.11.050(1) of the WBCA. The Merger shall become
effective at the time such Articles of Merger shall have been duly filed with,
and accepted by, the Secretary of State of the State of Washington or such
later date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the
Articles of Merger, such date and time hereinafter referred to as the "
_Effective Time_."

 



 

Section 1.3 _Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take
place at 10:00 a.m., Chicago time, on a date to be specified by the parties,
such date to be no later than the fifth Business Day after satisfaction or
waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than
conditions that may only be satisfied on the Closing Date, but subject to the
satisfaction of such conditions), by electronic exchange of documents and
signatures, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to
herein as the " _Closing Date_."

 



 

Section 1.4 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors and officers of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors shall
have been duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving CorporationÂ’s
articles of incorporation and bylaws and applicable Laws.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 **MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OF STOCK**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Company Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or Merger
Sub or any holder of any securities thereof:

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub,
par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, par
value $0.01 per share.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each outstanding or issued Share that is owned
by Parent or Merger Sub, or by any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub,
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_
"), shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no cash,
stock or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares)
shall automatically be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount,
without interest, equal to the Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time,
all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry Shares ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares, except, in all cases, the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest, upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with _Section 2.2_. The right of any holder of any Share to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount
of any withholding that is required under applicable Tax Law.

 



 

(d) _Company Stock Awards_. The Company shall take all requisite action so
that at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares ("
_Company Stock Options_ ") under any stock option plan of the Company,
including the Penford Corporation 1994 Stock Option Plan, the Penford
Corporation 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, and any other plan,
agreement or arrangement of the Company (collectively, the " _Company Equity
Plans_ "), shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any
such cancelled Company Stock Option shall be entitled to receive, in
consideration of the cancellation of such Company Stock Option and in
settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of
(i) the total number of Shares subject to such cancelled Company Stock Option
and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the
exercise price per Share subject to such cancelled Company Stock Option,
without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the " _Option Payments_ ");
provided, however, that (i) any such Company Stock Option with respect to
which the exercise price per Share subject thereto is equal to or greater than
the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled in exchange for no consideration
and (ii) such Option Payments may be reduced by the amount of any required Tax
withholdings as provided by this Agreement. The Option Payments shall be paid
out in accordance with _Section 2.2_. From and

 



      
 

 



 

after the Effective Time, no Company Stock Option shall be exercisable, and
each Company Stock Option shall only entitle the holder thereof to the payment
provided for in this _Section 2.1(d)_.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the number of outstanding
Shares shall have been changed into a different number of Shares or a
different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or
stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said
period, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide
the holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event
shall the aggregate amount payable by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.2_ after
giving effect to any such event exceed the amount that would have been payable
pursuant to _Section 2.2_ had such event not occurred and (ii) nothing in
this _Section 2.1_ shall permit the Company to take any action with respect
to its securities that is expressly prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Disposition of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to the
CompanyÂ’s shareholders, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company to act as
Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration. Parent will enter into a paying agent agreement with the Paying
Agent (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ ") on terms reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Company, prior to the Effective Time. Immediately following the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent for payment in
accordance with _Section 2.1_ the aggregate Merger Consideration, (such total
deposited cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The
Paying Agent shall make, and Parent shall direct the Paying Agent to make,
payments of the Merger Consideration, out of the Payment Fund in accordance
with this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and the Paying Agent Agreement.
The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



 

(b) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
representing ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such Shares except
as otherwise provided for herein. From and after the Effective Time, any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Paying Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation for any reason (other than Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares representing Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Article II_.

 



 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. As soon as possible after the Effective Time (but in
no event later than three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (other than
Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) (A) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that

 



      
 

 



 

delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to
the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to which the
holder thereof is entitled. Upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount
of Merger Consideration payable in cash in respect of the Shares previously
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_, to be paid within three (3) Business Days
(or such longer period required by the Paying Agent) of the Paying AgentÂ’s
receipt of such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Shares, the duly executed and completed letter of transmittal and any
other documents as reasonably required by the Paying Agent, and the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be
paid or accrue on any cash payable pursuant to this _Section 2.2_.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund which
remains undistributed for nine months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, and any holders of Shares prior to the Effective Time who
have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ and the instructions in
the letter of transmittal shall thereafter look only to Parent and only as
general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws).

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company or the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent,
representative or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect
of the Merger Consideration from the Payment Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

 



 

(f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund as directed by the Surviving Corporation. Any net
profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments
shall be payable to Parent. To the extent that there are losses with respect
to such investments, or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below
the level required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as
contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of
the Payment Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that
the Payment Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make
such payments.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by Parent
or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
and customary amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, pursuant to
this Agreement.

 



 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. Such withheld amounts shall be properly remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Entity.

 



 

(i) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall not be
converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, unless and until such shareholder shall have failed to perfect,
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such shareholderÂ’s rights to
appraisal under the WBCA. Such holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
to receive such consideration as is determined to be due with respect to such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under the Appraisal Rights,
then the right of such holder to be paid such consideration as is determined
to be due pursuant to Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA shall cease and such
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive,
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares held by such
shareholder, without interest and reduced by the amount of any withholding
that is required under applicable Tax Law. The Company shall promptly deliver
to Parent notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any
Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall

looking statements" disclaimer or any other disclosure of risks or any other
statements that are predictive or forward-looking in nature); _provided_ ,

operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now being

Material Adverse Effect.

the shareholders or other equity holders of the Acquired Companies may vote ("
_Company Voting Debt_ ").

 



 

(c) As of the date hereof, 1,429,000 Shares are subject to issuance pursuant

granted). Each Company Stock Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock
option" under Section 422 of the Code, if any, so qualifies. Each Company

all equity plans pursuant to which the Company has granted Company Stock
Options or Restricted Shares and the forms of all award agreements evidencing

Company and its Subsidiaries (including any guarantee of any indebtedness of
borrowed money of any Person).

 



 

Section 3.3 _Authority_.

 



 

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and, subject, in the case of the Merger, to the
approval of this Agreement by the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding Shares entitled to vote thereon (the " _Company Shareholder
Approval_ "), to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Voting
Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to approve this Agreement
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, subject, in the case of
the consummation of the Merger, to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval
and to the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Washington as required by the WBCA. Each of this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the

 



      
 

 



 

counterparties thereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms
(except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditorsÂ’ rights generally or by general principles of
equity).

 



 

(b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has unanimously
adopted resolutions (i) determining that this Agreement, the Voting Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are
advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders (the "
_Company Determination_ "), (ii) approving and adopting this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement and approving the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, (iii) directing that the approval of this
Agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the shareholders of the
Company and (iv) recommending that the CompanyÂ’s shareholders approve this
Agreement (the " _Company Recommendation_ "), which resolutions have not been
rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way except, if applicable, to the
extent permitted by _Section 5.3_. The approval referred to in clause (ii) of
this _Section 3.3(b)_ constituted approval under the provisions of Chapter
23B.19 of the WBCA, to the extent applicable, as a result of which this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger), are not and will not be subject to the restrictions on significant
business transactions under the provisions of Chapter 23B.19 of the WBCA. The
Company Shareholder Approval is the only vote of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock or other securities of the Company required under
applicable Law, Contract or otherwise to approve the transactions contemplated
hereby. The affirmative vote of the holders of outstanding Shares or of any
other securities of the Company is not necessary to consummate any transaction
contemplated hereby other than the Merger.

 



 

Section 3.4 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

 



 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company,
and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby,

Documents, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals and authorizations
contemplated by _clauses (i)_ through _(iv)_ of subsection (b) below have
been obtained and all filings described in such clauses have been made,
conflict with or violate any statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation, order,
judgment or decree (collectively, " _Law_ ") or any settlement, injunction or
award of any Governmental Entity, in each case that is applicable to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective assets
or properties are bound, (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default), or result in a right of required payment or loss of a
benefit under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation,
amendment or acceleration of, any Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective assets or properties are bound, (iv) result in any
breach or violation of any Company Plan (including any award agreement
thereunder), or (v) result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
material properties or assets of the Acquired Companies (or of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time), except, in the case of
_clauses (ii)_ , _(iii)_ (other than with respect to Contracts of the nature
described in _Section 3.15(a)(v)_ or _(vii)_ ) and _(iv)_ of this paragraph,
for any such

 



       
 

 



 

conflict, breach, violation, default, loss, right or other occurrence that
individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company,
and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby,
do not and will not require any consent, approval, order, license,
authorization or permit of, action by, filing, registration or declaration
with or notification to, any governmental or regulatory (including stock
exchange) authority, agency, court, commission or other governmental body
(each, a " _Governmental Entity_ "), except for (i) such filings as required

thereunder) and under state securities and "blue sky" Laws, (ii) the filings
required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as

with the Secretary of State of the State of Washington of the Articles of

its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business and (v) those other consents,
approvals, orders, licenses, authorizations or permits of, actions by,
filings, registrations or declarations with or notifications that if not made
or obtained, as applicable, would not be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

Section 3.5 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The Company has filed or furnished all forms, reports, statements,
schedules, certifications and other documents (including all exhibits,
amendments and supplements thereto) required to be filed or furnished by it
with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ")
since January 1, 2011 (all such forms, reports, statements, schedules,
certificates and other documents, collectively, the " _Company SEC Documents_
"). As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of the last
such amendment filed prior to the date hereof, each of the Company SEC
Documents complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_
"), the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes Â— Oxley Act of 2002 (" _SOX_ "), and the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as the case may be,
each as in effect on the date so filed, and did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, unless such information contained in any Company SEC Document
has been corrected by a later-filed Company SEC Document that was filed prior
to the date hereof. No Subsidiary of the Company is subject to the periodic
reporting requirements of the Exchange Act or is or has been otherwise
required to file any form, report, statement, schedule, certificate or other
document with the SEC, any foreign Governmental Entity that performs a similar
function to that of the SEC or any securities exchange or quotation system.

 



      
 

 



 

(b)

 



 

(i) The audited consolidated financial statements of the Company (including
any related notes thereto) that are included in the Company SEC Documents (A)
comply as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC applicable thereto, (B) have been prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and (C) fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations, cash flows and shareholdersÂ’ equity for the periods
indicated. The unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company
(including any related notes thereto) that are included in the Company SEC
Documents (x) comply as to form in all material respects with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto, (y) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or may be permitted
by the SEC under the Exchange Act) and (z) fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations, cash flows and shareholdersÂ’ equity for the periods
indicated.

 



 

(ii) The unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company (including
any related notes thereto) delivered to Parent prior to the date hereof for
the fiscal year ended August 31, 2014 (the " _2014 Year-End Draft Financial
Statements_ ") (x) comply as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto except for the
absence of notes, which notes, if included, would not contain any material
inconsistency, not otherwise disclosed in the 2014 Year-End Draft Financial
Statements or the Company Disclosure Letter, with the notes to the financial
statements contained in the Company SEC Documents that were publicly available
prior to the date hereof, (y) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto or may be permitted by the SEC under the
Exchange Act) and (z) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations, cash flows and
shareholdersÂ’ equity for the periods indicated (subject to normal period-end
adjustments).

 



 

(c) The Company (i) maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" and
"internal control over financial reporting" (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, and (ii) has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation, to the CompanyÂ’s outside auditors and the
audit committee of the Company Board (A) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of such internal control over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect the CompanyÂ’s ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
CompanyÂ’s internal control over financial reporting. The CompanyÂ’s "disclosure
controls and procedures" are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or furnishes

 



      
 

 



 

under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all
such information is accumulated and communicated to the CompanyÂ’s management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act and SOX with respect to
such reports. The CompanyÂ’s management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the CompanyÂ’s internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX, and, based on the most
recent such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. The
CompanyÂ’s system of "internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is reasonably sufficient in all
material respects to provide reasonable assurance (1) that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, (2) that receipts and expenditures are being made in
accordance with the authorization of management and the directors of the
Company, and (3) regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the CompanyÂ’s assets that would materially
affect the CompanyÂ’s financial statements. No significant deficiency, material
weakness or fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees was identified in managementÂ’s assessment of internal controls as of
January 1, 2011 (nor has any such deficiency, weakness or fraud been
identified after that date).

 



 

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its officers has received notice from any
Governmental Entity questioning or challenging the accuracy, completeness,
form or manner of filing or submission of the certifications of the then-
acting Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company
furnished by the Company with the SEC and all certifications required under
Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or Section 302 or 906 of SOX.

 



 

(e) Since January 1, 2011, (i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer, employee,
auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has received notice of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices and (ii) no attorney representing the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of
its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Company Board or any
committee thereof or to any director or officer of the Company.

 



 

(f) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of all
written comment letters from the staff of the SEC received by the Company
since January 1, 2011 relating to the Company SEC Documents and all written
responses of the Company thereto other than with respect to requests for
confidential treatment. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in
comment letters received by the Company from the SEC staff with respect to any
Company SEC Documents and, to the knowledge of the Company, none of the
Company SEC Documents (other than confidential treatment requests) is the
subject of ongoing SEC review. There are no internal investigations, or to the
knowledge of the Company, SEC

 



      
 

 



 

inquiries or investigations or other governmental inquiries or investigations
pending or threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of the
Company.

 



 

Section 3.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as set forth in Section 3.6
of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise, except for liabilities and obligations (a)

Financial Statements, (b) incurred in the ordinary course of business since

as a whole.

to the Company and its Subsidiaries to be contained in the Proxy Statement

applicable Law, and will not, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed
to holders of Shares or at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of any material fact, or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not false or misleading at the time and in light of the
circumstances under which such statement is made, except that no
representation is made by the Company with respect to the information supplied
by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been conducted in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (b) there has not

have, a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any material damage to any material
property owned or leased by the Company of any of its Subsidiaries and (c)
there has not been any action taken or not taken that, if occurred after the
date hereof, would have resulted in a breach of _Section 5.1(b)(iv)_, _(xii)_
, _(xiii)_ or _(xiv)_.

be expected to result in a material penalty under the IRS Closing Agreement
Program if discovered during an IRS audit or investigation;

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.3_, if at any

negotiations or furnish such information, enter into any agreement related to
any Acquisition Proposal or accept any offer or proposal relating to an
Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be expected to constitute or result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under

Company may (x) furnish and make available information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal

Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in
accordance with _Section 5.3(c)_) (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ "), (iii) take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover
Laws or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in
the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, inapplicable to any
transactions contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal (including approving any
transaction under Chapter 23B.19 of the WBCA), or (iv) resolve, agree or
propose to take any such actions.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 5.3(d)_, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval, if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to constitute or result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law, then, prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may solely in
response to a Superior Proposal received on or after the date hereof that has
not been withdrawn or abandoned and that did not result from a breach of this
Agreement, make an Adverse Recommendation Change in order to cause the Company
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to such _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ (including
payment of the Termination Fee, as defined in _Section 7.3(c)(iii)_ hereof)
and concurrently enter into a binding definitive agreement to effect such
Superior Proposal, provided that the Company and its Subsidiaries have (i)
complied with _Section 5.3(a)-(e)_ with respect to such Superior Proposal
(except with respect to immaterial breaches of the obligations to deliver
notices or other writings pursuant to _Sections 5.3(c)_ ), (ii) complied in
all material respects with _Sections 5.3(a)-(e)_ with respect to any other
Superior Proposal and (iii) complied with _Section 5.3(f)_ with respect to
any Superior Proposal. Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof
shall make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ or cause the Company to enter into a binding
definitive agreement to effect such Superior Proposal unless the Company has
first complied with the provisions of _Section 5.3(f)_ and, after so
complying, the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel) that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to
constitute or result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the

 



      
 

 



 

shareholders of the Company under applicable Law and such Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(f) The Company Board shall not take any action set forth in _Section 5.3(e)_
unless the Company has first (i) provided written notice to Parent (a "
_Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") advising Parent that the Company Board
has determined that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, that the
Company Board intends to make such Adverse Recommendation Change and to
terminate this Agreement, specifying the financial and other material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal, identifying the Person making such
Superior Proposal and providing copies of any agreements intended to effect
such Superior Proposal, and the Company Board, (ii) negotiated in good faith
with Parent, and caused the Company and its Representatives to negotiate in
good faith with Parent, during the five (5) Business Day period following
ParentÂ’s receipt of the Notice of Recommendation Change (the " _Notice Period_
"), to enable Parent to make a binding counteroffer to amend the terms of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior
Proposal, and (iii) after complying with _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ ,
reaffirmed such determination in light of ParentÂ’s binding counteroffer, if
any; _provided_ , _however_ , that if during the Notice Period any revisions
are made to an Acquisition Proposal and such revisions are material (it being
understood and agreed that any change to consideration with respect to such
proposal is material), the Company shall deliver a new Notice of
Recommendation Change to Parent and shall comply with the requirements of this
_Section 5.3(f)_ with respect to such new Notice of Recommendation Change,
except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to a two (2) Business Day
period for purposes of this _Section 5.3(f)_.

from taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A, Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act or making any required disclosure to the shareholders of the
Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, failure to so
disclose would constitute a violation of applicable Law; _provided_ , however,
that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication
or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless
the Company Board expressly reaffirms the Company Recommendation and rejects
any Acquisition Proposal within three (3) Business Days after such stop, look
and listen communication.

(i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a customary

consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) to be superior from a financial point of view to the
shareholders of the Company to the Merger, taking into account all relevant
circumstances, including, without limitation, all the terms and conditions of
such proposal and this Agreement (including the Termination Fee, any changes
proposed by Parent to the terms of this Agreement and the potential time
delays and other risks to consummation associated with such offer) and (B)
that is reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such offer and (C) for which any
necessary financing is fully committed (including with respect to any
indebtedness that could be required to be repaid in connection with the
transactions contemplated by such offer).

 



 

(i) Any action taken or not taken by any Representative of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that if taken or not taken by the Company would constitute
a breach of this _Section 5.3_ shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement by
the Company.

holders of Shares that they approve this Agreement and shall include such
recommendation and the Company Determination in the Proxy Statement and (y)

expected to (i) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege
held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) cause significant
competitive harm to the Company or its Subsidiaries if the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated or (iii) otherwise violate
any applicable Law, provided that the Company has used its reasonable best
efforts to provide such access or disclose such information in a manner that
does not result in such a waiver, harm or violation.

eligibility for retiree health and welfare benefits, Parent shall give each
employee of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Subsidiaries who shall have been employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_
") full credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries to the
extent such service would be recognized if it had been performed as an
employee of Parent for purposes of (i) eligibility and vesting under any
Parent Employee Plans, but not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined
benefit plan of Parent, and (ii) determination of benefit levels under any
Parent Employee Plan or policy of general application relating to vacation or
severance, in either case for which the Continuing Employees are otherwise
prospectively eligible and in which the Continuing Employees are offered
participation, but except where such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits. For the avoidance of doubt, no Continuing Employee shall be
retroactively eligible for any Parent Employee Plan, including any such Parent
Employee Plan that was frozen prior to the Effective Time. In addition, Parent
shall waive, or cause to be

 



      
 

 



 

waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions to the
same extent such limitations would not have been applicable to such Continuing
Employee under the terms of any comparable medical and dental plan of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. In addition, Parent shall provide that any
covered expenses incurred on or before the Effective Time by Continuing
Employees or such employeesÂ’ covered dependents shall be taken into account
for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket provisions after the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
expenses were taken into account under the comparable benefit plan and such
expenses shall also count towards any annual or lifetime limits, treatment or
visit limits or similar limitations that apply under the terms of the
applicable plan for the plan year in which the Effective Date occurs. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Parent Employee Plan_ " means any
"employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA),
"employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any
other plan or policy under which service with Parent is relevant to
eligibility, vesting and/or level of benefits, for the benefit of, or relating
to, the current employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries and with respect to
which eligibility has not been frozen.

 



 

(b) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to
continue the employment of any specific person. The provisions of this
_Section 5.7_ are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and
nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i)
constitute an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits plans
maintained for or provided to Continuing Employees prior to or following the
Effective Time, (ii) impede or limit Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any
Company Plan following the Effective Time or (iii) confer upon or give to any
person (including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former employees,
directors, or independent contractors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 5.7_)
under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent shall
promptly notify each other of (a) the discovery of any fact or circumstance
that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which, would cause or is reasonably likely to result in any of
the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article VI_ not being satisfied or
satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.8_
shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision
of this Agreement or (ii) limit the remedies available to the party sending or
receiving such notice; and (b) the receipt of any written communication
received from any Person alleging that a material consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.9 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director or employee may
have under any agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time through the
sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold
harmless each current (as of the Effective Time) and each former employee,
agent, officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against any and all
claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, penalties, settlements,
inquiries, fines and fees, costs and expenses, including actual attorneysÂ’
fees and disbursements and ERISA excise taxes (collectively, " _Costs_ ")
actually or reasonably incurred or suffered in connection with any actual or
threatened Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was
an employee, agent, officer, director or fiduciary of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the same extent provided under the Company Constituent
Documents (or, as relevant, those of the applicable Subsidiary of the Company)
as at the date hereof. In the event of any such Action, each Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any
Action from Parent or the Surviving Corporation to the same extent provided
under the Company Constituent Documents (or, as relevant, those of the
applicable Subsidiary of the Company) as at the date hereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein (but subject to any superior rights contained
in the Company Constituent Documents (or, as relevant, those of the applicable
Subsidiary of the Company) or applicable indemnification agreements to which
any Acquired Company is a party including the contract rights set forth in the
CompanyÂ’s Constituent Documents), prior to making any payment or advance in
respect of the indemnification obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_,
the Person who is requesting such indemnification or advance shall agree to
repay such payments or advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification.

 



 

(b) Except as may be required by applicable Law, Parent and the Company agree
that for a period of six years from the Effective Time, all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as
provided in the Company Constituent Documents (or, as relevant, those of the
Subsidiary) or in any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party
and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and
continue in full force and effect, and for a period of six years from the
Effective Time shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such
Indemnified Party.

 



 

(c) Parent shall, prior to the Effective Time, pay for and cause to be
obtained, and to be effective at the Effective Time, one or more prepaid
"tail" insurance policies for the Persons who, as of the date hereof, are
covered by the CompanyÂ’s existing DandO Insurance, with a claims period of at
least six years from the Effective Time with terms and conditions (including
scope and coverage amounts) that are, taken as a whole, at least as favorable
as the CompanyÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’ existing DandO Insurance, for claims
arising from facts or events that occurred prior to the Effective Time,
covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
that the maximum aggregate premium for such DandO Insurance that Parent shall be
required to expend shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the annual
DandO Insurance

 



      
 

 



 

premium for the CompanyÂ’s current fiscal year, which annual premiums are set
forth in Section 3.18 of the Company Disclosure Letter; and if such amount is
not sufficient to purchase DandO Insurance in such maximum amount, then Parent
shall purchase such amount of insurance with the best coverage reasonably
available as can be purchased for an aggregate amount that is equal to three
hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium for such policies for the
CompanyÂ’s current fiscal year. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
comply with its obligations under such policies for the full term of at least
six years.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) with respect to which an
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification is instituted against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
then the provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall continue in effect until the
final disposition of such Action.

 



 

(e) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

 



 

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations
set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual
who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Anti-Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Law is or may become
applicable to this Agreement (including the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby), each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and their
respective boards of directors shall grant all such approvals and take all
such actions as are reasonably necessary or appropriate so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable hereafter on the
terms contemplated hereby, and otherwise act reasonably to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such Law on such transactions.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall provide Parent with
prompt notice of and copies of all proceedings and correspondence relating to
any Action against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors or officers by any shareholder of the Company arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with

 



      
 

 



 

the Company in the defense or settlement of any such shareholder Action, shall
give due consideration to ParentÂ’s advice with respect to such shareholder
Action and shall not settle or offer to settle any such Action without the
prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall be at ParentÂ’s sole
discretion).

 



 

Section 5.13 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to
this Agreement shall be a joint press release and thereafter, each of Parent
and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall
consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
make any public announcement without the prior consent of the other party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
except and solely to the extent required by applicable Law, court process or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or securities quotation system.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Transfer Taxes_. Except as provided for in _Section 2.2(c)_,
all stock transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, stamp, recording and
other similar Taxes (including interest, penalties and additions to any such
Taxes) imposed on the Company or the Surviving Corporation or incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by either the Company or the Surviving Corporation. The Company and
Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution, and filing of all Tax
Returns, questionnaires or other documents with respect to such Taxes.

 



 

Section 5.15 _Company Equity Awards_. The Company shall adopt such resolutions
and take all necessary actions, including obtaining any required consents from
all holders of outstanding Company Stock Options and Restricted Shares that
are necessary to effect the transactions described in _Section 2.1_. Promptly
following the taking of such actions, the Company shall, after consultation
with Parent, deliver to the holders of Company Stock Options and Restricted
Shares, appropriate notices setting forth such holdersÂ’ rights pursuant to the
Company Equity Plans and this Agreement. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such
notices prior to the mailing or delivery thereof to the holders of Company
Stock Options and Restricted Shares, and the Company shall give reasonable and
good faith consideration to all additions, deletions, changes or other
comments suggested by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel.

which case as of such date), except for inaccuracies that in the aggregate do
not amount to more than $150,000, (ii) the representation and warranty in
_Section 3.8(b)(i)_ (Absence of Certain Changes or Events) shall be true and

the other representations and warranties of the Company set forth herein shall
be true and correct both when made and at and as of the Closing Date, as if

representations and warranties to be so true and correct (without giving
effect to any qualification as to materiality, Material Adverse Effect or
similar qualification set forth therein) does not have, has not had and could
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. Parent shall have received a certificate signed on
behalf of the Company by an executive officer of the Company, dated as of the
Closing Date, to the foregoing effect.

 



 

(b) _Performance and Obligations of the Company_. The Company shall have
performed or complied in all material respects with each of its agreements and

(d) _No Pending or Threatened Actions_. No Action shall have been overtly
threatened in writing or commenced and be pending by or before any

be expected to have any of the effects referred to in _Section 6.1(c)_ or
_Section 6.2(c)_.

 



 

(e) _2014 Year-End Audited Financial Statements_. (i) The Company shall have
delivered to Parent (A) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company as

Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of August 31, 2014 and 2013,
and their results of operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended August 31, 2014, in conformity with GAAP;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the condition in this _clause (C)_ shall not be
deemed to not be satisfied solely because the audit opinion contains a
qualification as to the effectiveness of the CompanyÂ’s internal control over
financial reporting and (ii) the 2014 Year-End Audited Financial Statements
shall not be different in any material respect from the 2014 Year-End Draft

enter into this Agreement.

Parent and Merger Sub set forth herein shall be true and correct both when
made and at and as of the Closing Date, as if made at and as of such time
(except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as
of such date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties
to be so true and correct (without giving effect to any qualification as to
materiality or similar qualification set forth therein) does not prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of
Parent and Merger Sub by an authorized officer of each, dated as of the
Closing Date, to the foregoing effect.

the parties in interest at the time of the amendment.

Time, the parties may (by action taken or authorized by their respective
boards of directors, if required), to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
the other party or parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies

the other party or parties contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that

agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized
officer on behalf of such party or parties, as applicable. No failure or delay
of any party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or
power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or
power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. Except as otherwise
provided herein, the rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would
otherwise have hereunder.

jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision
had never been contained herein, so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties intend
that the rights, limitations and remedies contained in _Section 5.3_ and

such rights, limitations and remedies shall not be severable in any manner
that restricts a partyÂ’s remedies or rights under this Agreement.

HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,

Parent Disclosure Letter are not intended to constitute, and shall not be
construed as constituting, representations or warranties of the Company and
Parent, respectively, except and to the extent

 



      
 

 



 

expressly provided in this Agreement. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter
shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be
disclosed by this Agreement. Inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission that
such item is material or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. Descriptive headings in the Company Disclosure Letter
and the Parent Disclosure Letter are inserted for reference purposes and for
convenience of the reader only, and shall not affect the interpretation
thereof or of this Agreement. Nothing contained in the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an admission of
liability or responsibility in connection with any pending, threatened or
future matter or proceeding.

adverse effect on the ParentÂ’s ability to satisfy, its obligations under this
Agreement or (b) violate, result in a default under, or conflict with
contract, agreement or understanding or any applicable Law binding upon
Parent, except for such violations, defaults or conflicts which are not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to prevent Parent from

likely to prevent Parent from satisfying, or have a material adverse effect on
the ParentÂ’s ability to satisfy, its obligations under this Agreement.

Company, and any such action shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement.

 



 

7.3 _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement
of the Parent and the Shareholder, except that any amendment of the last
sentence of Section 1.1 shall, in addition, require the agreement of the
Company, and this Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by the parties hereto. Subject to applicable Law, any party
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other

and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, (c) waive compliance by the other party with any
agreement contained herein or (d) waive any condition to which its obligations

an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any party in exercising

partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other
right hereunder.

right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, as a whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any party without the prior
written consent of the other party, and any such assignment without such prior
written consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

7.8 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts and by different parties in separate counterparts (including
