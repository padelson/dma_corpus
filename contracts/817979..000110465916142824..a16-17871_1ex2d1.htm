(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be

of further action by the Company or any other Person, the certificate of
incorporation of the Company shall be amended so as to read in its entirety in
the form set forth as _Exhibit A_ hereto, and as so amended shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. In addition, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation shall take all necessary action such
that, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended so as
to read in its entirety in the form set forth as _Exhibit B_ hereto, and as
so amended shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time, each to hold office until their respective successors shall
have been duly elected or

 



      
 

 



 

appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal,
in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time, each to hold office until their respective
successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal, in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills
of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the
Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of
either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments
of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions
and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any
and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or
assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 



 

1.2 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ ") will take place at 8:00 a.m., local time, on the third Business
Day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the
Closing), at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 330 North Wabash Avenue,
Suite 2800, Chicago, Illinois 60611, unless another time, date or place is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), the
Closing shall occur on the earlier to occur of (a) a date during the Marketing
Period specified by Parent on no less than three Business Days notice to the
Company and (b) the third Business Day following the end of the Marketing
Period (subject, in each case, to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in _Article 6_ for the Closing as of the date determined pursuant
to this proviso). The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to
as the " _Closing Date_ ". On the Closing Date, or on such other date as
Parent and the Company may agree to, the parties shall cause a certificate of
merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger
shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, or such later date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and
specified in the Certificate of Merger (such date and time at which the Merger
becomes effective hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE 2 ** 
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER**

 



 

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled or converted
pursuant to _Sections 2.1(b)_ or _2.1(c)_ or Dissenting Shares, shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive $2.58 per Share (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), payable net to the holder in cash, without
interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law, upon
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section
2.2_. As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be
paid in accordance with _Section 2.2_.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. Each Share held
by the Company as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub (or
any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub), in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or
payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof.

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub Equity Interests_. All outstanding shares of capital stock of
Merger Sub held immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become (in the aggregate) 100 shares of newly and validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
a bank or trust company to act as the paying agent (the identity and terms of
designation and appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Company) for purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration in
connection with the Merger in accordance with this _Article 2_ (the " _Paying
Agent_ "). Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the
Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement. In the event such deposited funds are
insufficient to make the payments contemplated pursuant to _Section 2.1_,
Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent
such additional funds to ensure that the Paying Agent has sufficient funds to
make such payments. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders
of the Shares in accordance with this _Article 2_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any such investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the
United States government or rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investor
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers

 



      
 

 



 

acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $5,000,000,000 or in
mutual funds investing in such assets. Earnings from such investments shall be
the sole and exclusive property of the Surviving Corporation, and no part of
such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares.

 



 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than three Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares
represented by certificates (the " _Certificates_ "), which Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form as Parent and the Paying Agent
shall reasonably agree; and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as
provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
of the Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) to the Paying Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with
delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with
respect to such Certificates, and such other documents as may be reasonably
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificates shall
be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificates (without interest, and after giving effect to
any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.5_), and any
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall
have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such
Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement,
except for Certificates representing Shares that are Dissenting Shares, which
shall be deemed to represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of
such Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of
the DGCL.

 



 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Shares represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall be required to deliver a Certificate or,
in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust
Company, an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, to receive the
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-
Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company whose Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement shall,

 



      
 

 



 

upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other
evidence of transfer or surrender as the Paying Agent may reasonably request),
be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and
deliver to The Depository Trust Company or its nominee as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of each such Book-Entry Share
a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Merger Consideration
(without interest, and after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.5_), and such Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall
be cancelled. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event
later than three Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Book-Entry
Shares not held through The Depository Trust Company: (A) a letter of
transmittal, which shall be in such form as Parent and the Paying Agent shall
reasonably agree; and (B) instructions for completing and returning such
letter of transmittal in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon delivery
of such letter of transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, the holder of such Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in
immediately available funds equal to the Merger Consideration (without
interest, and after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided
in _Section 2.5_), and such Book-Entry Shares shall at the Effective Time be
cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry
Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares
are registered. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon
due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or surrendered as contemplated
hereby, each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash
as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Book-Entry Shares representing
Shares that are Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed to represent the
right to receive payment of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with
and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of Shares in accordance with this _Article 2_
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
that represented ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. Any portion of
the funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made
available to the Paying Agent that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the nine month anniversary of the
Effective Time will be returned to the Surviving Corporation or an affiliate
thereof designated by the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not tendered its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_ prior to such time
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of the Merger
Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by

 



      
 

 



 

applicable Law, in respect of such holders surrender of their Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_. Any
Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity will, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation or an affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective affiliates will be
liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section
2.2(a)_, to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected
shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand.

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificates
to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. Parent may, in its reasonable
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger
Consideration, require the Person claiming such Certificates to be lost,
stolen or destroyed to deliver a bond in such amount as Parent may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary (but subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.3_), Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
did not vote in favor of the adoption of the Agreement, and who is entitled to
demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with,
and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares,
the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and cease to
exist, and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the rights granted to them under Section 262 of
the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws
or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other
applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be
exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in
accordance with this _Article 2 _and shall not thereafter be deemed to be
Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Shares and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to
be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any

 



      
 

 



 

such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing, except to the extent
required by applicable Law.

 



 

2.4 _Treatment of Options and Restricted Stock Units_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, each option to purchase
Shares (each a " _Company Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled
and shall only entitle the holder of such Company Option to receive (without
interest) an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of
Shares subject to the Company Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price of such Company
Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment pursuant to _Section 2.5_; provided that any such Company Option with
respect to which the per-share exercise price subject thereto is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration shall be canceled in exchange for no
consideration. The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holders of Company Options the cash
payments described in this _Section 2.4(a)_ as soon as practicable following
the Closing Date through the Surviving Corporations payroll system, but not
later than fifteen days following the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each
restricted stock unit that (i) is vested, but the Shares subject thereto are
not deliverable until a later date, or (ii) vests solely on the passage of
time with respect to the Shares (each a " _Company RSU_ ") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, whether vested or unvested,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Company RSU to
receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment pursuant to _Section 2.5_. At the Effective Time, each
restricted stock unit that vests based on achievement of performance metrics
(" _Performance RSU_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall vest in accordance with the terms of the agreement granting the
Performance RSU, and, if so vested, will become a " _Vested Performance RSU_ "
and, without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and shall entitle the holder of the Vested Performance RSU to
receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment pursuant to _Section 2.5_; _provided_ , for the avoidance of
doubt that in no event shall the number of Performance RSUs that become Vested
Performance RSUs hereunder exceed the number of Performance RSUs indicated on
the Company Stock Award Schedule (as defined in _Section 3.2(a)_), based on
achievement of performance metrics at target level (the "Target Performance
RSUs") and prorated to reflect the portion of the performance period
applicable to each such Target Performance RSU that will have elapsed as of
the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt any Performance RSU that is not
a Vested Performance RSU shall, at the Effective Time be automatically
cancelled and forfeited without any payment thereon. The Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holders
of Company RSUs and Vested Performance RSUs the cash payments described in
this _Section_ ___2.4(b)_ as soon as practicable following the Closing Date
through the Surviving Corporations payroll system, but not later than fifteen
days following the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Termination of Company Equity Plans_. As of the Effective Time, the
Accuride Corporation Second Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Award Plan
(the " _Company Equity Plan_ ") shall be terminated and no further Shares,
Company Options, Company RSUs, Performance RSUs, Equity Interests or other
rights with respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder.

 



 

(d) _Board Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take such other actions as are reasonably necessary and appropriate (including
using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any required consents) to
effect the transactions described in this _Section 2.4_.

 



 

2.5 _Withholding Rights_. The Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder or any other provision of applicable Law.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 



 

2.6 _Adjustments_. In the event that, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares shall occur as a
result of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of Equity Interests convertible into or exchangeable
for Shares), recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other similar event, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such event and to provide to holders of Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
provided that nothing in this _Section 2.6_ shall be deemed to permit or
authorize the Company to take any such action or effect any such change that
it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to take pursuant to this Agreement
(including _Section 5.1_).

 



 

ARTICLE 3 ** 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

Except (a) as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent and Merger Sub (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") prior to the
execution of this Agreement (with specific reference to the representations
and warranties in this _Article 3_ to which the information in such schedule
relates; _provided_ that, disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedule as to
a specific representation or warranty shall qualify any other sections of this
Agreement to the extent (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross
reference) it is reasonably apparent on its face that such disclosure relates
to such other sections), and (b) as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents
filed since January 1, 2014 and publicly available at least twenty-four hours
prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (other than any
disclosures contained in the "Forward Looking Statements" or "Risk Factors"
sections of such Company SEC Documents, and any other disclosures contained in
such Company SEC Documents to the extent that such other disclosures are
predictive, cautionary or forward-looking

 



      
 

 



 

in nature); _provided_ that, the foregoing clause (b) shall not be applicable
to _Section 3.2_ or _Section 3.4_, the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a
corporation or other entity duly organized, validly existing and, to the
extent applicable, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has the requisite corporate or other entity power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or
location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such
licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation (the " _Company Charter_ ") and Bylaws (the " _Company Bylaws_
") of the Company, as most recently filed with the Company SEC Documents, are
true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement. The Company is not in violation of any of the
provisions of the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws.

 



 

3.2 _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of eighty million
(80,000,000) Shares and ten million (10,000,000) shares of preferred stock,
par value $0.01 per share (" _Company Preferred Stock_ "). As of August 30,
2016, (i) 48,245,946 Shares (other than treasury shares) were issued and
outstanding, all of which were duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, (ii) no Shares were held in the
treasury of the Company or by its Subsidiaries, (iii) 4,301,147 Shares are
available for issuance under the Company Equity Plan, of which 3,082,369 are
subject to Company Options, Company RSUs and Performance RSUs (at target
level) outstanding as of such date and (iv) no shares of Company Preferred
Stock were issued and outstanding. Except for Company Options, Company RSUs
and Performance RSUs to purchase not more than 3,770,639 Shares (assuming
maximum level performance on the Performance RSUs), there are no options,
warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any
character to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound relating to the issued
or unissued capital stock or other Equity Interests of the Company, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for such capital stock or other
Equity Interests, or obligating the Company to issue or sell any shares of its
capital stock or other Equity Interests, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for such capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in, the
Company. Since August 30, 2016 and through the date of this Agreement, except
for the issuance of Shares upon the exercise of Company Options or Company
RSUs in accordance with their terms, the Company has not issued any shares of
its capital stock or other Equity Interests, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for such capital stock or other Equity Interests, other than
those shares of capital stock reserved for issuance described in this _Section
3.2(a)_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Company has
delivered to Parent a true and complete list as of the close of business on
August 30, 2016 of the holders of awards granted under the Company Equity Plan
(the " _Company Stock Awards_ "), including, on a holder by holder and grant
by grant basis, the date on which each such Company Stock Award was granted,
the type and number of Company Stock Awards granted, the expiration date of
such

 



       
 

 



 

Company Stock Award, the price at which such a Company Stock Award may be
exercised (if applicable), the date upon which any Company RSU is to be
settled (if such Company RSU represents "nonqualified deferred compensation"
for purposes of Section 409A of the Code) and the vesting schedule (including
target vesting amount with respect to Performance RSUs, such amount the "
_Target Performance RSU Level_ ") (the " _Company Stock Award Schedule_ ") and
status of each such Company Stock Award. All Shares subject to issuance under
the Company Equity Plan have been duly reserved for issuance by the Company,
and upon issuance prior to the Effective Time on the terms and conditions
specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights.

 



 

(b) There are no outstanding contractual obligations or other commitments,
agreements or arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i)
restricting the transfer of, (ii) relating to or affecting the voting rights
of, (iii) requiring the repurchase, redemption, acquisition or disposition of,
or containing any right of first refusal with respect to, (iv) requiring the
registration for sale of, or (v) granting any preemptive or antidilutive right
with respect to, in each case, any Shares or any capital stock of, or other
Equity Interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company
having the right to vote (or convertible into or exchangeable for Equity
Interests in the Company having the right to vote) on any matters on which the
Companys stockholders may vote.

 



 

(c) _Section 3.2(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of all of the Subsidiaries of the Company and the authorized,
issued and outstanding Equity Interests of each such Subsidiary. None of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds (or has the right or obligation to
acquire) an Equity Interest in any other Person. Each outstanding share of
capital stock of or other Equity Interest in each Subsidiary of the Company is
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights and is owned, beneficially and of record, by the Company or
one or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens.
There are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or
commitments of any character to which any Subsidiary of the Company is a party
or by which any Subsidiary of the Company is bound relating to the issued or
unissued capital stock or other Equity Interests of such Subsidiary, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for such capital stock or other
Equity Interests, or obligating any Subsidiary of the Company to issue or sell
any shares of its capital stock or other Equity Interests, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such capital stock of, or other Equity
Interests in, such Subsidiary. There are no outstanding contractual
obligations or other commitments, agreements or arrangements of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to provide funds to, or make any investment (in the
form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Subsidiary of the
Company or any other Person, other than guarantees by the Company of any
indebtedness or other obligations of any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company.

 



 

3.3 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_.

 



 

(a) The Company has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform and comply with each of its obligations under this
Agreement and, subject to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, to
consummate the

 



      
 

 



 

Transactions. The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the
performance and compliance by the Company with each of its obligations herein,
and the consummation by it of the Transactions have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, subject to receipt
of the Company Stockholder Approval, and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of the Company and no other stockholder votes are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or the consummation by the Company of the Transactions. The
Company has duly and validly executed and delivered this Agreement and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger
Sub of this Agreement, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except as may be limited by Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether
considered in a Proceeding at law or in equity).

 



 

(b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held unanimously adopted
resolutions (i) approving and declaring advisable this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions, (ii) determining that the terms of the
Agreement and the Merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, the
Company and its stockholders, (iii) directing that this Agreement be submitted
to the stockholders of the Company at the Company Meeting and (iv)
recommending that its stockholders adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ "), which resolutions have not been subsequently withdrawn,
amended or modified as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Company Board has taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions
on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other
similar Law are not and will not be applicable to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger or the other
Transactions. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub set forth in _Section 4.8_, no other takeover, anti-
takeover, business combination, moratorium, fair price, control share
acquisition or similar Law applies to the Merger or the other Transactions.
The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have in effect any stockholder rights
plan, "poison pill" or other similar plan or arrangement. The only vote of
holders of any class or series of Shares or other Equity Interests of the
Company necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger is the
adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of
the Shares outstanding and entitled to vote thereon at the Company Meeting
(the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "). No other vote of the holders of
Shares or any other Equity Interests of the Company is necessary to consummate
the Transactions.

 



 

3.4 _No Conflicts_.

 



 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not and will not, and
the consummation by the Company of the Transactions and compliance by the
Company with the terms and provisions hereof will not, (i) assuming the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, conflict with or violate any
provision of the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws or any equivalent
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) assuming that
all consents, approvals, authorizations and permits described in _Section
3.4(b)_ have been obtained and all filings and notifications described in
_Section 3.4(b)_ have been made and any waiting periods thereunder have
terminated or expired, conflict with or

 



      
 

 



 

violate any Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by
which any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound
or affected or (iii) require any consent or approval under, result in any
breach or violation of or any loss of any benefit under, constitute a change
of control or default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) under or give to others any right of termination,
vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation
of a Lien on any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to, any Contract or Permit to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is party, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any
such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not and
will not, and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions and
compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof will not,
require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing or
registration with or notification to, any Governmental Entity, except (i) the
filing with the SEC of a proxy statement, in preliminary and definitive form,
relating to the Company Meeting (as amended or supplemented from time to time,
the " _Proxy Statement_ "), and other filings required under, and compliance
with other applicable requirements of, the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations of the NYSE in connection with this Agreement and the Merger, (ii)
filings required under, and compliance with any applicable requirements of,
the HSR Act and any other applicable Competition Laws, (iii) the filing and
effectiveness of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL and (iv)
where failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits,
or to make such filings, registrations or notifications, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

3.5 _SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 



 

(a) The Company has timely filed or furnished all reports, schedules, forms,
statements, registration statements, prospectuses and other documents required
to be filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC under the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act since January 1, 2014 (the " _Company SEC Documents_ ").
None of the Subsidiaries of the Company is required to make any filings with
the SEC.

 



 

(b) As of its respective filing date, and, if amended, as of the date of the
last amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, each Company SEC Document
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act,
the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the
rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such
Company SEC Document and did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company has made
available to Parent true and complete copies of all material correspondence
between the SEC, on the one hand, and the Company and any of its Subsidiaries,
on the other hand, occurring since January 1, 2014 and prior to the date
hereof. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments
in comment letters from the SEC staff with respect to any of the Company SEC
Documents. To the Knowledge of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company, as of the date hereof, none of the Company SEC Documents is the
subject of ongoing SEC review, outstanding SEC comment or outstanding SEC
investigation.

 



 

(c) The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents (including, in each case, any notes or schedules
thereto) (the " _Company SEC Financial Statements_ ") present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial condition and the results of operations, cash
flows and changes in stockholders equity of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(on a consolidated basis) as of the respective dates of and for the periods
referred to in the Company SEC Financial Statements, and were prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), subject, in the case of
interim Company SEC Financial Statements, to normal year-end adjustments and
the absence of notes.

 



 

(d) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 and paragraph
(e) of Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules 13a-15 and
15d-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that all information (both financial and
non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Companys management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure
controls and procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
presented in any applicable Company SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K
or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by such report or amendment based on such evaluation. Based on
the Companys managements most recently completed evaluation of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting, (i) the Company had no significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal
control over financial reporting that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (ii) the Company does not have Knowledge of
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. Since January 1, 2014, the Companys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to the Companys
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting, and the
Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of any material
written materials provided to the Companys auditors or the audit committee of
the Company Board relating to each of the foregoing. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has made any prohibited loans or "extensions of
credit" (within the meaning of

 



      
 

 



 

Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) to any executive officer (as defined in
Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

 



 

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether absolute or contingent, asserted or
unasserted, known or unknown, primary or secondary, direct or indirect, and
whether or not accrued), required by GAAP to be reflected or reserved on a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company (or the notes thereto) except (i) as

their businesses in all material respects only in the ordinary course and in a
manner consistent with past practice and (b) there has not been any change,
event, development, condition, occurrence or effect that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since
January 1, 2016 through the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor

breach of, or required Parents consent pursuant to, _Sections 5.1(c), (e)_ ,

therein applied since January 1, 2016.

by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy

Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading (except that no representation or warranty is made by the
Company to such portions thereof that relate expressly to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, or to statements made therein based on

by reference therein). The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and other
applicable Law.

with all material Laws and Orders applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any assets or properties owned or used by any of them (it
being understood and agreed that the foregoing shall not be

 



      
 

 



 

construed to be a representation regarding Intellectual Property infringement,
misappropriation, dilution and other similar violations of third party
Intellectual Property rights, the representations for which are set forth in
_Section 3.17_). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
any written communication since January 1, 2014 from a Governmental Entity
that alleges that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in material
violation of any Law or Order. During the past two years, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
director, officer, agent, employee or other Person acting on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has, in the course of its actions for, or
on behalf of, any of them violated any provision of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977, as amended (including the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the " _FCPA_ "), including by (i) using any corporate
funds for any unlawful contribution, gift, entertainment or other unlawful
payment to a candidate for foreign political office in order to secure a
business advantage; (ii) making any direct or, to the Companys Knowledge,
indirect unlawful payment to any foreign government official from corporate
funds in order to secure a business advantage; or (iii) making any unlawful
bribe, rebate, payoff, influence payment, kickback or other unlawful payment

Since January 1, 2014, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has

any investigation or inquiry with respect to a potential violation by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Representative thereof of the FCPA,
or (y) that alleges that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Representative thereof is in violation of the FCPA.

 



 

3.10 _Permits_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have all governmental
licenses, permits, certificates, approvals, consents, franchises,
registrations, billing and authorizations (" _Permits_ ") necessary for the
conduct of their business and the use of their properties and assets, as
presently conducted and used, and each of the Permits is valid, subsisting and
in full force and effect, except where the failure to have or maintain such
Permit has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted is not, and has not been since January 1, 2014, in
violation of, nor is the Company or its Subsidiaries in default or violation
under, any Permit, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred
which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
violation of any term, condition or provision of any Permit, except where such
default or violation of such Permit has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There are no actions
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, that seek the
revocation, cancellation or modification of any Permit, except where such
revocation, cancellation or modification, has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

3.11 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) _Section 3.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true
and complete list of each (i) "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA, whether or not subject to ERISA, (ii) any compensation,
employment, consulting, end of service or severance, termination protection,
change in control, transaction bonus, retention or similar plan, agreement,
arrangement, program or policy; or (iii) any other benefit or compensation
plan, contract, policy or arrangement providing for pension, retirement,
profit-sharing, deferred

 



      
 

 



 

compensation, stock option, equity or equity-based compensation, stock
purchase, employee stock ownership, vacation, holiday pay or other paid time
off, bonus or other incentive plans, medical, retiree medical, vision, dental
or other health plans, life insurance plans, and other employee benefit plans
or fringe benefit plans, in each case whether or not written, and (A) that is
sponsored, maintained, administered, contributed to or entered into by the
Company or its Subsidiaries, for the current or future benefit of any current
or former director, officer, employee or individual independent contractor of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, (each, a " _Service Provider_ "), or (B) for
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has or could reasonably expect to
have any direct or indirect material liability or obligation (each a "
_Company Benefit Plan_ "). Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
the Company has delivered to Parent a true and complete list as of the close
of business on August 30, 2016 of (i) the individuals who are parties to a
Performance Bonus Agreement with the Company (the " _Performance Cash Awards_
") and Cash Bonus Agreement with the Company (the " _Time Bonus Awards_ " and,
collectively with the Performance Cash Awards, the " _Company Cash Awards_ "),
(ii) the amount payable pursuant to each Performance Cash Award and Time Bonus
Award, and (iii) the vesting and payment schedule (including target vesting
amount with respect to Performance Cash Awards) (the "Company Cash Award
Schedule") Notwithstanding the first sentence of this _Section 3.11(a)_,
_Section 3.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule need not set forth a
list of any employment contracts or consultancy agreements for employees or
consultants who are natural persons that are pursuant to a standard form
previously provided to Parent that (i) do not provide for severance or notice
pay or benefits or (ii) where the base compensation provided under such
employment or consultancy agreement is less than $200,000 per annum and the
severance provided is not in excess of that required under local Law. The term
"Company Benefit Plan" does not, however, include any plans or arrangements
administered by a Governmental Entity or any statutorily-required: (A)
severance, (B) end of service gratuity, (C) holiday pay or bonuses, (D) sick
leave or (E) other paid time off (" _Governmental Plans_ "). Neither the
Company, nor to the Knowledge of the Company any other Person, has any express
or implied commitment, whether legally enforceable or not, to (i) modify,
change or terminate any Company Benefit Plan, other than with respect to a
modification, change or termination required by ERISA or the Code or (ii)
create any additional Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

(b) Each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects
in accordance with its terms and all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the
Code, and contributions and payments required to be made under the terms of
any of the Company Benefit Plans, Governmental Plans, or applicable Laws as of
the date of this Agreement have been in all material respects timely made or
paid or, if not yet due, have been properly reflected on the most recent
consolidated balance sheet included in the Company SEC Financial Statements
prior to the date of this Agreement. With respect to the Company Benefit Plans
and Governmental Plans, no event has occurred and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, there exists no condition or set of circumstances which could result
in material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan which is intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
as to its qualified status, and each trust established in connection with any
Company Benefit Plan which is intended to be exempt from federal income
taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code is so exempt, and to the Companys
Knowledge no fact or event has occurred that could adversely

 



      
 

 



 

affect the qualified status of any such Company Benefit Plan or the exempt
status of any such trust. There has been no prohibited transaction (within the
meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and other than a
transaction that is exempt under a statutory or administrative exemption) with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan that could reasonably be expected to
result in a material liability or obligation to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. No Proceeding (other than routine and uncontested benefits
claims) has been brought, or to the Knowledge of the Company is threatened,
against or with respect to any such Company Benefit Plan, including any audit
or inquiry by the IRS, the United States Department of Labor, or the United
States Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any material liability under ERISA Section 502. All tax,
annual reporting and other governmental filings required by ERISA and the Code
have been timely filed with the appropriate Governmental Entity and all
notices and disclosures have been timely provided to participants, in each
case, in all material respects.

 



 

(d) No Company Benefit Plan is a multiemployer pension plan (as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA) (" _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or other pension plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA (" _Title IV Plan_ ") and none of the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate has sponsored or contributed to or been required to
contribute to a Multiemployer Plan or other pension plan subject to Title IV
of ERISA. No liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than premiums timely
paid in accordance with Section 4007(a) of ERISA) has been incurred by the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full prior to
the date hereof, and no condition exists that presents a material risk to the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring or being subject (whether
primarily, jointly or secondarily) to any liability or obligation thereunder.
None of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred any withdrawal
liability under §4201 of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full prior to
the date hereof. With respect to each Title IV Plan (i) no reportable event
(within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA), other than an event for which
the reporting requirements have been waived by regulations, has occurred
within the six years prior to the date hereof or is expected to occur as a
result of the Transactions, (ii) no failure to meet the minimum funding
standard under Section 412 or 430 of the Code or Section 302 or 303 of ERISA
has occurred, (iii) all contributions (including installments) required by
Section 301 of ERISA and Sections 412 or 430 of the Code have been timely
made, (iv) no funding waiver has been applied for or been received or any
amortization period extended within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 or 303 of ERISA, (v) there are no funding-based limitations,
within the meaning of Section 436 of the Code, currently in effect, (vi) none
of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are the subject of any
lien arising under ERISA or Section 430(k) of the Code, and the Company has
not been required to post any security under ERISA or Section 401(a)(29) of
the Code, and no fact or event exists that would reasonably be expected to
give rise to any such lien or requirement to post any such security, and (vii)
all premiums (and interest charges and penalties for late payment, if
applicable) have been paid when due to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation.

 



 

(e) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions (alone or in conjunction with any other event, including any
termination of employment) will (i) entitle any current or former Service
Provider to any additional compensation or benefit (including any bonus,
retention or severance pay), (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or
result in any other material obligation to or pursuant to, any of the Company
Benefit Plans, or (iii) limit or restrict the right of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or, after the consummation of the Merger or the Transactions,
the Surviving Corporation, to merge, amend or terminate any of the material
Company Benefit Plans.

 



 

(f) Each Company Benefit Plan covering Service Providers located outside the
United States, (i) has been registered with or approved by a Governmental
Entity (as applicable), and to the Knowledge of the Company nothing has
occurred that would adversely affect such registration or approval, (ii) to
the extent it is intended to qualify for any special tax treatment, such
Company Benefit Plan meets all requirements for such treatment, and (iii) if
such Company Benefit Plan is required to be funded and/or book-reserved, it is
so funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable
actuarial assumptions and in accordance with any applicable Law or
requirements.

 



 

(g) Except as required by Law outside of the United States, or otherwise
described on _Section 3.11(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no Company
Benefit Plan provides (nor has the Company or any Subsidiary promised to
provide) retiree or post-employment, medical, disability or life insurance
benefits to any current or former employee or their dependents or
beneficiaries. Any termination, elimination or modification to any such
benefit that occurred prior to the date hereof was permitted by the terms of
the applicable Company Benefit Plan and all related agreements, and neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or could reasonably
expect to incur any material liability or obligation as a result of such
termination, elimination or modification.

Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has engaged in any unfair labor

National Labor Relations Board or any other Governmental Entity with respect
to Service Providers. There is no labor strike, dispute, lockout, slowdown or

2014. With respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries has or

employment agreement, nondisclosure agreement, common law nondisclosure

ruling, or other Order restricting the use, ownership, disposition or
enforcement thereof in any material respect.

 



      
 

 



 

The Company or one of its Subsidiaries solely owns all Company Owned
Intellectual Property, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted
Liens). The Company and its Subsidiaries have the right to use all
Intellectual Property that is necessary to conduct the businesses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, including all Company
Material Intellectual Property, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 



 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, nor the performance of this Agreement by the Company nor the
consummation of the Transactions, will result in the loss, forfeiture,
termination, or other impairment of, or give rise to a right of any Person to
limit, terminate, or consent to the continued use of, any rights of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any Intellectual Property or any Company
Systems.

expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is, or has been at any time
since January 1, 2013, infringing, misappropriating, diluting, or otherwise
violating the Intellectual Property rights of any Person, including through
the conduct of their respective businesses. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any charge, complaint, claim, demand, or other
notice, or has been a party to any Proceeding (and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, none of the foregoing have been threatened), since January 1, 2013
(i) alleging any infringement, misappropriation, dilution, or other violation
of any Intellectual Property (including any claim that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries must license or refrain from using any Intellectual Property
rights of any Person), or (ii) challenging the ownership, use, legality,
validity, enforceability, patentability or other registration of any Company
Owned Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of the Company, except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, no Person is, or was at
any time since January 1, 2013, infringing, misappropriating, diluting or
otherwise violating any Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made or
asserted any charge, complaint, claim, demand or other notice, or has been a
party to any Proceeding, since January 1, 2013 alleging any infringement,

Intellectual Property in any material respect.

 



 

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable
actions, consistent with their reasonable business judgment, to maintain and
protect the Company Owned Intellectual Property. All Company Owned
Intellectual Property that derives independent economic value, actual or
potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other Persons
who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use has been maintained
in confidence in accordance with protection procedures that are adequate for
protection, and in accordance with procedures customarily used in the industry
to protect rights of like importance. To the Knowledge of the Company, there
has been no unauthorized use or disclosure of any Company Material
Intellectual Property. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, all
former and current officers, directors, employees, personnel, consultants,
advisors, agents, and independent contractors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and each of their predecessors,

 



      
 

 



 

who have contributed to or participated in the conception and development of
inventions, improvements, designs, original works of authorship or other
Intellectual Property for such entities have entered into valid and binding
proprietary rights agreements with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or
predecessors pursuant to which such Person, has assigned or otherwise vested
sole ownership of such Intellectual Property in the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries in accordance with applicable Laws, and is bound to protect and
maintain the confidential information of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and
to the Knowledge of the Company, no such Person has breached its obligations
with respect to any Company Material Intellectual Property under any such
agreement).

 



 

(e) The computer systems, including the software, hardware, networks,
platforms and related systems, owned, leased or licensed by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company Systems_ ") are sufficient
in all material respects for the conduct of the respective businesses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted. In the last twenty-four
(24) months, there have been no failures, breakdowns, continued substandard
performance or other adverse events affecting any Company Systems that have
caused, or could reasonably be expected to result in, any material disruption
or material interruption in or to the use of any Company Systems or the
conduct of the businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The
Company and its Subsidiaries maintain commercially reasonable security,
disaster recovery and business continuity plans, procedures and facilities.
Since January 1, 2014, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, to
the Knowledge of the Company, there have not been any incidents of
unauthorized use of or access, or any other security breaches, with respect
to, any of the Company Systems (including with respect to any data or other
information contained therein). Since January 1, 2014, (i) the Company and its
Subsidiaries have, to the Knowledge of the Company, complied in all material
respect with all Data Privacy and Security Laws applicable to them, (ii) the
Company and its Subsidiaries have not received any written charges,
complaints, claims demands or other notices alleging that the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has violated any applicable Data Privacy and Security
Laws, and (iii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has, to the
Knowledge of the Company, made or suffered any unauthorized acquisition,
access, use or disclosure of any Personal Data that would trigger a
notification or reporting requirement under any Data Privacy and Security Laws
or been subject to any (A) audits relating to Personal Data that were
conducted other than in the ordinary course of business and that either
revealed any violations of any applicable Data Privacy and Security Laws in
any material respect, or that triggered a notification or reporting
requirement thereunder, or (B) investigations relating to Personal Data that

any material respect or triggered a notification or reporting requirement
thereunder.

Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified, has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

4.2 _Authority, Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform and comply with each of its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Transactions applicable to such party. The

obligations herein and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions applicable to it have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other corporate

due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement,
this Agreement constitutes Parents and Merger Subs legal, valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance
with its terms, except as may be limited by Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether
considered in a Proceeding at law or in equity).

 



 

4.3 _No Conflicts_.

 



 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub,
does not and will not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions and compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with the terms and
provisions hereof

 



       
 

 



 

will not, (i) conflict with or violate any provision of the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents of Parent or Merger
Sub, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and permits
described in _Section 4.3(b)_ have been obtained and all filings and
notifications described in _Section 4.3(b)_ have been made and any waiting
periods thereunder have terminated or expired, conflict with or violate any
Law applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent (each a
" _Parent Subsidiary_ " and, collectively, the " _Parent Subsidiaries_ "), or
by which any property or asset of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is bound or
affected or (iii) require any consent or approval under, result in any breach
or violation of or any loss of any benefit under, constitute a change of
control or default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) under or give to others any right of termination,
vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation
of a Lien on any property or asset of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary,
including Merger Sub, pursuant to, any Contract or Permit to which Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary is a party, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and
(iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other
occurrences which would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
in _Section 3.4_, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub does not and will not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger
Sub of the Transactions and compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with any of
the terms or provisions hereof will not, require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, or filing or registration with or notification to,
any Governmental Entity, except (i) the filing with the SEC of the Proxy
Statement, and other filings required under, and compliance with other
applicable requirements of, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of
the NYSE, (ii) filings required under, and compliance with any applicable
requirements of, the HSR Act and any other applicable Competition Laws, (iii)
the filing and effectiveness of the Certificate of Merger as required by the
DGCL and (iv) where failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations
or permits, or to make such filings, registrations or notifications would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.4 _Litigation_. There is no Proceeding pending, or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub is subject
to any outstanding Order that has had or would reasonably be expected to have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.5 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy
of the executed Debt Commitment Letter and Equity Commitment Letter. Neither
of the Commitment Letters has been amended or modified in any manner prior to
the date of this Agreement, and, as of the date hereof, the respective
commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is a party to any
agreement, side letter or other arrangement relating to the Financing that
could reasonably be expected to affect the availability of the Financing on
the Closing Date, or that could reasonably be expected to make the funding of
the Financing on the Closing Date less likely to occur, other than as set
forth in the Commitment Letters. On the Closing Date, assuming the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Article 3_
and compliance by the Company with its obligations pursuant to _Section 5.1_,
the aggregate proceeds of the Financing, to the extent funded in accordance
with the terms of the Commitment

 



      
 

 



 

Letters (both before and after giving effect to the exercise of any or all
"market flex" provisions related thereto), will be sufficient for Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
payment of the Merger Consideration, in accordance with the terms hereof. As
of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and
represent valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto, to provide the financing
contemplated thereby subject only to the satisfaction or waiver in accordance
with the terms thereof of the Financing Conditions, except as may be limited
by Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by
general equitable principles (whether considered in a Proceeding at law or in
equity). Parent has fully paid (or caused to be fully paid) any and all
commitment fees and other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the
date of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters. As of
the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent or,
to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under any of the
Commitment Letters. The only conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing on the Closing Date
are the Financing Conditions. As of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to
believe that (i) any of the Financing Conditions will not be satisfied on or
prior to the Closing Date or (ii) the Financing in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby will not be made available to
Parent on the Closing Date. Parent understands and acknowledges that under the
terms of this Agreement, Parents obligation to consummate the Merger is not
in any way contingent upon or otherwise subject to Parents consummation of
any financing arrangements, Parents obtaining of any financing or the
availability, grant, provision or extension of any financing to Parent.

 



 

4.6 _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Guarantors have delivered to the Company the Guaranty dated as of the date
hereof. The Guaranty is in full force and effect and is a valid and binding
obligation of each Guarantor, enforceable against each Guarantor in accordance
with its terms, except as may be limited by Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether
considered in a Proceeding at law or in equity). No event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on
the part of either Guarantor under the Guaranty.

 



 

4.7 _Proxy Statement; Other Information_. None of the information supplied or
to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date that the Proxy Statement or
any amendment or supplement thereto is mailed to holders of Shares and at the
time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading (except that no representation or warranty is made by
Parent or Merger Sub to such portions thereof that relate expressly to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to statements made therein based on
information supplied by or on behalf of Company for inclusion or incorporation
by reference therein).

 



 

4.8 _Ownership of Company Capital Stock_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any
Parent Subsidiary beneficially owns any Shares as of the date hereof. Neither
Parent nor Merger Sub is, nor at any time during the last three years has
been, an "interested stockholder" of

 



      
 

 



 

the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL (other than as contemplated
by this Agreement).

 



 

4.9 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) that the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in _Section _3.5(c) and _Section _3.5(e) (without giving
effect to any qualifications as to materiality or Company Material Adverse
Effect or other similar qualifications contained therein) are true and correct
in all material respects as of the Effective Time, (b) that the most recent
financial forecasts relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries delivered to
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement have been prepared in good faith
and on assumptions that were reasonable at the time such forecasts were
prepared and continue to be reasonable, and (c) the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_, then, immediately
after the Effective Time, after giving effect to the consummation of the
Merger and the consummation of the Financing, the Surviving Corporation will
be Solvent. For purposes of the foregoing, " _Solvent_ " means (i) the amount
of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries will exceed the value of all liabilities of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries as they mature or become due; (ii) the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged;
and (c) the Surviving Corporation will be able to pay its liabilities,
including contingent liabilities, as they mature in the ordinary course of
business.

 



 

4.10 _Ownership of Parent and Merger Sub_. All of the issued and outstanding
Equity Interests of Merger Sub are, and at the Effective Time will be, owned
directly or indirectly by Parent. Merger Sub was formed solely for purposes of
the Merger and, except for matters incident to formation and execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the performance of the transactions
contemplated hereby, has not prior to the date hereof engaged in any business
or other activities.

 



 

4.11 _Brokers_. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary nor any of their
respective officers or directors on behalf of Parent or such Parent Subsidiary
has employed any financial advisor, broker or finder or incurred any liability
for any financial advisory, brokers fees, commissions or finders fees in
connection with any of the Transactions.

 



 

4.12 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the business,
operations, assets (including Intellectual Property), liabilities, results of

Representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be required to (or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to)
afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that the Company

suppliers, distributors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or, except as
required pursuant to _Section 5.5_, any Governmental Entity, regarding the
business of the Company, this Agreement or the Transactions without the prior
written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with a Third Party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or

Subsidiaries and Representatives to, (x) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Third Party that may be
ongoing with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and (y) deliver a written
notice to any such Third Party to the effect that the Company is terminating
all discussions and negotiations with such Third Party with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, and requesting that such Third Party promptly return or
destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_, from and
after the Solicitation Period End Date until the Effective Time, or, if
earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 7_,

encourage any Acquisition Proposal or the making or submission thereof, or (y)
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with a Third Party regarding any Acquisition Proposal (other than

_Section 5.3_), or (z) furnish or provide any nonpublic information in
connection with, any Acquisition Proposal. Except as expressly permitted by
this _Section 5.3_, from and after the Solicitation Period End Date until the
Effective Time, or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article 7_, neither the Company Board nor any committee

set forth in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this sentence,
or any action set forth in the foregoing clause (vi) of this sentence (to the
extent related to the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this

Business Day following the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company shall
notify Parent in writing of the identity of each Exempted Person, together

Proposal. Notwithstanding the commencement of the obligations of the Company
under this _Section 5.3(b)_, from and after the Solicitation Period End Date,
the Company may continue to engage in the activities described in the second
sentence of this _Section 5.3(b)_ with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
submitted by an Exempted Person on or before the Solicitation Period End Date
until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the earliest of (A) the date on which
such Acquisition Proposal expires by its terms, (B) the date on which such
Exempted Person has otherwise terminated or withdrawn such Acquisition
Proposal (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any amended or revised
Acquisition Proposal submitted by such Exempted Person shall not be deemed to
constitute, in and of itself, an expiration, termination or withdrawal of such
previously submitted Acquisition Proposal) and (C) the 30th calendar day after
the Solicitation Period End Date; provided, that, such date shall be
automatically extended to be two Business Days after the end of any Notice
Period that would otherwise expire following such 30th calendar day deadline.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(b)_,
if at any time following the Solicitation Period End Date and prior to the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (i) the Company has received a
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party, (ii) the Company
has not breached this _Section 5.3_ (excluding immaterial, unintentional
violations) with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and (iii) the Company
Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, based on
information then available, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that failure
to take such actions would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Third
Party making such Acquisition Proposal, its representatives and potential
sources of financing pursuant to (but only pursuant to) one or more Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreements and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , however, that any non-public information
concerning the

 



      
 

 



 

Company or its Subsidiaries provided or made available to any Third Party
shall, to the extent not previously provided or made available to Parent or
Merger Sub, be provided or made available to Parent or Merger Sub as promptly
as reasonably practicable (and in no event later than twenty-four hours) after
it is provided or made available to such Third Party.

 



 

(d) From and after the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company shall
promptly (and in any event within the later of 24 hours and 5:00 p.m. (New
York City time) on the next Business Day) notify Parent in writing of the
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall identify the Third
Party making such Acquisition Proposal and include a copy of such Acquisition
Proposal (or, where such Acquisition Proposal was not submitted in writing, a
reasonably detailed written summary of the material terms of such Acquisition
Proposal). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall keep Parent
promptly informed (and in any event within the later of 24 hours and 5:00 p.m.
(New York City time) on the next Business Day) of any material changes or
developments relating to such Acquisition Proposal (including any change in
the price or other material terms thereof). The Company shall not terminate,
amend, modify, waive or fail to enforce any provision of any "standstill" or
similar obligation of any Person unless the Company Board (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(b)_,
if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (other
than as a result of a breach of this _Section 5.3_) (excluding any
immaterial, unintentional violations)) from a Third Party (including an
Exempted Person) that the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the
Company Board may, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, effect a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to such
Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_,
subject to the requirements of this _Section 5.3(e)_. The Company shall not
be entitled to effect a Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to this
_Section 5.3(e)_ or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_
unless:

 



 

(i) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such a Change of
Board Recommendation in response to the receipt of such Superior Proposal
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law;

 



 

(ii) the Company shall have provided to Parent at least three Business Days
prior written notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") of the Companys intention to
take such actions, which notice shall specify the basis for such Change of
Board Recommendation, the identity of the Third Party making such Superior
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and
shall include a copy of the most current draft of the Company Acquisition
Agreement to be entered into in respect of such Superior Proposal and any
other material documents with respect thereto;

 



       
 

 



 

(iii) during the Notice Period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall
have, and shall have caused its Representatives to have, engaged in good faith
negotiations with Parent and its Representatives regarding any amendments or
modifications to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and intended to
cause the relevant Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal; and

 



 

(iv) at the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board shall have considered
in good faith any proposed amendments or modifications to this Agreement
(including a change to the price terms hereof) and the other agreements
contemplated hereby that may be irrevocably offered in writing by Parent (the
" _Proposed Changed Terms_ ") no later than 11:59 a.m., New York City time, on
the last day of the Notice Period, and shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such
Proposed Changed Terms were to be given effect and that failure to make a
Change of Board Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 



 

In the event of any change to the price terms or any other material revision
or amendment to the terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again comply with
the requirements of this _Section 5.3(e)_ (which shall apply _mutatis
mutandis_ ) with respect to such new written notice.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(b)_,
the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, effect a Change of
Board Recommendation if the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) determines in good faith that an Intervening Event has occurred and
is continuing, subject to the requirements of this _Section 5.3(f)_. The
Company shall not be entitled to effect a Change of Board Recommendation
pursuant to this _Section 5.3(f)_ unless:

 



 

(i) the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
effect a Change of Board Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

 



 

(ii) the Company shall have provided to Parent at least four Business Days
prior written notice of the Companys intention to take such action, which
notice shall specify the basis for such Change of Board Recommendation,
including all available material information with respect to such Intervening
Event;

 



 

(iii) during such four Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to have, engaged
in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives regarding any
amendments or modifications to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent
and intended to enable the Company Board to proceed with the Company Board
Recommendation; and

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) at the end of such four Business Day period, the Company Board shall have
considered in good faith any proposed amendments or modifications to this
Agreement (including a change to the price terms hereof) and the other
agreements contemplated hereby that may be irrevocably offered in writing by
Parent no later than 11:59 a.m., New York City time, on the last day of such
four Business Day period, and shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a
Change of Board Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of
the Company if the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or violate Applicable Law. The issuance
by the Company or the Company Board of a "stop, look and listen" statement
pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change of
Board Recommendation.

 



 

(h) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this _Section _5.3 by any of its Representatives shall be deemed
to be a breach of this _Section _5.3 by the Company.

Third Party concerning (A) a merger, consolidation or other business
combination transaction involving the Company, (B) a sale, lease or other

Interests of any Subsidiary of the Company) or its Subsidiaries representing
20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
based on their fair market value as determined in good faith by the Company
Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof), (C) an issuance (including
by way of merger, consolidation, business combination or share exchange) of
Equity Interests representing 20% or more of the voting power of the Company,
or (D) any combination of the foregoing (in each case, other the Merger).

 



 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
(except the references therein to "20%" shall be replaced by "50%") that is
not solicited or received in violation of this _Section 5.3_ and that the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, taking into account such factors as the Company Board (or any duly
authorized committee thereof) considers in good faith to be appropriate
(including the conditionality, timing and likelihood of consummation of such
proposals), is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its
terms and, if consummated, would be more favorable

 



      
 

 



 

from a financial point of view to the Companys stockholders than the Merger
(taking into account any Proposed Changed Terms).

 



 

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any event, change, effect, development,
state of facts, condition or occurrence that is material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries that (A) was not known to or by the Company Board and could
not reasonably be expected to have been known to or by the Company Board as of
or prior to the date of this Agreement (or if known, the magnitude or material
consequences of which were not known and could not reasonably be expected to
have been known to or by the Company Board as of or prior to the date of this
Agreement), and (B) does not involve or relate to the receipt, existence or
terms of an Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(iv) " _Exempted Person_ " means any Person or group of Persons (so long as,
in the case of a group of Persons, the members of such group who were members
of such group immediately prior to the Solicitation Period End Date constitute
more than 50% of the equity financing of such group of Persons at all times
following the Solicitation Period End Date), from whom the Company or any of
its Representatives has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal after the
date of execution of this Agreement and prior to the Solicitation Period End
Date and with whom the Company or any of its Representatives are engaged in
good faith negotiations with respect to such Acquisition Proposal as of the
Solicitation Period End Date and, on or before the Solicitation Period End
Date, the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and such Acquisition Proposal has
not been withdrawn and has not expired or been terminated as of the
Solicitation Period End Date. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
_Section 5.3_ to the contrary, any Exempted Person shall cease to be an
Exempted Person for all purposes under this Agreement upon the earlier to
occur of (A) such time as the Acquisition Proposal made by such Person is
withdrawn, expires or is terminated (provided that, for the avoidance of
doubt, any amended or revised Acquisition Proposal submitted by such Exempted
Person shall not be deemed to constitute, in and of itself, an expiration,
termination or withdrawal of such previously submitted Acquisition Proposal)
and (B) the 30th calendar day after the Solicitation Period End Date;
provided, that, such date shall be automatically extended to be two Business
Days after the end of any Notice Period that would otherwise expire following
such 30th calendar day deadline (unless, prior to such time, the Company has
entered into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal and terminated this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(f))_.

 



 

5.4 _SEC Filings; Other Actions_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, but no later than within twenty Business Days, the Company shall
prepare and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC, which shall, subject to a
Change of Board Recommendation having been effected in accordance with
_Section 5.3_, include the Company Board Recommendation. Parent and Merger
Sub, and their counsel, shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the
Proxy Statement before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give
due consideration to any reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent and Merger Sub or their counsel. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to

 



      
 

 



 

respond to and resolve as promptly as practicable any comments by the SEC
staff in respect of the Proxy Statement. The Company will cause the definitive
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as of the record
date established for the Company Meeting as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, and in no event more than five Business Days after the
date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to
mail the definitive Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders prior to the
date that is five Business Days after the Solicitation Period End Date. The
Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with copies of any written
comments, and shall provide them a summary of any oral comments, that the
Company or its counsel receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt of such comments, and
any written or oral responses thereto. Parent and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review any such responses and the Company shall give
due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent and its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish all
information that is customarily included in a proxy statement prepared in
connection with transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement
concerning themselves and their affiliates as promptly as practicable
following the Companys reasonable request therefor. The Company and Parent
each agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Proxy Statement that shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect.

 



 

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall (i)
take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL, the Company Charter,
and the Company Bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable following the mailing
of the Proxy Statement (but no later than thirty-five days thereafter, unless
otherwise mutually agreed by Parent and the Company) for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Meeting_ "), with
the record date and meeting date of the Company Meeting to be selected after
reasonable consultation with Parent, and (ii) subject to a Change of Board
Recommendation having been effected in accordance with _Section 5.3_, shall
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including by postponing or adjourning the Company Meeting, after consultation
with Parent, to allow additional solicitation of proxies in order to obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval if necessary). The Company may postpone or
adjourn the Company Meeting from time to time (i) with the consent of Parent,
(ii) if a quorum has not been established, (iii) to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure which the Company Board has determined in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and
for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
the Companys stockholders prior to the Company Meeting, (iv) to allow
reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies if necessary in order
to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval or (v) if required by Law.

 



 

5.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable under
this Agreement and applicable

 



      
 

 



 

Law to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, including using
reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) obtain all consents,
approvals or waivers from, or participation in other discussions or
negotiations with, third parties, including under any Contract to which the
Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries is party or by which
such Person or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound, (ii)
obtain all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals,
orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities (including those in
connection with applicable Competition Laws), make all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings with and take all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid any Proceeding by,
any Governmental Entity (including in connection with applicable Competition
Laws), (iii) resist, contest or defend any Proceeding (including
administrative or judicial Proceedings) challenging the Merger or the
completion of the Transactions, including seeking to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that could
restrict, prevent or prohibit consummation of the Transactions, and (iv)
execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
Transactions and fully to carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Each of
the parties shall furnish to each other party such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably request in connection
with the foregoing. Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of
information, the Company and Parent shall have the right to review in advance,
and to the extent practicable each shall consult with the other in connection
with, all of the information relating to the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the Transactions. In exercising the foregoing
rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent shall keep each other reasonably
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices
or other written substantive communications received by the Company or Parent,
as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any
Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions, and, to the extent
practicable under the circumstances, shall provide the other party and its
counsel with the opportunity to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any substantive filing, investigation or
other inquiry in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Company and
Parent shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates to, make or cause to
be made all filings required under applicable Competition Laws with respect to
the Transactions as promptly as practicable and, in any event, file all
required HSR Act notifications within ten (10) Business Days after the date of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
all obligations of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub to obtain the Financing
shall be governed exclusively by _Section 5.10_ and _Section 5.11_, and not
this _Section 5.5_.

 



 

(b) Without limiting this _Section 5.5_, Parent agrees to use its best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, any and all steps and to make, or cause
to be made, any and all undertakings necessary to resolve, avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any applicable Competition Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable
the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable (and in any event, no later

 



      
 

 



 

than the Extended Outside Date), including (i) proposing, negotiating,
committing to, and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of any assets,
properties or businesses of Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or (ii) accepting any operational restrictions or otherwise
taking or committing to take actions that limit Parents or any Parent
Subsidiarys freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any
of the assets, properties, licenses, rights, product lines, operations or
businesses of Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
each case, as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
lifting or dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or
other Order in any suit or Proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect
of preventing or delaying the Closing beyond the Outside Date, as applicable.
If such efforts fail to resolve, avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any applicable Competition Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur, then
Parent shall, at the written request of the Company, use its reasonable best
efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court
by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any
Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the
Closing from occurring as promptly as practicable (and in any event, no later
than the Extended Outside Date). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, none of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to agree to any sale, transfer,
license, separate holding, divestiture or other disposition of, or to any
prohibition of or any limitation on the acquisition, ownership, operation,
effective control or exercise of full rights of ownership, or other
modification of rights in respect of, any assets, properties or businesses of
Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries that, in each
case, is not conditioned on the consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the
Company prior to the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

5.6 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article 7_, unless prohibited by applicable Law, each party
shall give prompt notice to the other parties if any of the following occur:
(a) receipt of any notice or other communication in writing from any Person
alleging that the consent or approval of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions; (b) receipt of any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity or the NYSE (or any other
securities market) in connection with the Transactions; or (c) such party
becoming aware of the occurrence of an event that could prevent or delay
beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Transactions or that would
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the Merger set
forth in _Article 6_ being incapable of satisfaction. Any such notice
pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall not affect any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement and any failure to make such
notice (in and of itself) shall not be taken into account in determining
whether the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ have been satisfied or give
rise to any right of termination set forth in _Article 7_.

 



 

5.7 _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, Parent and
Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, shall not issue
any press release or make any public statement with respect to the Merger or
this Agreement without the prior

 



      
 

 



 

written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (a) as may be required by applicable
Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities
exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant party is
subject, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow each other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance, or (b) with respect to any press release or other public statement
by the Company permitted by _Section 5.3_. The press release announcing the
execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of, and
shall not be issued prior to the approval of each of, the Company and Parent.
The Company shall file a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC attaching its
press release and copy of this Agreement as exhibits.

 



 

5.8 _Employee Benefit Matters._

 



 

(a) From the Effective Time until December 31, 2017, except as otherwise
agreed with the Chief Executive Officer of the Surviving Corporation, Parent
shall (i) provide or cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to provide to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time who remains so employed immediately
after the Effective Time (each a " _Continuing Employee_ ") base compensation
that is not less favorable than the base compensation provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide
or cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to
provide benefits and target annual cash bonus opportunity (excluding equity
award compensation) to each Continuing Employee that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the benefits and target annual cash bonus
opportunity (excluding equity award compensation) provided to the Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Benefit
Plans listed in _Section 3.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.8(a)_, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to
honor in accordance with their terms (including the terms to amend, modify or
terminate) all of the Companys employment, severance, retention and
termination plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements (including
any change in control or severance agreement between the Company and any
employee), in each case, listed on _Section 3.11(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(c) With respect to benefit plans maintained by Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation (including any vacation,
paid time-off and severance plans), for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, level of vacation, paid time off and severance benefits, and
vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accruals, early retirement subsidies,
or in relation to any equity or equity-based compensation or benefit) each
Continuing Employees service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as
reflected in the Companys records, shall be treated as service with Parent or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to the
same extent and for the same purpose as such service was credited to such
Continuing Employee under the analogous Company Benefit Plan as of the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication
of benefits and the foregoing service credit shall not apply with respect to
any defined benefit plan.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Parent shall use, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) to use, commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive,
or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions,
evidence of insurability, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
under any group health benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents)
will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to
the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-
at-work requirements and waiting periods would have applied or would not have
been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) to recognize, or cause to be recognized,
the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses
incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents)
during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of
satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations under the
relevant group health benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee (and
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time
but in such calendar year.

 



 

(e) Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be credited to such
Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and shall not be subject to
accrual limits or other forfeiture that did not apply under the applicable
Company Benefit Plan as of the date hereof and shall not limit future accrual
to the extent not limited under the applicable Company Benefit Plan as of the
date hereof.

 



 

(f) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.10_, the provisions of this
_Section 5.8_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and no Continuing Employee (or any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and
no provision of this _Section 5.8_ shall create such rights in any such
individuals. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall: (i) guarantee
employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or their respective affiliates to terminate the
employment of any Continuing Employee at any time and for any reason; (ii)
require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
affiliates to continue any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit
plans, programs or Contracts or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof following the Closing; or (iii) amend any Company Benefit
Plans or other employee benefit plans, programs or Contracts.

 



 

5.9 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and shall
advance expenses as incurred (provided that the Indemnitee to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such amounts if it is ultimately
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnitee is not
entitled to indemnification for such matter), to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, each present and former director and officer of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and each of their respective employees who serves
as a fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan (in each case, when acting in such
capacity) (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ")
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred
in connection

 



      
 

 



 

with any Proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, whenever asserted, arising out of or pertaining to any
action or omission by such Indemnitee relating to their position with the
Company or its Subsidiaries, including as a fiduciary of a Company Benefit
Plan, occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including in connection
with this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



 

(b) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect of,
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions) existing as of the
Effective Time in favor of an Indemnitee as provided in (i) the Company
Charter, the Company Bylaws or similar organization documents of any
Subsidiary of the Company in effect as of the date of this Agreement and (ii)
any indemnification Contract of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect as
of the date of this Agreement listed on _Section 5.9_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of no less than six
years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions in favor of an
Indemnitee as provided in (i) the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or
similar organization documents of any Subsidiary of the Company in effect as
of the date of this Agreement and (ii) any indemnification Contract of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement listed
on _Section 5.9_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and shall not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately
before the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that
all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in
respect of any Proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

 



 

(c) For six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain for
the benefit of those persons that are directors and officers of the Company as
of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance that provides
coverage for events occurring prior to the Closing Date (the " _D andO
Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less
favorable in the aggregate than the existing directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policy of the Company,
or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage then available; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall
not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of
300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be
deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" policies have been obtained
prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and
officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective
Time, including in respect of this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



 

(d) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or

 



      
 

 



 

conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each case, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause proper provision to be made so that such successor or
assign shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
5.9_.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such
individual may have under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or similar
organization documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement or in any
indemnification Contract of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect as of
the date of this Agreement listed on _Section 5.9_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. From and after the Effective Time, the obligations of Parent under
this _Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.9_
applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable
Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to
whom this _Section 5.9_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 5.9_).

 



 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this _Section 5.9_ is not prior to or in substitution for any
such claims under such policies.

 



 

5.10 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or
advisable to arrange the Debt Financing and to consummate the Debt Financing
on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter, including the following:

 



 

(i) maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and not permitting,
without the prior written consent of the Company, any amendment or
modification to be made to, not consenting to any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, and not replacing, the Debt Commitment Letter, if such
amendment, modification, waiver or replacement: (A) reduces the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be
paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing) below the amount
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(unless the Equity Financing has been increased by a corresponding amount or
Alternative Debt Financing has been made available in a corresponding amount)
or (B) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or
modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to (1) materially delay (taking into
account the Marketing Period) or prevent the Closing or (2) make the funding
of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing) on the Closing Date less likely to occur ( _provided_ , that (x)
Parent may amend or amend and restate the Debt Commitment Letter to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
that had not

 



       
 

 



 

executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof; and (y) Parent
shall keep the Company reasonably apprised of the status of the Debt
Financing, and shall promptly furnish to the Company copies of any drafts of
definitive agreements or other definitive documentation with respect to such
amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of any Debt Commitment Letter
that could reasonably be expected to affect the Debt Financing in the manner
contemplated by the foregoing subclauses (A) and (B) of this clause (i));

 



 

(ii) satisfying on or prior to the Closing Date all conditions to the Debt
Financing that are applicable to, and within the control of, Parent and/or the
Parent Subsidiaries; and

 



 

(iii) negotiating, executing and delivering Debt Financing Documents that
reflect the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or as may otherwise
be agreed (taking into account the limitations on amendments thereto as set
forth in _Section 5.10(a)(i)_) (including any "market flex" provisions
related thereto) and providing copies of drafts thereof exchanged with the
Financing Sources to the Company following the Companys reasonable request
therefor.

 



 

(b) Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of (i) any material breach or
repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letters of which Parent becomes
aware if such breach could reasonably be expected to result in a material
delay of the Closing Date or (ii) the receipt of any written notice of
termination of the Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

(c) In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (other than due
to the failure of a condition to the consummation of the Debt Financing
resulting from a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
of the Company set forth in this Agreement and as a result of which
alternative financing sources are not otherwise then available), Parent shall,
as promptly as practicable, notify the Company of such event and the reasons
therefor (to the extent known) and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
alternative financing (" _Alternative Debt Financing_ ") on terms and
conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent (as determined in
the reasonable judgment of Parent) than those set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter in an amount, when added to the portion of the Financing being replaced
that is still available, such that the aggregate funds available to Parent at
Closing will be sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In the event that Parent obtains Alternative Debt Financing
pursuant to this _Section 5.10(c)_, references to the "Debt Financing," the
"Financing," the "Debt Commitment Letter" and the "Commitment Letters" (and
other like terms in this Agreement) shall be deemed to be modified to refer to
such Alternative Debt Financing.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing in this _Section 5.10_ will require, and in no event will the
reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require, Parent to
(i) seek the Equity Financing from any source other than the investment funds
party to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity
Commitment Letter or (ii) pay any fees materially in excess of those
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including all "market flex"
provisions related thereto).

 



      
 

 



 

5.11 _Debt Financing Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use reasonable best efforts to provide such cooperation in connection with
the arrangement, syndication and consummation of the Debt Financing as is
reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ , that the Company shall in no
event be required to provide such assistance that shall unreasonably interfere
with its business operations. Such assistance shall include the following,
each of which shall be at Parents written request with reasonable prior
notice and at Parents sole cost and expense:

 



 

(i) participation by the senior management team of the Company in the
marketing activities undertaken in connection with the marketing of the Debt
Financing, including (A) preparation of customary marketing material and due
diligence sessions and drafting sessions related thereto and (B) a reasonable
number of road shows and meetings with prospective lenders and debt investors
(including a customary lender meeting with the Financing Sources acting as
lead arrangers or agents for, and material prospective Financing Sources for,
the Debt Financing);

 



 

(ii) participation by senior management of the Company in, and assistance
with, the preparation of rating agency presentations and meetings with rating
agencies;

 



 

(iii) delivery to Parent and its Financing Sources of the Financing
Information and Financing Deliverables;

 



 

(iv) providing and executing documents as may be reasonably requested by
Parent, including customary authorization letters and confirmations in
connection with the Financing Information;

 



 

(v) subject to customary confidentiality agreements, using commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with the due diligence investigation of the
Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Financing, to the extent
customary and reasonable;

 



 

(vi) reasonably cooperating with Parent in satisfying on a timely basis all
conditions to funding set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the
applicable Debt Financing Documents that are within the control of the
Company;

 



 

(vii) if reasonably requested in writing at least ten (10) business days prior
to Closing, providing at least three (3) Business Days prior to Closing, all
documentation and other information with respect to the Company and the
Subsidiaries of the Company that are guarantors under the Debt Financing
Documents, that any Financing Source has reasonably determined is required by
regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT ACT, Title III of
Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001);

 



 

(viii) cooperating in the prepayment in full and termination in full of any
Existing Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries, the termination in
full of all

 



      
 

 



 

guaranties and security interests in connection therewith and the delivery of
customary payoff letters, lien releases and termination documentation with
respect to the foregoing, in each case reasonably satisfactory to Parent;

 



 

(ix) using reasonable best efforts to (A) permit the prospective Financing
Sources involved in the Debt Financing to evaluate the Company and its
Subsidiaries current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies
and procedures relating thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral
arrangements, (B) cooperate with Parent to establish bank and other accounts
and blocked account agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with
the foregoing and (C) permit representatives of the prospective Financing
Sources to conduct customary commercial field examinations, inventory and
intellectual property appraisals and make audits and appraisals delivered for
the purposes of the Debt Financing;

 



 

(x) participation by senior management of the Company in the negotiation of
the Debt Financing Documents; and

 



 

(xi) requesting that its independent auditors as of the Closing cooperate with
the Debt Financing, including by providing the Specified Auditor Assistance;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that, (A) no obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any such certificate, document or instrument (other than
the authorization and representation letters referred to above) shall be
effective until the Closing and (B) none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action under any such certificate,
document or instrument that is not contingent upon the Closing (including the
entry into any agreement that is effective before the Closing) or that would
be effective prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) The Company shall have the right to review and comment on marketing
materials used in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing prior
to the dissemination of such materials to potential lenders or other
counterparties to any proposed financing transaction (or filing with any
Governmental Entity); _provided_ , that the Company shall communicate in
writing their comments, if any, to Parent and its counsel within a reasonable
period of time under the circumstances and consistent with the time accorded
to other participants who were asked to review and comment on such marketing
materials. The Company shall not be required to agree to any contractual
obligation relating to the Financing that is not conditioned upon the Closing
and that does not terminate without liability to the Company and its
affiliates upon the termination of this Agreement. The Company shall not be
required to deliver or cause the delivery of any legal opinions (but will
cooperate in providing information with local counsel to the Company) or
reliance letters in connection with the Debt Financing.

 



 

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos
in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ , that such logos shall be
used solely in a manner that is not intended or reasonably likely to harm,
disparage or otherwise adversely affect the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. In addition, the Company agrees that, upon Parents reasonable
request, it will cooperate with Parent to supplement the Financing Information
so that Parent may most effectively access the financing markets.

 



      
 

 



 

(d)

 



 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of any written request
by Parent or Merger Sub to do so, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to commence offers to purchase (including change of control offers)
and/or consent solicitations related to any or all of the outstanding
aggregate principal amount and all other amounts due pursuant to or under the
Companys 9.5% senior secured notes due 2018 (the " _Existing Notes_ "), on
such terms and conditions, including pricing terms, that are specified and
requested, from time to time, by Parent (each a " _Debt Tender Offer_ " and
collectively, the " _Debt Tender Offers_ ") and Parent shall assist the
Company in connection therewith; _provided_ that Parent shall only request the
Company to conduct any Debt Tender Offer in compliance with the documents
governing the applicable debt securities and applicable federal securities
Laws. The Company, and its counsel, shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review documentation with respect to any Debt Tender Offer before it is
distributed to holders of the Existing Notes or filed with the SEC, as
applicable, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give due consideration to any
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company or
its counsel. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the closing of the Debt Tender
Offers shall be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and the parties
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Tender
Offers to close on the Closing Date. Subject to the preceding sentence, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide
all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt
Tender Offers, including using reasonable best efforts in assisting with the
preparation of the offer to purchase, consent solicitation statement, letter
of transmittal and/or form of consent. The Company (A) shall waive any of the
conditions to the Debt Tender Offers (other than the occurrence of the
Closing) and make any change to the Debt Tender Offers, in each case, as may
be reasonably requested by Parent and (B) shall not, without the written
consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Tender Offers or make any
changes to the Debt Tender Offers. Parent shall ensure that, at the Effective
Time, the Company has all funds necessary to pay for such notes that have been
properly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Tender Offers. The
dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent, depositary, paying
agent and/or any other agents retained in connection with the Debt Tender
Offers shall be selected by Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Company. Without limiting _Section 5.11(e)_, the Company shall enter into
customary agreements (including indemnities) with such parties so selected and
on terms and conditions acceptable to Parent. Parent acknowledges that the
consummation of any Debt Tender Offer is not a condition to Closing.

 



 

(ii) With respect to the Existing Notes, if requested by Parent or Merger Sub
in writing on a timely basis, and solely to the extent permitted by the
documents governing such securities, in lieu of commencing a Debt Tender Offer
for such series, or in addition thereto, the Company shall, to the extent
permitted by the applicable indenture or other documents governing such series
of securities, (A) issue a notice of redemption at least 30 days but not more
than 60 days before the redemption date agreed with Parent (or such later time
as may be required by such indenture, other governing documents or law) for
all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes
pursuant to the requisite provisions of such indenture or other governing
documents or (B) take any actions reasonably requested by Parent that are
customary or necessary to facilitate the redemption, defeasance, satisfaction
and/or

 



      
 

 



 

discharge of the Existing Notes pursuant to the applicable section of such
governing documents, and shall redeem, defease or satisfy and/or discharge, as
applicable, such series in accordance with the terms of such governing
documents at the Effective Time; _provided_ , that any such redemption,
defeasance, satisfaction and/or discharge must be conditioned on the
occurrence of the Closing and shall be required only to the extent such
condition is permitted by the documents governing the applicable debt
securities. Parent shall only request the Company to conduct any transaction
contemplated by this _Section 5.11(d)(ii)_ in compliance with the documents
governing the applicable debt securities and applicable federal securities
Laws. The Company, and its counsel, shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review documentation with respect to any redemption, defeasance, satisfaction
and/or discharge of the Existing Notes before it is distributed to holders of
the Existing Notes or filed with the SEC, as applicable, and Parent and Merger
Sub shall give due consideration to any reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by the Company or its counsel. Parent shall ensure
that, at the Effective Time, the Company has all funds necessary in connection
with any such redemption, defeasance, satisfaction and/or discharge. Parent
acknowledges that the consummation of any redemption, defeasance, satisfaction
and/or discharge of the Existing Notes is not a condition to Closing.

 



 

(e) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and other
Representatives, from and against any and all liabilities, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred in connection with their cooperation with the
arrangement, syndication and consummation of the Debt Financing, the Debt
Tender Offers and any redemption, defeasance, satisfaction and/or discharge of
the Existing Notes pursuant to this _Section 5.11_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not apply in the Companys or its Subsidiaries, or
any of their respective Representatives, willful misconduct or gross
negligence. Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for all documented
out-of-pocket third party costs and expenses incurred by the Company in
connection with its cooperation pursuant to this _Section 5.11_.

 



 

(f) Parent acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the Financing is not a
condition to Closing.

 



 

5.12 _Parent Agreements Concerning Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all actions
necessary or advisable to cause Merger Sub to perform its covenants,
agreements and obligations under this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof. Parent shall, promptly following execution of this Agreement, approve
and adopt this Agreement in its capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub and
deliver to the Company evidence of its vote or action by written consent
approving and adopting this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law and
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub.

 



 

5.13 _Takeover Statutes_. If any state takeover Law or state Law that purports
to limit or restrict business combinations or the ability to acquire or vote
Shares (including any "control share acquisition," "fair price," "business
combination" or other similar takeover Law) becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company and the Company
Board shall take all action reasonably available to it to render such Law
inapplicable to the foregoing.

 



      
 

 



 

5.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Shares
(including derivative securities with respect to Shares) resulting from the
Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

5.15 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent reasonable
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors and officers relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger ("
_Transaction Litigation_ "), and no such settlement of any Transaction
Litigation shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The
Company shall promptly notify Parent of any Transaction Litigation and shall
keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the status
thereof.

 



 

5.16 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. The Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Companys securities to be de-listed from the NYSE and de-registered under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, and
prior to the Effective Time the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent
with respect thereto.

ARTICLE 7 ** 
TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER**

 



 

7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to
the Effective Time, by action taken or authorized by the board of directors of
the terminating party or parties:

 



 

(a) By mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 



 

(b) By either the Company or Parent, if the Company Stockholder Approval shall
not have been obtained upon a vote taken at the Company Meeting duly convened

(c) By either the Company or Parent, if any Governmental Entity shall have
issued an Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting,
prior to the Effective Time, the consummation of the Merger, and such Order
shall have become final and non-appealable or any Law enacted or promulgated
by any Governmental Entity is in effect that prevents or makes illegal the
consummation of the Merger; _provided_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)_ shall not be available to a party
if the issuance of, or failure to resolve or have vacated or lifted, such

agreements under this Agreement, including pursuant to _Section 5.5_;

 



 

(d) By either the Company or Parent if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or before January 26, 2017 (the " _Initial Outside Date_ ");

conditions in _Article 6_ other than _Sections 6.1(b)_ or _6.1(c)_ have
been satisfied (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but which shall then be capable of satisfaction if the Closing

occurred prior to the Outside Date.

 



 

(e) By Parent, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, if the Company Board shall have effected a Change of Board
Recommendation, whether or not in compliance with _Section 5.3_ (it being
understood and agreed that any written notice of the Companys intention to
make a Change of Board Recommendation prior to effecting such Change of Board

and of itself) result in Parent or Merger Sub having any termination rights
pursuant to this _Section 7.1(e)_); provided, that Parents right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(e)_ shall expire at
5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the 15th calendar day following the date on

Company shall have entered into, a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that such termination
pursuant to this _Section 7.1(f)_ shall not be effective and the Company

(g) By Parent, at any time prior to the Effective Time, if: (i) there has been
a breach by the Company of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, in each case, such that any condition
to the Merger contained in _Sections 6.3(a)_ or _6.3(b)_ is not reasonably
capable of being satisfied while such breach is continuing, (ii) Parent shall
have delivered to the Company written notice of such breach and (iii) such
breach is not capable of cure in a manner sufficient to allow satisfaction of
the conditions in _Sections 6.3(a)_ and _6.3(b)_ prior to the applicable
Outside Date or at least 30 days shall have elapsed since the date of delivery
of such written notice to the Company and such breach shall not have been
cured; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(g)_ if Parent or
Merger Sub is then in material breach of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

 



 

(h) By the Company, at any time prior to the Effective Time, if: (i) there has
been a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of its representations,

such breach shall not have been cured; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 7.1(h)_ if the Company is then in material breach of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement; or

 



 

(i) By the Company, if: (i) the Marketing Period has ended and all of the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.3_ have been satisfied
or waived (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but which shall then be capable of satisfaction if the Closing
were to occur on such date), (ii) the Company has delivered an irrevocable
written notice to Parent stating that, if Parent performs its obligations

period after delivery of such notice by the Company, Parent shall not be

7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 7.1_, written notice
thereof shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is made and the basis
therefor described in reasonable detail, and this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no further force and effect (other than the second
sentence of _Section 5.2(b)_, _Section 5.11(e)_, _Section 7.2_, _Section
7.3_, _Section 7.4_, _Section 7.5_ and _Article 8_, each of which shall
survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their
respective Subsidiaries, officers, directors, Representatives or affiliates,
whether arising before or after such termination, based on, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution, performance or
subject matter hereof (whether in contract, tort or otherwise, or whether at
law (including at common law or by statute) or in equity); _provided_ , that,
subject to _Section 7.3_ and _Section 7.4_ (including the limitations on
liability contained therein), nothing herein shall relieve any party from
liabilities or damages incurred or suffered as a result of a Willful and
Material Breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination.

 



 

7.3 _Company Termination Fee_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto agree that if this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_ or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_,
then the Company shall pay to Parent prior to or concurrently with such
termination, in the case of a termination by the Company, or within two
Business Days thereafter, in the case of a termination by Parent, the Company
Termination Fee. The " _Company Termination Fee_ " means $8,000,000; provided,
however, that if the Company terminates this agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(f)_ prior to the Solicitation Period End Date or with respect to an
Exempted Person, then the Company Termination Fee means $4,000,000.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto agree that if (x) this Agreement is terminated by the
Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ or by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(g)_ (solely with respect to a breach of a covenant or
agreement), (y) an Acquisition Proposal has been

 



       
 

 



 

publicly announced or made to the Company after the date hereof and not
withdrawn (i) in the case of termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_, prior
to the date of such termination, or (ii) in the case of termination pursuant
to _Section 7.1(b)_, prior to the date of the Company Meeting, and (z) the
Company enters into a Company Acquisition Agreement or consummates an
Acquisition Proposal within twelve months after such termination, then the
Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent upon consummation of
such Acquisition Proposal, and such amount, if any, paid pursuant to this
_Section 7.3(b)_ shall be reduced by the amount paid, if any, pursuant to
_Section 7.3(c)_. For purposes of this _Section 7.3(b)_, the term "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
_Section 5.3(i)(i)_, except that the references to "20%" shall be deemed to
be references to "50%".

 



 

(c) The parties hereto agree that if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(g)_ (solely with respect to a breach of a
covenant or agreement), then the Company shall pay to Parent the reasonable
costs, fees and expenses incurred by Parent, its affiliates and their
Representatives in connection with the investigation, due diligence,
negotiation and documentation of this Agreement, such amount not to exceed
$1,300,000 in the aggregate. In the event the foregoing payment is paid to
Parent and the Company Termination Fee thereafter becomes payable pursuant to
_Section 7.3(b)_, the Company Termination Fee otherwise payable shall be
reduced by the amount of such payment previously paid to Parent pursuant to
this _Section 7.3(c)_.

 



 

(d) All payments under this _Section 7.3_ shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent, or
in the absence of such designation, an account established for the sole
benefit of Parent.

 



 

(e) Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that (i) the agreements
contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of
this Agreement under circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is
payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the
amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ are not a penalty but rather
constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent and Merger Sub for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iii) without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay
the Company Termination Fee when due, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company
for the Company Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent, together
with the Company Termination Fee, (A) interest on the Company Termination Fee
from the date of termination of this Agreement at a rate per annum equal to
the Prime Rate and (B) Parents costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) in connection with such Proceeding. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



 

(f) In circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is payable in
accordance with _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_, Parents receipt of
the Company Termination Fee (if received) from or on behalf of the Company
shall be Parents and Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Subs sole and exclusive remedy (whether based in contract, tort or strict
liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable
proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws or
otherwise) against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current or future direct or indirect equity holders,
general or limited partners, controlling persons, stockholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates or assignees
(collectively, the " _Company Related Parties_ ") for all losses and damages
suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, for any breach or failure to
perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, no such
Person shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

7.4 _Parent Termination Fee_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that (i) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ or _Section 7.1(i)_, then Parent shall pay to
the Company, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within
two (2) Business Days) following such termination, $12,000,000 (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ ").

 



 

(b) All payments under this _Section 7.4_ shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Company, or in the absence of such designation, an account established for the
sole benefit of the Company.

 



 

(c) Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that (i) the agreements
contained in this _Section 7.4_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of
this Agreement under circumstances where the Parent Termination Fee is payable
are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts
payable pursuant to this _Section 7.4_ are not a penalty but rather
constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the
Company for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
(iii) without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent fails to pay the Parent
Termination Fee when due, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company
commences a Proceeding that results in a judgment against Parent for the
Parent Termination Fee, Parent shall pay to the Company, together with the
Parent Termination Fee, (A) interest on the Parent Termination Fee from the
date of termination of this Agreement at a rate per annum equal to the Prime

8.6 _Headings_. The headings and table of contents contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision (or part thereof) of this
Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy,
all other terms, conditions and provisions (or parts thereof) of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision (or part thereof) is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law and in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated
hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

8.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits and Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Guaranty and the other documents delivered pursuant
hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of
the parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written
and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject
matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein or therein,
are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
hereunder or thereunder.

 



 

8.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in whole
or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of each of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

 



 

8.10 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, other
than pursuant to _Section 5.9_, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Financing Parties
shall be express third party beneficiaries of and have the right to enforce
_Sections 7.5_ , _7.6(b)_ , _8.10_ , and _8.12(d)_.

 



 

8.11 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_. Each party has jointly participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if

include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall

 



      
 

 



 

include masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words

provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive. As

and words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement. Any Contract or Law defined or
referred to herein means any such Contract or Law as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, unless otherwise specifically indicated.

 



 

8.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement and all claims and causes of action based upon, arising out
of or in connection herewith shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to Laws that may be

Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such Court does not have
jurisdiction, any Delaware State court, or Federal court of the United States
of America, sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in
any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such Proceeding except in such
courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such Proceeding may be
heard and determined in such court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may

forum to the maintenance of such Proceeding in any such court. Each of the
parties agrees that a final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in _Section 8.3_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH OR THE

 



      
 

 



 

TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 8.12(c)_.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party agrees (i)
that any action of any kind or nature, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise, against a Financing Party in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby shall be brought exclusively in any New York state or federal court
and each party submits for itself and its property with respect to any such
action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (ii) that service of
process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at its
address provided in _Section 8.3_ shall be effective service of process
against it for any such action brought in any such court, (iii) to waive and
hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
Proceeding in any such court, (iv) that a final judgment in any such
Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law, (v) that the Laws
of the State of New York shall govern any such Proceeding and (vi) to
irrevocably waive and hereby waives any right to a trial by jury in any such
action to the same extent such rights are waived pursuant to _Section
8.12(c)_.

 



 

8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission each of
which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto
and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof
signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement
shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder
(whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall be
sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

8.14 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at Law would
exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and accordingly, subject to
the limitations set forth in _Section 8.14(b)_, prior to the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1_, (i) the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to specific performance of the terms hereof, (ii) the parties waive any
requirement for the securing

 



      
 

 



 

or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any specific
performance or injunctive relief and (iii) the parties will waive, in any
action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law.
The Companys or Parents pursuit of specific performance at any time will not
be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other
right or remedy to which such party may be entitled, including the right to
pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by the other
party in the case of a breach of this Agreement involving a Willful and
Material Breach.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of _Section 8.14(a)_, it is
explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to specific performance
of Parents obligation to enforce the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter
against the investment funds party thereto and to cause the Equity Financing
to be funded in order to fund the transactions contemplated hereby and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, solely if,
following the Marketing Period, (i) all of the conditions set forth in
_Sections 6.1_ and _6.3_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions to Closing that by their terms or their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being satisfied assuming a
Closing would occur), (ii) Parent fails to complete the Closing by the date
the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.2_, (iii) the
Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing, and (iv) the Company has delivered an
irrevocable written notice to Parent stating that, if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the
Company will take all actions that are within its control to cause the Closing
to occur. For purposes of clarity, in no event will any party be entitled to
enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents obligation to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or
will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, while the
Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance to the extent
permitted by this _Section 8.14_ and the payment of monetary damages in
connection with this Agreement or any termination hereof, including all or any
portion of the Parent Termination Fee, under no circumstances shall the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance pursuant to this _Section 8.14_ and payment of any monetary
damages in connection with this Agreement or any termination hereof, including
all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee.
