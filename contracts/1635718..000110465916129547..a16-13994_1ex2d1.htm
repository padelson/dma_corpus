Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). All capitalized terms used
in this Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in _Section
8.4_ or as otherwise defined elsewhere in this Agreement unless the context
clearly indicates otherwise.

A. The Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Company by the Parent, the Parent shall cause the Purchaser to (and the

promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) a tender offer (as it may be
amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ")
to purchase any and all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock,
par value $0.00001 per share, of the Company (the " _Shares_ "), at a price
per Share of $4.60 (such amount or any higher amount per Share that may be
paid pursuant to the Offer, the " _Offer Price_ "), payable net to the seller
in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

D. As soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with

F. The board of directors of the Purchaser has, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein, (i) determined that the transactions

conditions set forth herein, approved and declared advisable this Agreement

H. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of the Parent and the Purchaser to
enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company, solely in
their respective capacities as stockholders of the Company, are entering into

the Merger, and also to prescribe various conditions with respect to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and the covenants,
premises, representations and warranties and agreements contained in this
Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound,
the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE 1 ** 
THE OFFER AND THE MERGER**

 



 

1.1 _The_ _Offer_.

 



 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Article 7_, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than July
11, 2016) after the date hereof, the Purchaser shall (and the Parent shall
cause the Purchaser to) commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act, the Offer to purchase for cash any and all Shares at the Offer
Price. The Purchaser shall, and the Parent shall cause the Purchaser to,
accept for payment, purchase and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, subject only to: (i) there being
validly tendered in the Offer (in the aggregate) and not properly withdrawn
prior to the Expiration Date that number of Shares (other than Shares tendered
by guaranteed delivery where actual delivery has not occurred) that,

 



      
 

 



 

together with the number of Shares (if any) then owned by the Parent or the
Purchaser, represent at least a majority of the Shares then issued and
outstanding (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include the Company
Restricted Shares) (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and (ii) the satisfaction,
or waiver by the Parent or the Purchaser, of the other conditions and
requirements set forth in _Annex I_.

 



 

(b) On or prior to the date that the Purchaser becomes obligated to pay for
Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Parent shall provide or cause to be provided
to the Purchaser on a timely basis funds sufficient to purchase and pay for
any and all Shares that the Purchaser shall become obligated to accept for
payment and purchase pursuant to the Offer. Subject to the satisfaction of the
Minimum Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by the Parent or the
Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_ ,
the Purchaser shall accept for payment (the time of such acceptance, the "
_Acceptance Time_ ") and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable following the
Expiration Date, and, in any event, no more than two Business Days after the
Expiration Date. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid to the
seller in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes as
provided in _Section 2.6_, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in
accordance with applicable Law and this Agreement, including the conditions
and requirements set forth in _Annex I_. To the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the Parent and the Purchaser expressly reserve the right to increase the
Offer Price or to make any other changes to the terms and conditions of the
Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that except with the prior written consent of
the Company, the Parent and the Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer
Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii)
reduce the maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iv)
amend, modify or waive the Minimum Condition or the conditions set forth in
_clauses (c)(i)_ or _(c)(ii)_ of _Annex I_ , (v) amend any of the other
conditions set forth in _Annex I_ in a manner adverse to the holders of
Shares, (vi) impose conditions to the Offer that are in addition to the
conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex I_ hereto, (vii) except as
provided in _Sections 1.1(e)_ and _1.1(f)_ , terminate, accelerate, extend or
otherwise modify or amend the Expiration Date, or (viii) otherwise modify or
amend any of the other terms of the Offer in a manner adverse in any material
respect to the holders of Shares.

 



 

(d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer
shall expire at 12:00 midnight (New York City time) on the date that is twenty
(20) Business Days following the commencement of the Offer (determined in
accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) (such date and time,
the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, if the Initial Expiration Date has been
extended in accordance with this Agreement, the date and time to which the
Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later date
and time to which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance
with this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ ").

 



 

(e) If on any then scheduled Expiration Date, any of the conditions to the
Offer (including the Minimum Condition and the other conditions and
requirements set forth

 



      
 

 



 

in _Annex I_ ) have not been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by the
Parent or the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, waived by the Parent or
the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall (and the Parent shall cause the Purchaser
to) extend the Offer and the Expiration Date to a date that is not more than
ten (10) Business Days after such previously scheduled Expiration Date (the
length of such extension to be determined by the Parent in its sole
discretion), or such longer period as may be agreed by the parties, in order
to permit the satisfaction of such conditions to the Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer
beyond October 25, 2016 (the " _Initial Outside Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_further_ , in the event that at the Initial Outside Date, all of the
conditions to the Offer other than the Minimum Condition and the HSR Condition
have been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by the Parent or the Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement, have been waived by the Parent and the Purchaser,
the Initial Outside Date shall be extended to December 24, 2016 (the "
_Extended Outside Date_ "). In addition, the Purchaser shall extend the Offer
for any period or periods required by applicable Law or applicable rules,
regulations, interpretations or positions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or its staff or NASDAQ.

 



 

(f) The Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Article 7_. If this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article 7_, the Purchaser shall
(and the Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours following such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any Shares pursuant thereto. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by the Purchaser, or this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article 7 _prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Purchaser shall (and the Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) promptly return,
and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of the Purchaser to return, in
accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof and the Purchaser shall not (and the Parent shall cause the Purchaser
not to) accept any Shares pursuant to the Offer.

 



 

(g) As promptly as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer,
the Parent and the Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule
14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits,
the Offer to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal, a form of summary
advertisement and a form of notice of guaranteed delivery (collectively,
together with any amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Offer
Documents_ "). The Company consents to the inclusion of a description of the
Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents. The
Parent and the Purchaser agree to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated
to holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by federal securities
Laws, including the Exchange Act. The Parent and the Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly notify the other
party and correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents, if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable
Law, and the Purchaser agrees to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected,
to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case,
as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. So long as the Company
Board has not effected a Change of Board Recommendation, the Company and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable

 



      
 

 



 

opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they are
filed with the SEC, and the Parent and the Purchaser shall give due
consideration to any additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the
Company and its counsel (it being understood that the Company and its counsel
shall provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable). In
addition, so long as the Company Board has not effected a Change of Board
Recommendation, the Parent and the Purchaser shall provide the Company and its
counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall provide them a written
summary of any oral comments, that the Parent and the Purchaser or its counsel
may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments,
and any written or oral responses thereto. So long as the Company Board has
not effected a Change of Board Recommendation, the Company and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such responses and the
Parent and the Purchaser shall give due consideration to the reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its
counsel (it being understood that the Company and its counsel shall provide
any comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable).

 



 

1.2 _Company Actions_.

 



 

(a) Contemporaneous with, or as promptly as practicable (but in no event later
than three (3) days) after, the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall,
in a manner that complies with the rules and regulations promulgated by the
SEC under the Exchange Act, including Rule 14d-9 thereunder, file with the SEC
a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that shall, subject to the provisions of
_Section 5.3_, contain the Company Board Recommendation and include in the
Schedule 14D-9, in its entirety, the Fairness Opinion, together with a summary
thereof in customary form, and a notice, in compliance with Section 262 of the
DGCL, of appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under the DGCL. The
Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, as and when required by applicable Laws, including the Exchange Act.
If requested by the Purchaser and reasonably practicable, the Company shall
cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed or otherwise disseminated to the holders
of Shares together with the Offer Documents disseminated to the holders of
Shares. The Parent and the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, agree to promptly notify the other party and correct any
information included in, or incorporated by reference into, the Schedule
14D-9, if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law,
and the Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case, as and
to the extent required by federal securities Laws, including the Exchange Act.
So long as the Company Board has not effected a Change of Board
Recommendation, the Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with
the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Parent, the Purchaser
and their counsel (it being understood that the Parent, the Purchaser and
their counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably
practicable). In addition, so long as the Company Board has not effected a
Change of Board Recommendation, the Company shall provide the Parent, the
Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall
provide them with a written summary of any oral comments, that the

 



      
 

 



 

Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments,
and any written or oral responses thereto. So long as the Company Board has
not effected a Change of Board Recommendation, the Parent, the Purchaser and
their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such
written responses and the Company shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Purchaser
and its counsel (it being understood that the Parent, the Purchaser and their
counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable).

 



 

(b) From time to time as reasonably requested by the Purchaser or its agents,
the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Purchaser mailing
labels, security position listings, non-objecting beneficial owner lists and
any other listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of the
record or beneficial holders of the Shares as of the most recent practicable
date, and shall promptly furnish the Purchaser with such information
(including updated lists of holders of the Shares and their addresses, mailing
labels, security position listings and non-objecting beneficial owner lists)
and such other assistance as the Purchaser or its agents may reasonably
request in communicating with the record and beneficial holders of Shares. In
addition, in connection with the Offer, the Company shall cooperate with the
Purchaser to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares held in or
subject to any Company Equity Plan, and to permit such holders of Shares to
tender Shares in the Offer. Subject to any and all Laws, and except for such
steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Merger, the Parent and the Purchaser and
their agents shall: (i) hold in confidence the information contained in any
such lists of stockholders, mailing labels and listings, computer files or
files of securities positions in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, (ii) use such information only in connection with the Offer and the
Merger, and (iii) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article 7_,
the Parent and the Purchaser shall dispose of all such information in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

1.3 _The_ _Merger_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of the Purchaser shall cease, and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ "). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises of the Company and the Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and
the Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(b) The Merger shall be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL and
shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. The parties agree to take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as
practicable following the Acceptance Time, without a meeting of stockholders
of the Company in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated, so
as to read in its entirety in the form set forth as _Exhibit A_ hereto, and
as so amended and restated shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law. In addition, the Company and the Surviving Corporation
shall take all necessary action such that, at the Effective Time, the bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated, so as to read in
its entirety in the form set forth as _Exhibit B_ hereto, and as so amended
and restated shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the
necessity of further action by the Company, the directors of the Purchaser
immediately prior to the Effective Time or such other individuals designated
by the Parent as of the Effective Time shall become the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified,
or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. From and
after the Effective Time, except as determined by the Parent, the officers of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(e) If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills
of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the
Company or the Purchaser acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement, then the officers and directors of
the Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or the Purchaser, all
such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments and
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such
corporation or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be lawful
and necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right,
title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.

 



 

(f) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, if at any
time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, any change in the outstanding Equity Interests of the Company shall
occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), subdivision or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any dividend or distribution with a record date
during such period, the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration will be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

 



      
 

 



 

1.4 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ ") will take place at 7:00 a.m., Pacific Time, on a date to be
specified by the parties (such actual date as the Closing takes place, the "
_Closing Date_ "), such date to be no later than the second Business Day after
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all of the
applicable conditions set forth in _Article 6_ (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction of such conditions or waiver by the party entitled to waive such
conditions), at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 355 South Grand Avenue,
Los Angeles, California 90071, unless another time, date or place is agreed to
in writing by the parties hereto. At the Closing, the Company shall execute
and file a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger
shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, or such later date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and
specified in the Certificate of Merger (such date and time hereinafter
referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

ARTICLE 2 ** 
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER**

 



 

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Parent, the Purchaser, the Company
or their respective stockholders:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of_ _Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Cancelled Shares and except for
Dissenting Shares, shall be cancelled and, other than Cancelled Shares,
Dissenting Shares and Shares irrevocably accepted for payment in the Offer,
shall be converted automatically into the right to receive the Offer Price,
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable net to the holder
in cash, subject to any withholding of Taxes as provided in _Section 2.6_,
upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
_Section 2.2_.

 



 

(b) _Cancelled Shares_. All Shares that are held in treasury of the Company or
by any Company Subsidiary (in each case, other than any such Shares held on
behalf of third parties) or held by Parent, Purchaser or any direct or
indirect subsidiary of Parent or Purchaser, in each case immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Cancelled Shares_ "), shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

 



 



 

(c) _Purchaser Equity Interests_. All outstanding Equity Interests of the
Purchaser held immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become (in the aggregate) one hundred (100) shares of newly and validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01,
of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of_ _Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall
designate and select a reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying
agent (the identity

 



      
 

 



 

and terms of designation and appointment of which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company) for purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger
Consideration in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). The
Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the Paying
Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which holders of Shares (other than Cancelled Shares and
except for Dissenting Shares) shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant
to this Agreement (such deposited cash shall be referred to in this Agreement
as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund is insufficient to
make the payments contemplated pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, the Parent shall
promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent such
additional funds to ensure that the Paying Agent has sufficient funds to make
such payments. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than
to fund payments pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, except as expressly provided
for in this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent
as directed by the Parent, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof by
the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any such investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United
States government or rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investor Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, and in accordance with
the terms of the agreement executed to engage the services of the Paying
Agent. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property
of the Parent, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of
holders of Shares.

 



 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than three Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares
represented by certificates (the " _Certificates_ "), which Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form as the Parent and the Paying Agent
shall reasonably agree; and (B) customary instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) to the Paying Agent
or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Parent, and upon
delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with
respect to such Certificates, the holder of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificates (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.6_), any Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment
shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not required to be paid.

 



      
 

 



 

No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender
of the Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by
this Agreement, except for Certificates representing Dissenting Shares, which
shall be deemed to represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of
such Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of
the DGCL.

 



 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Shares represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall be required to deliver a Certificate or,
in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust
Company, an executed letter of transmittal, to the Paying Agent to receive the
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-
Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company whose Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall
automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and the Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time, in respect of each such Book-Entry Share a cash
amount in immediately available funds equal to the Merger Consideration (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.6_),
and such Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than three
Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a holder of record of Book-Entry Shares not held through The
Depository Trust Company: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall be in such
form as the Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B)
customary instructions for returning such letter of transmittal in exchange
for the Merger Consideration. Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal, in
accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Merger
Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.6_), and such Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to
Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or surrendered as
contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Book-Entry
Shares representing Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed to represent the
right to receive payment of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with
and to the extend provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in_ _Shares_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective

 



      
 

 



 

Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect
thereto) made available to the Paying Agent that remains unclaimed by the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, upon request by the Parent, will be returned to the Parent or
an affiliate thereof designated by the Parent, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not tendered its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_ prior to such time
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof for
delivery of the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any
withholding of Taxes as provided in _Section 2.6_, in respect of such
holders surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance
with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_. Any Merger Consideration remaining
unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become
property of, any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Parent or an affiliate thereof
designated by the Parent, free and clear of any claim or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their
respective affiliates will be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. The
Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the
payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in a reasonable sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary (but subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.3_), Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in
accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the
DGCL (such Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration but rather shall be entitled
only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting
Shares. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the "fair value" of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws
or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other
applicable Law, then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the date of
loss of such status, each of such shares shall

 



      
 

 



 

automatically be converted into or shall have deemed to have been, at the
Effective Time, converted into, as applicable, and shall represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, in accordance with _Section
2.1(a)_, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes as provided
in _Section 2.6_, following the surrender of the Stock Certificate(s) or
Book-Entry Shares representing such shares. The Company shall give the
Purchaser prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Shares and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the fair value of
Dissenting Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of the Purchaser, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle or compromise, any such demands, or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

2.4 _Treatment of Options, Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
option to purchase Shares (each, a " _Company Option_ ") under any stock
option or other equity or equity-based plan of the Company, including the
Amended and Restated ReachLocal, Inc. 2008 Stock Incentive Plan, the
ReachLocal, Inc. Director Stock Plan, the ReachLocal, Inc. 2004 Stock Plan, or
any other plan, agreement or arrangement (the " _Company Equity Plans_ "),
that is unexpired and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not vested, shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each
former holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to
receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option and in
settlement therefor, a payment in cash (subject to any applicable withholding
or other Taxes as provided in _Section 2.6_) of an amount equal to the
product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to such cancellation and (ii) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to such cancellation (such amounts payable hereunder
being referred to as the " _Option Payments_ "). No holder of a Company Option
that has an exercise price per Share that is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration shall be entitled to any payment with respect to such
cancelled Company Option. On or as soon as practicable following the Closing,
but in any event no later than fifteen (15) days following the Closing, (i)
the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid through its or an
Affiliates payroll system and subject to withholding, if any, as described in
_Section 2.6_ to each holder of one or more Company Options who is a current
or former employee of the Company, such holders Option Payment and (ii) the
Surviving Corporation shall make, or cause to be made, the payment of the
Option Payment to each holder of one or more Company Options who is not a
current or former employee of the Company.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Shares_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall cause all awards of restricted Shares heretofore granted
under any Company Equity Plan that have not heretofore vested (" _Company
Restricted Shares_ ") to become fully vested and without further restrictions
with respect to ownership rights thereto, thereby causing all Company
Restricted Shares to become unrestricted Shares that are converted into the
right to receive, at the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration as provided
in _Section 2.1(a)_.

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each outstanding award of restricted stock units granted under any
Company

 



      
 

 



 

Equity Plan (each a " _Company RSU Award_ "), whether or not vested, shall be
cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled
Company RSU Award shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the
cancellation of such Company RSU Award and in settlement therefor, a payment
in cash (subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes as provided in
_Section 2.6_) of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of
Shares subject to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to such
cancellation and (ii) the Merger Consideration (such amounts payable hereunder
being referred to as the " _RSU Payments_ "). As soon as practicable following
the Closing, but in any event no later than fifteen (15) days following the
Closing, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid through
its or an Affiliates payroll system and subject to withholding, if any, as
described in _Section 2.6_ to each holder of one or more Company RSU Award
who is a current or former employee of the Company, such holders RSU Payment
and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall make, or cause to be made, the
payment of the RSU Payment to each holder of one or more Company RSU Awards
who is not a current or former employee of the Company.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Company Equity Plans_. As of the Effective Time, all
Company Equity Plans shall be terminated and no further Shares, Company
Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company RSU Awards, Company Securities or
other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder.

 



 

(e) _Board Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take all other actions necessary and appropriate (including obtaining any
required consents) to effect the transactions described in this _Section
2.4_.

 



 

2.5 _Treatment of Warrant_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Warrant shall (to the extent unexercised at such time) be deemed to be
automatically exercised in accordance with the Warrant Agreement and the
holder thereof shall receive as consideration for the cancellation of the
Company Warrant and the termination of the Warrant Agreement a payment in cash
by the Surviving Corporation on the Closing Date, and in any event immediately
after the Effective Time, of an amount equal to the product of (a) the total
number of Shares underlying the Company Warrant immediately prior to such
cancellation and (b) the lesser of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration per Share over the exercise price per Share underlying the
Company Warrant immediately prior to such cancellation and (ii) $2.55 (the "
_Warrant Payment_ "). From and after the Effective Time, the Company Warrant
shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only
entitle such holder to the payment of the Warrant Payment, if any. The Warrant
Payment shall constitute the sole consideration payable in respect of the
canceled Company Warrant and no additional consideration shall be paid in
respect of the canceled Company Warrant.

 



 

2.6 _Withholding Rights_. The Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts
that the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of
applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Entity by the Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying

 



       
 

 



 

Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 



 

ARTICLE 3 ** 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

Except as set forth in (i) the Company SEC Documents (but excluding any
forward-looking disclosures set forth in any risk factor section, any
disclosure in any section relating to forward-looking statements or any other
disclosures included in any such form, report, schedule, statement or other
document to the extent they are predictive or forward-looking in nature);
_provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing _clause (i)_ shall not apply to the
representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.3_ ,
_3.4_ , _3.5_ , _3.21_ , _3.23_ , _3.24_ , and _3.25_ , or (ii) the disclosure
schedule delivered by the Company to the Parent and the Purchaser concurrent
with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ")
(in each case it being understood that any information set forth in one
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to
apply to and qualify the representation and warranty set forth in this
Agreement to which it corresponds in number and, whether or not an explicit
reference or cross-reference is made, each other representation and warranty
set forth in this _Article 3_ for which it is reasonably apparent on its face
that such information is relevant), the Company hereby represents and warrants
to the Parent and the Purchaser as follows:

 



 

3.1 _Organization and Qualification;_ _Subsidiaries_.

 



 

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Subsidiary_
") is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept)
under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and
has all requisite corporate or organizational, as the case may be, power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to conduct
its business as it is currently being conducted. The Company and each Company
Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation or other
entity, and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize
such concept) under the Laws of each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing
or operation of its properties or assets or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The Company has made available or caused to be made available to the
Purchaser true, complete and correct copies of (i) the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended through and in effect
as of the date hereof (the " _Company Charter_ "), (ii) the Amended and
Restated Bylaws of the Company, as amended through and in effect as of the
date hereof (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), and (iii) the certificates of
incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational or governing documents,
of each Company Subsidiary.

 



 

(c) _Section 3.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) a
true, correct and complete list of the Company Subsidiaries as of the date of
this Agreement, together with the jurisdiction of organization or
incorporation, as the case may be, of each

 



      
 

 



 

Company Subsidiary and (ii) a true, correct and complete list of the issued
and outstanding Equity Interests of each Company Subsidiary and the owner of
such Equity Interests. There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to provide funds to, or make any investment
(in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Company
Subsidiary that is not wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company
(in excess of $250,000) or any other Person, other than guarantees by the
Company of any indebtedness or other obligations of any wholly owned Company
Subsidiary.

 



 

3.2 _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 140,000,000
Shares, of which, as of the close of business on June 20, 2016 (the "
_Capitalization Date_ "), (A) there were 30,096,787 Shares issued and
outstanding and (B) no Shares were held by the Company in its treasury, and
(ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of
the Company (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "), of which no shares of Company
Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding. No Company Subsidiary owns any
Shares or has any option or warrant to purchase Shares or any other Equity
Interest in the Company or any other Company Securities.

 



 

(b) As of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, the Company has no
Shares or shares of Company Preferred Stock subject to or reserved for
issuance, except for (i) 7,944,575 Shares subject to outstanding Company
Options under the Company Equity Plans, (ii) 1,000,000 Shares subject to the
Company Convertible Notes, (iii) 300,000 Shares underlying the Company
Warrant, (iv) 184,500 Shares subject to outstanding Company RSU Awards under
the Company Equity Plans and (v) 1,908,065 Shares reserved for future issuance

hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Parent and the Purchaser, and assuming due and valid authorization, execution
and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legally valid and binding
obligation of the Parent and the Purchaser, enforceable against the Parent and

be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar Laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors rights, and to general equitable principles, including
specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief).

Subsidiary pursuant to, any Contract, permit or other instrument or obligation
to which the Parent, the Purchaser or any Parent Subsidiary is a party or by
which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or
affected, except, with respect to clauses (b) and (c), for any such conflicts,
violations, consents, breaches, losses, defaults, other occurrences or Liens

be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

otherwise permitted to be taken under _Section 5.1_ of this Agreement, and
will cause such person to respond, on behalf of the Parent, to the Companys
requests as promptly as practicable. If the Company desires to take an action
which would be prohibited pursuant to this _Section 5.1_ without the written
consent of the Parent, prior to taking such action the Company may request
such written consent by sending an e-mail or facsimile, pursuant to _Section
8.3_ of this Agreement, to each such individual as designated by the Parent.
An approval of either such individual shall constitute an approval of the
Purchaser to the taking of an action otherwise specifically proscribed under
this _Section 5.1_ of this Agreement.

 



 

5.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time and
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 7_, the Company
shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to: (i) provide to the Parent
and the Purchaser and their respective Representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably
with the operation of any business conducted by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, upon reasonable advance written notice to the Company, to the
officers, employees, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company
and each Company Subsidiary and to the books and records thereof, and (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to furnish such information concerning the
business, properties, Contracts, Company Permits, assets and liabilities of
the Company and each Company Subsidiary as the Parent or the Parent
Representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be required to (or to cause any Company Subsidiary to)
afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that in the
reasonable, good-faith judgment of the Company would: (A) result in the loss
of attorney-client privilege (but the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that
does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege), (B) result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets of Third Parties or violate any obligations of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to confidentiality to any
Third Party or otherwise breach, contravene or violate any then effective
Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party (
_provided_ that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at
Parents request and expense, to obtain the required consent of such Third
Party to provide such access or disclosure), (C) allow for environmental
sampling of soil, indoor air, or groundwater or (D) breach, contravene or
violate any applicable Law (including Competition Laws); _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that, if any such access or disclosure is limited for
the reasons described in clauses (A)(C) above, the Parent and the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at Parents expense, to establish a
process that (through use of steps such as targeted redactions, provision of
information to counsel to review and summarize for the Parent or use of a
"clean room" environment for

 



      
 

 



 

analysis and review of information by joint integration teams in coordination
with counsel and the Company) will provide the Parent with timely access to
the fullest extent possible to the substance of the information described in
this _Section 5.2(a)_.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parent and the Purchaser agrees that it will not, and will
cause its Representatives not to, prior to the Effective Time, use any
information obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ for any competitive or
other purpose unrelated to the consummation of the Transactions. The
Confidentiality Agreement, dated February 19, 2016, by and between the Parent
and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), shall apply with
respect to information furnished under this _Section 5.2_ by the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries and their Representatives. Prior to the Closing, each of
the Parent and the Purchaser shall not, and shall cause their respective
Representatives not to, outside of the ordinary course of business, contact or
otherwise communicate with the employees (other than members of the Companys
senior leadership team), customers, suppliers, distributors, labor unions,
landlords, lessors, banks or other lenders of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, or, except as required pursuant to _Section 5.4_, any
Governmental Entity, regarding the business of the Company, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 



 

5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.3(b)_, from and after the date hereof until the
Acceptance Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article 7_, the Company shall not, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries not to, and shall instruct the Company Representatives
not to on behalf of the Company: (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage
or knowingly induce the submission of any Acquisition Proposal or engage in
any discussions or negotiations or furnish or disclose any nonpublic
information with respect thereto, or knowingly take any other action designed
and intended to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal which
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal (other than informing any Third Party of the existence of the
provisions contained in this _Section 5.3_ and _provided_ , _that_ , the
Company may ascertain facts from any Third Party making an Acquisition
Proposal for the purpose of the Company Board informing itself about such
Acquisition Proposal and the Third Party making it) or (ii) terminate, amend,
modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality, standstill or similar
agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party and which
would otherwise prohibit, delay or impair the ability of any Person to make an
Acquisition Proposal (each a " _Restrictive Agreement_ "). The Company shall,
and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct the Company
Representatives to on behalf of the Company, immediately cease and terminate
any discussion or negotiation with any Third Party conducted prior to the date
hereof by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of the Company
Representatives on behalf of the Company with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, or any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, and shall request to have returned promptly to the
Company any confidential information that has been provided in any such
discussions or negotiations to the extent contemplated by any confidentiality
agreement with such Third Party. The Company represents and warrants to Parent
that neither it nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has granted any waiver or
release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of
equity securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

if at any time following the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time (i)
the Company has received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal from a
Third Party, (ii) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of
this _Section 5.3_ and (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, based on
information then available, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that, after
consultation with outside counsel, failing to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law, then the Company may (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal, its Representatives and
potential sources of financing, (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such
Acquisition Proposal and (C) terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision
of any Restrictive Agreement; _provided_ that the Company (x) will not, and
will cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, and will instruct the Company
Representatives not to on behalf of the Company, disclose any nonpublic
information to such Third Party without first entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such Third Party and (y) will provide to the
Parent, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours), any
material nonpublic information concerning the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries provided or made available to such other Person which was not
previously provided or made available to the Parent.

 



 

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly (and
in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify the Parent after receipt by
the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry that could reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide such
notice in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the material
terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company
shall keep the Parent reasonably informed of the status of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and shall promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) provide to the Parent a copy of such Acquisition
Proposal (or, where no such copy is available, a reasonable description of
such Acquisition Proposal) and copies of all material written correspondence
and written materials sent or provided to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary that describes any material terms or conditions of any Acquisition
Proposal (as well as written summaries of any oral communications addressing
the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal).

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in _Sections 5.3(e)_ and _5.3(f)_ , neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, nor shall the Company Board or
any committee thereof authorize the Company to, (i) withdraw or withhold,
amend, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to the Parent or the Purchaser
the Company Board Recommendation or publicly propose to do any of the
foregoing, (ii) approve, adopt, or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) following the date any Acquisition Proposal or any
material modification thereto is first made public, sent or given to the
stockholders of the Company, fail to issue a press release that expressly
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days
following the Parents written request to do so, (iv) fail to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9, or (v) except as expressly
permitted by this Agreement, cause or permit the Company to enter into any
contract, letter of intent, memorandum of

 



      
 

 



 

understanding, or agreement in principle regarding or providing for any
Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate, materially delay or fail to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any action
described in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), whether taken by the
Company Board or any committee thereof, or by the Company with the
authorization of the Company Board or any committee thereof, being referred to
as a " _Change of Board Recommendation_ ").

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.3_,
if, at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company has received a _bona
fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that does not result from a breach of this
_Section 5.3_, and the Company Board determines, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel, that the Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and that failing to take action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law, the Company Board may at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) effect a Change of Board Recommendation with
respect to such Superior Proposal and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal,
subject to the requirements of this _Section 5.3(e)_ and _Section 7.2_. The
Company shall not be entitled to effect a Change of Board Recommendation
pursuant to this _Section 5.3(e)_ or terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal pursuant to this
_Section 5.3(e)_ and _Section 7.1(e)_ unless the Company shall have provided
to the Parent at least four (4) Business Days prior written notice (the "
_Notice Period_ ") of the Companys intention to take such action, which
notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, and shall have provided to the Parent a copy of the available
proposed transaction agreement to be entered into in respect of such
Acquisition Proposal in each case, to the extent not previously specified or
provided to the Parent, and:

 



 

(i) during the Notice Period, if requested by the Parent, the Company shall
have, and shall have caused its legal and financial advisors to have, engaged
in good faith negotiations with the Parent regarding any amendment to this
Agreement proposed in writing by the Parent and intended to cause the relevant
proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 



 

(ii) the Company Board shall have considered any adjustments and/or proposed
amendments to this Agreement (including a change to the price terms hereof)
and the other agreements contemplated hereby that may be proposed in writing
by the Parent (the " _Proposed Changed Terms_ ") no later than 11:59 a.m., New
York City time, on the last day of the Notice Period and shall have determined
in good faith that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal if such Proposed Changed Terms were to be given effect.

 



 

In the event of any material revisions to such Superior Proposal offered in
writing by the party making such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to the Parent and to again comply
with the requirements of this _Section 5.3(e)_ with respect to such new
written notice, except that the Notice Period shall be two (2) Business Days
with respect to any such revised Superior Proposal, but no such new written
notice shall shorten the original Notice Period.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.3_,
the Company Board may at any time prior to the Acceptance Time effect a Change
of Board Recommendation if (i) the Company Board determines that an
Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation in response to such
Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;
_provided_ that (x) the Company Board has provided to the Parent at least four
(4) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the circumstances related to
such determination, (y) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested
by the Parent, the Company shall have, and shall have caused its legal and
financial advisors to have, engaged in good faith negotiations with the Parent
regarding any Proposed Changed Terms proposed in writing by the Parent, such
that the failure to make a Change of Board Recommendation would not reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the Companys fiduciary duties to its
stockholders under applicable Law and (z) the Company Board shall have
considered the Proposed Changed Terms no later than 11:59 a.m., New York City
time, on the last day of such four (4) Business Day period and shall have
determined in good faith that the failure to make a Change of Board
Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable law if
such Proposed Changed Terms were given effect.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of
the Company if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law. The issuance by the Company or
the Company Board of a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of
its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation.

 



 

5.4 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
the Company, the Parent and the Purchaser shall use (and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable, (ii) take such actions as may be required to cause
the expiration of the notice periods under Competition Laws with respect to
such transactions as promptly as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, (iii) obtain, and maintain, from any Governmental Entities any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders
necessary or required to be obtained by the Parent, the Purchaser or the
Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries in order to effect the
Closing as promptly as practicable (and in any event, by no later than the
Extended Outside Date), and to take all reasonable or necessary actions to
avoid any action or

 



      
 

 



 

proceeding by any Governmental Entity (including those in connection with
Competition Laws), in connection with the authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, (iv) cause the
satisfaction of all conditions set forth in _Annex I_ and _Article 6_, (v)
vigorously defend all lawsuits or other legal, regulatory or other proceedings
or Orders to which it is a party or otherwise challenging or affecting this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including seeking to have any stay, injunction or temporary
restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or
reversed prior to the Extended Outside Date, (vi) as promptly as practicable,
make or cause to be made all necessary applications and filings (and in any
event file all required HSR Act notifications no later than July 11, 2016 and
request early termination of the HSR waiting period thereunder), and
thereafter make any other required submissions, and pay any fees due in
connection therewith (all such fees to be solely the responsibility of, and to
be paid by, the Parent and the Purchaser), with respect to this Agreement, the
Offer and the Merger required under any Competition Laws, and (vii) as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, make all necessary
filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, and pay any fees
due in connection therewith, with respect to this Agreement, the Offer and the
Merger required under any Competition Laws and any other applicable Law. The
Company, the Parent and the Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in all
respects in connection with (x) preparing and filing the Offer Documents, the
Schedule 14D-9 and any Other Filings, (y) determining whether any action by or
in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required, in
connection with the consummation of the Offer or the Merger and (z) seeking
any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings.
The Company and the Parent shall furnish to each other all information
required for any application or other filing under the rules and regulations
of any applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. No party to this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary extension
of the Offer or delay of the Closing at the behest of any Governmental Entity
without the consent of the other parties to this Agreement, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. From the date of
this Agreement until the Effective Date unless terminated prior to such time,
neither the Parent nor the Purchaser shall, directly or indirectly through one
or more of their respective affiliates, unless consented to in writing by the
Company, take any action, including acquiring or making any investment in any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other business
organization or any division or assets thereof, that would reasonably be
expected to cause a material delay in the satisfaction of the conditions
contained in _Annex I_ or _Article 6_ or the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger, it being understood that Parents pursuit of the investments described
in _Section 5.4(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to
be an action that would reasonably be expected to have such effect. Without
limiting this _Section 5.4(a)_, the Parent agrees to take, or cause to be
taken, any and all steps and to make, or cause to be made, any and all
undertakings necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any antitrust, merger control, competition, or trade regulation Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer or the Merger
so as to enable the Acceptance Time and the Closing, respectively, to occur as
promptly as practicable (and in any event, no later than the Extended Outside
Date), including (A) proposing, negotiating, committing to, and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
licensing or disposition of any assets, properties or businesses of the Parent
or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or (B) accepting any
operational restrictions or

 



       
 

 



 

otherwise taking or committing to take actions that limit the Parents or any
Parent Subsidiarys freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain, any of the assets, properties, licenses, rights, product lines,
operations or businesses of the Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in each case, as may be required in order to avoid the entry of,
or to effect the lifting or dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order, or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Acceptance Time or the
Closing, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this sentence
shall require the Parent to take any step or make any undertaking the effect
of which would be to materially diminish the value of the business of the
Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries),
taken as a whole. In addition, the Parent shall use its best efforts to defend
through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in
order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing from
occurring as promptly as practicable (and in any event, no later than the
Extended Outside Date).

 



 

(b) The Company and the Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to Third Parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Third Party consents, approvals or waivers identified on _Schedule 5.4(b)_
and the Company and the Purchaser shall coordinate and cooperate in seeking
any such consents, approvals or waivers.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.4_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the
making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer or
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
(ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the
other parties of any communication to or from any Governmental Entity
regarding the Offer or the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate
with the other parties and will consider in good faith the views of the other
parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation,
memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in
connection with the Offer or the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, except as may be prohibited by
any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding, each party hereto will permit
authorized Representatives of the other parties to be present at each meeting
or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any
document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in
connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding.
Nothing in this _Section 5.4_ will apply to or restrict communications or
other actions by the Company, the Parent or the Purchaser and their respective
affiliates with or with respect to any Governmental Entity in connection with
their business in the ordinary course of business.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Parent or the
Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of the Company prior to the consummation of the Merger. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall

 



      
 

 



 

exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
unilateral control and supervision over its business operations.

 



 

5.5 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article 7_, unless prohibited by applicable Law, each party
hereto shall promptly notify the other parties hereto if any of the following
occur after the date of this Agreement: (a) receipt of any notice or other
communication in writing from any Governmental Entity or Person alleging that
the consent or approval of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Offer, Merger or any of the transactions hereunder; (b) receipt of
any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity or NASDAQ (or
any other securities market) in connection with the transactions hereunder; or
(c) upon such party becoming aware of the occurrence of an event that could
prevent or delay beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the transactions
hereunder or that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article 6_ or _Annex I_ not being
satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 5.5_ shall not cure any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit
or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice;
_provided_ , further, that any failure to make such notice (in and of itself)
shall not be taken into account in determining whether the conditions set
forth in _Annex I_ have been satisfied or give rise to any right of
termination set forth in _Article 7_.

 



 

5.6 _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, the Parent
and the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, shall not
issue any press release or make any public statement with respect to the
Offer, the Merger or this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except (a) as may be required by applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange or regulatory
or governmental body to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the
party required to make the release or announcement shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on
such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, or (b) with respect
to any press release or other public statement by the Company permitted by
_Section 5.3_. The press release announcing the execution and delivery of
this Agreement shall be a joint release of, and shall not be issued prior to
the approval of each of, the Company and the Parent. The Company shall (i)
file a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC attaching its press release and
copy of this Agreement as exhibits and (ii) file a pre-commencement
communication on Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC attaching its press release. The
Parent and the Purchaser shall file a pre-commencement communication on
Schedule TO with the SEC attaching the press release.

 



 

5.7 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time and for a period ending one year
following the Effective Time, the Parent shall either (i) assume and maintain,
or cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to
assume and maintain, for the benefit of the employees of the Company and
Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Acceptance Time (each a "
_Continuing Employee_ "), the Benefit Plans (other than the Company Equity
Plans) at the benefit levels in effect on the date of this Agreement and
provide or cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation,
to provide compensation and benefits (other

 



      
 

 



 

than equity compensation) to each Continuing Employee under the Company
Benefit Plans or other employee benefit plans or compensation arrangements of
the Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries that have a target value that is
reasonably comparable in the aggregate to the target value of the compensation
and benefits provided to such Continuing Employee under the Benefit Plans
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time (other than equity compensation); or
(ii) (A) provide or cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to provide compensation (other than equity compensation) to each
Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, has a target value that is
reasonably comparable in the aggregate to the target value of the compensation
(other than equity compensation) provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time and (B) provide or cause the Parent
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to provide benefits to each
Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, have a value that is reasonably
comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Acceptance Time.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.7(a)_, from and after the
Effective Time, the Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, to, assume, honor and continue during the
one-year period following the Effective Time or, if sooner, until all
obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all of the Companys employment,
severance, retention and termination plans, policies, programs, agreements and
arrangements (including any change in control or severance agreement between
the Company and any Continuing Employee), in each case, as in effect at the
Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights
arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either
alone or in combination with any other event), without any amendment or
modification, other than any amendment or modification required to comply with
applicable Law or as consented to by the parties thereto.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.7(a)_, the Surviving
Corporation shall allow the Companys senior management team to reasonably
determine the level of payments to Continuing Employees pursuant to the
Companys incentive plans, as described on _Section 5.7(c_) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, with respect to the annual performance period in which
the Effective Time occurs; provided that the Companys senior management team
shall consult with and obtain the consent of Parent prior to making any final
determination of the level of payment under such plans.

 



 

(d) With respect to benefit plans maintained by the Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, that are offered to
the Continuing Employees for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate and vesting (but not level of benefits, benefit accruals or early
retirement subsidies), each Continuing Employees service with the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, as reflected in the Companys records, shall be
treated as service with the Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation to the same extent such service was
recognized under the Companys comparable Benefit Plan; _provided_ , _however_
, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in any duplication of benefits.

 



 

(e) The Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) to, waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, evidence of insurability, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting

 



      
 

 



 

periods under any medical benefit plan maintained by the Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees (and their eligible
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time,
except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been
satisfied or waived under the comparable Benefit Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, to recognize, or cause to be recognized,
the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses
incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents)
during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of
satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations under the
relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee (and
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

 



 

(f) Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be credited to such
Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and shall not be subject to
accrual limits or other forfeiture.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything provided in this _Section 5.7_, each employee of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary who, as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, is covered by a collective bargaining or similar labor-related
agreement shall be provided with compensation and benefits consistent with the
terms of the applicable agreement in effect.

 



 

(h) Nothing contained herein, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon
any Continuing Employee any benefits under any benefit plans, programs,
policies or other arrangements, including severance benefits or right to
employment or continued employment by reason of this Agreement. In addition,
the provisions of this Agreement are for the sole benefit of the parties to
this Agreement and are not for the benefit of any third party.

 



 

5.8 _Indemnification of_ _Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending six (6) years
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and the Parent shall (i)
indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors, officers and
employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (collectively, the "
_Covered Persons_ ") to the same extent such Covered Persons are indemnified
as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Company
Charter, the Company Bylaws, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or
equivalent organizational or governing documents, of any Company Subsidiary,
as applicable, and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the
date of this Agreement with any directors, officers and employees of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary arising out of acts or omissions in their
capacity as directors, officers or employees of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (ii) advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) incurred in the defense of any Proceeding or investigation with
respect to the matters subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Section
5.8(a)_ in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Company Charter,
the Company Bylaws, the

 



      
 

 



 

certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational
documents, of any Company Subsidiary, as applicable, and indemnification
agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Covered Person to whom expenses are advanced shall
undertake to repay such advanced expenses to the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, if it is ultimately determined by a final non-appealable judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Covered Person is not entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 5.8(a)_. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made
against such Covered Person with respect to matters subject to indemnification
hereunder on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
provisions of this _Section 5.8(a)_ shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 



 

(b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification of and advancement of expenses to Covered Persons for periods
at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company
Charter and the Company Bylaws. Following the Effective Time, the
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement
with any Covered Person shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation, without
any further action, and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms.

 



 

(c) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain for the benefit of the Companys directors and
officers, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time, an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is
substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate than the Companys existing policy (true and complete copies which
have been previously made available to the Purchaser) or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;
except, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium
paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement, but in such case
shall purchase as much coverage as is available for such amount. The
provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been
satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time,
which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an
aggregate period of at least six (6) years with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid
policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

 



 

(d) In the event the Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) The obligations under this _Section 5.8_ shall not be terminated or
modified in any manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (and their
respective successors and assigns) to whom this _Section 5.8_ applies (i)
unless such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (ii)
without the consent of such affected Covered Person (or their respective
successors and assigns) (it being expressly agreed that the Covered Persons
(including successors and assigns) shall be Third Party beneficiaries of this
_Section 5.8_). In the event of any breach by the Surviving Corporation or
the Parent of this _Section 5.8_, the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, including attorneys fees,
that may be incurred by Covered Persons in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this _Section 5.8_ as such fees are incurred upon the
written request of such Covered Person.

 



 

5.9 _Parent Agreements Concerning the Purchaser_. The Parent hereby guarantees
the due, prompt and faithful payment, performance and discharge by the
Purchaser of, and the compliance by the Purchaser with, all of the covenants,
agreements, obligations and undertakings of the Purchaser under this Agreement
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and covenants and agrees to
take all actions necessary or advisable to ensure such payment, performance
and discharge by the Purchaser hereunder. The Parent shall, immediately
following execution of this Agreement, approve and adopt this Agreement in its
capacity as sole stockholder of the Purchaser and deliver to the Company
evidence of its vote or action by written consent approving and adopting this
Agreement in accordance with applicable Law and the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Purchaser.

 



 

5.10 _Takeover Statutes_. If any state takeover Law or state Law that purports
to limit or restrict business combinations or the ability to acquire or vote
Shares (including any "business combination" or other similar takeover Law)
becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, the Parent or the
Purchaser, the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, then the Company and the Company Board shall take all action
reasonably available to it to render such Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

 



 

5.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a "covered
person" of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_") of Shares, Company Options
or Company RSU Awards pursuant to this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger
shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.

 



 

5.12 _Company Indebtedness_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall
take all such actions as are necessary and appropriate to obtain at the
Acceptance Time pay-off letters in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Parent evidencing the amount (the " _Pay-off Amount_ ") necessary to pay-off,
at the Acceptance Time, all existing indebtedness and other obligations
(including outstanding letters of credit and any costs, fees, expenses,
premiums, prepayment penalties, breakage fees or other exit fees payable in
connection with the pay-off of the existing indebtedness and other
obligations) under (a) the Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of April 30,
2015, by and among the Company, certain Company Subsidiaries, Hercules
Technology Growth Capital, Inc., as administrative agent, and the lenders
party thereto from

 



       
 

 



 

time to time, as amended (the " _Credit Agreement_ ") and (b) the Company
Convertible Notes. At or prior to the Acceptance Time, the Parent shall pay,
or shall cause to be paid, on behalf of the Company, the Pay-off Amount to an
account or accounts designated by the administrative agent under the Credit
Agreement and the holder of the Company Convertible Notes, as applicable.

 



 

5.13 _Stockholder Litigation_. Subject to any fiduciary duties of the board of
directors of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and except as
would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, jeopardize any privilege,
the Company shall consult with the Parent in the Companys defense or
settlement of any stockholder litigation (other than any litigation or
settlement where the interests of the Company or any of its affiliates are
adverse to those of the Parent, the Purchaser or any of their respective
affiliates) against the Company and/or any of its directors or executive
officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided
that the Company shall not settle, compromise or enter into an agreement
regarding any settlement or compromise of any stockholder litigation relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than any settlement
solely for monetary damages paid entirely from proceeds of insurance, except
for any applicable deductible) requiring the payment of any amount, acceptance
of any liability, or admission of any violations of Law by the Company or
Company Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the Parent (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

ARTICLE 6 ** 
CONDITIONS TO CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER**

 



 

6.1 _Conditions to Obligations of Each Party Under This_ _Agreement_. The
respective obligations of each party to consummate the Merger shall be subject
to the satisfaction (or waiver, if permissible under Law) at or prior to the
Effective Time of each of the following conditions:

 



 

(a) The Purchaser shall have irrevocably accepted for purchase, or caused to
be irrevocably accepted for purchase, all Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn in the Offer; and

 



 

(b) The consummation of the Merger shall not then be restrained, enjoined or
prohibited by any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) of a
court of competent jurisdiction or any other Governmental Entity and there
shall not be in effect any statute, rule or regulation enacted, promulgated or
deemed applicable to the Merger by any Governmental Entity that prevents the
consummation of the Merger.

 



 

ARTICLE 7 ** 
TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER**

 



 

7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned by action
taken or authorized by the board of directors of the terminating party or
parties:

their respective boards of directors, at any time prior to the Acceptance
Time;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) By either the Company or the Parent, if the Offer (as it may have been
extended pursuant to _Section 1.1_) expires as a result of the non-
satisfaction of any condition to or requirement of the Offer set forth in
_Annex I_ in a circumstance where the Purchaser has no further obligation to

8.6 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

 



 

8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

8.8 _Entire_ _Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, Parent
Disclosure Schedule and Company Disclosure Schedule and the other documents
delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior and contemporaneous
agreements (except the Confidentiality Agreement) and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, are
not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder.

 



 

8.9 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by
operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other
parties; _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that the Parent or the Purchaser may
transfer or assign its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement,
in whole or from time to time in part, to one or more of its affiliates, but
no such assignment shall relieve the Parent or the Purchaser of its
obligations hereunder.

 



 

8.10 _No_ _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than any
Persons entitled to indemnification under the provisions of _Section 5.8_
(Indemnification of Directors and Officers), with respect to such provisions.
The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto without notice or liability to any
other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with

 



      
 

 



 

particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of the parties hereto,
and consequently, may not accurately characterize actual facts or
circumstances.

 



 

8.11 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_. Each party hereto has participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender
shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall
include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include

limitation." Any reference to any Governmental Entity include any successor to
the Governmental Entity and to any affiliate include any successor to the
affiliate. Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to
"Sections," "Exhibits," "Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended to refer to
Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to this
Agreement. The schedules and exhibits attached to this Agreement constitute a
part of this Agreement and are incorporated herein for all purposes. The words
"hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and words of similar
import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular section or article in which such words appear.
Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be
deemed to be exclusive. The words "will" and "shall" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall mean a command. All references in
this Agreement to "$" are intended to refer to U.S. dollars. Whenever the last
day for the exercise of any right or the discharge of any duty under this
Agreement falls on a day other than a Business Day, the party having such
right or duty shall have until the next Business Day to exercise such right or
discharge such duty. Unless otherwise indicated, the word "day" shall be
interpreted as a calendar day. With respect to any determination of any period
of time, unless otherwise set forth herein, the word "from" means "from and
including" and the word "to" means "to but excluding."

 



 

8.12 _Governing_ _Law ; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement and all claims and causes of action arising in connection
herewith shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to Laws that may be applicable under
conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding with
respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising in connection
herewith, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of
this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by any
other party hereto or its successors or assigns, will be brought and
determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State

 



      
 

 



 

of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with
regard to any such Proceeding for itself and in respect of its property,
generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
Proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of
the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in
accordance with this _Section 8.12_, (ii) any claim that it or its property
is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted
by the applicable Law, any claim that (A) the Proceeding in such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Proceeding is improper
or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or
by such courts. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to
this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for notices in _Section 8.3_ and agrees that service made in such
manner shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such party
personally within the State of Delaware. Nothing in this Agreement will affect
the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
8.12(c)_.

 



 

8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission each of
which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto
and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof
signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement
shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder
(whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

(in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF format or by
facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement.

 



 

8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at Law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and accordingly, (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specific
performance of the terms hereof, in each case in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any state or
federal court of the United States of America having jurisdiction, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in
equity, (b) the parties waive any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with the obtaining of any specific performance or
injunctive relief, (c) the parties will waive, in any action for specific
performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law and (d) the seeking of
remedies pursuant to this _Section 8.14_ shall not in any way constitute a
waiver by any party seeking such remedies of its right to seek any other form
of relief that may be available to it under this Agreement, including under
_Section 7.2_, in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the
event that the remedies provided for in this _Section 8.14_ are not available
or otherwise are not granted and (d) nothing set forth in this Agreement shall
require a party to institute any proceeding for (or limit a partys right to
institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section 8.14_
prior, or as a condition, to exercising any termination right under _Article
7_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement
of any legal proceeding seeking remedies pursuant to this _Section 8.14_ or
anything set forth in this _Section 8.14_ restrict or limit a partys right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article 7_ or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter.

Agreement to a condition or requirement being satisfied shall be deemed to be
satisfied if such condition or requirement is so waived. The failure by the
Parent or the Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights
shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.

 _FOURTH_ : The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall
have authority to issue is one hundred (1,00) shares of Common Stock, each

Delaware, as the By-Laws may provide. The books of the Corporation may be kept

the outstanding stock of the Corporation.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 **DIRECTORS**

 



 

SECTION 1. NUMBER AND TERM  The business and affairs of the Corporation shall

SECTION 3. VACANCIES  If the office of any director becomes vacant, the
remaining directors in the office, though less than a quorum, by a majority
vote, may appoint any qualified person to fill such vacancy, who shall hold
office for the unexpired term and until his or her successor shall be duly
chosen.

 



 

SECTION 4. REMOVAL  Except as hereinafter provided, any director or directors

election of directors, at an annual meeting or a special meeting called for
the purpose.

 



 

SECTION 5. COMMITTEES  The Board of Directors may, by resolution or
resolutions passed by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, designate
one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more directors of
the Corporation.

 



 

Except as may be limited by the laws of the State of Indiana, any such
committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors,
or in these By-Laws, shall have and may

      
 

 



 

exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the
management of the business and affairs of the Corporation.

 



 

SECTION 6. MEETINGS  Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held
without notice at such places and times as shall be determined from time to
time by resolution of the Board of Directors.

by the Secretary on the written request of any director, on at least one days
notice to each director (except that notice to any director may be waived in
writing by such director) and shall be held at such place or places as may be
determined by the Board of Directors, or as shall be stated in the notice of
the meeting.

 



 

Members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of
Directors, may participate in any meeting of the Board of Directors or any
committee thereof by means of a conference telephone or similar communications
equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear
each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in
person at the meeting.

 



 

SECTION 7. QUORUM  A majority of the Directors shall constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business. If at any meeting of the Board of Directors there
shall be less than a quorum present, a majority of those present may adjourn
the meeting from time to time until a quorum is obtained, and no further
notice thereof need be given other than by announcement at the meeting which
shall be so adjourned. The vote of the majority of the Directors present at a
meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of
Directors unless the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or these
By-Laws shall require the vote of a greater number.

 



 

SECTION 8. COMPENSATION  Directors shall not receive any stated salary for
their services as directors or as members of committees, but by resolution of
the Board of Directors a fixed fee and expenses of attendance may be allowed
for attendance at each meeting. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to
preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity as an
officer, agent or otherwise, and receiving compensation therefor.

 



 

SECTION 9. ACTION WITHOUT MEETING  Any action required or permitted to be
taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may
be taken without a meeting if a written consent thereto is signed by all
members of the Board of Directors or of such committee, as the case may be,
and such written consent is filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board
of Directors or such committee.

indemnify and hold harmless, to the extent permitted by applicable law as it
presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any employee or agent of the
Corporation who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is
otherwise involved in any Proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she, or
a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was an employee
or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation

extent not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys
fees) incurred by any officer or director of the Corporation, and may pay the
expenses incurred by any employee or agent of the Corporation, in defending

to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the
final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking by the person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be
ultimately determined that the person is not entitled to be indemnified under
this Article V or otherwise.

 



 

SECTION 4. DETERMINATION; CLAIM  If a claim for indemnification (following
the final disposition of such Proceeding) or advancement of expenses under

claim therefor has been received by the Corporation the claimant may file suit
to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in
part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim to
the fullest extent permitted by law. In any such action the Corporation shall
have the burden of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the requested
indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable law.

 



 

SECTION 5. INDEMNIFICATION CONTRACTS  The Corporation is authorized to enter
into a contract with any director, officer, employee or agent of the

Directors so determines, greater than, those provided for in this Article V.

 



 

SECTION 6. NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS  The rights conferred on any person by
this Article V shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person

of Incorporation, these By-Laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise.

director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, enterprise or non-profit entity against any liability
asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity,
or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the
provisions of the DGCL.

      
 

 



 

SECTION 8. OTHER INDEMNIFICATION  The Corporations obligation, if any, to
indemnify or advance expenses to any person who was or is serving at its
request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,

advancement of expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, enterprise or non-profit enterprise.

 



 

SECTION 9. CONTINUATION OF INDEMNIFICATION  The rights to indemnification and
to prepayment of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article V
shall continue notwithstanding that the person has ceased to be a director or
officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the estate,
heirs, executors, administrators, legatees and distributees of such person.

 



 

SECTION 10. AMENDMENT OR REPEAL  The provisions of this Article V shall
constitute a contract between the Corporation, on the one hand, and, on the
other hand, each individual who serves or has served as a director or officer
of the Corporation (whether before or after the adoption of these By-Laws), in
consideration of such persons performance of such services, and pursuant to
this Article V the Corporation intends to be legally bound to each such
current or former director or officer of the Corporation. With respect to
current and former directors and officers of the Corporation, the rights
conferred under this Article V are present contractual rights and such rights
are fully vested, and shall be deemed to have vested fully, immediately upon
adoption of these By-Laws. With respect to any directors or officers of the
Corporation who commence service following adoption of these By-Laws, the
rights conferred under this provision shall be present contractual rights and
such rights shall fully vest, and be deemed to have vested fully, immediately
upon such director or officer commencing service as a director or officer of
the Corporation. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of
this Article V shall not adversely affect any right or protection (i)
hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to
the time of such repeal or modification or (ii) under any agreement providing
for indemnification or advancement of expenses to an officer or director of
the Corporation in effect prior to the time of such repeal or modification.
