right to obtain, at Purchasers sole cost and expense, any
desired endorsements to the Title Policy which are available (provided the
Title Companys agreement to issue any endorsements other than those set forth

hereunder). 

4.07 _Conveyance of Title_. At the Closing, if requested by the Title Company,
Seller and Operating Lessee shall execute an owners affidavit in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit "M"_ (the "Owners Affidavit") and a gap

(a) Not less than ten (10) days prior to Closing, Purchaser may direct the
Title Company to update the Title Commitment to, as closely as possible, the

such update identifies any matters other than the Scheduled Encumbrances
(such matters, the "Additional Exceptions"), Seller shall have three (3)



 

20 days from receipt of Purchasers notice in which to remove such Additional
Exceptions (or to commit at that time to remove them at Closing). Purchasers
objections to the Additional Exceptions (the "Additional Permitted
Objections") may not include any item deemed a Scheduled Encumbrance, and any
objections based on an update of the Existing Survey shall be limited to
matters:

(i) shown on or due to the updated Existing Survey that would have an adverse
affect on the operation, use or value of the Property, and

(ii) that were not caused by or through Purchaser.

at or prior to Closing all Additional Permitted Objections and shall remove
all Additional Permitted Objections which are removable by payment of an
ascertainable amount, as well as the Operating Lease. If Seller does not elect
to cure any Additional Exception which it is not obligated to cure, Purchaser
shall have the right to elect, in writing, at or prior to the Closing,
either:

(i) to terminate this Agreement, whereupon the Earnest Money shall be
disbursed to Purchaser and all obligations between Seller and Purchaser under
this Agreement will terminate except for those that expressly survive
termination, or

(ii) to accept title to the Property subject to such Additional Exception.

(c) If Seller does timely so cure the Additional Permitted Objections,
according to the terms hereof, then this Agreement shall continue in
effect. Purchaser shall have the right at any time to waive any Additional
Permitted Objections and thereby to preserve this Agreement in effect. The
Additional Exceptions, to the extent the Additional Exceptions are not the
subject of Purchasers Additional Permitted Objections or are waived by
Purchaser, and any matters caused by or through Purchaser, shall be included
in the Title Policy and deemed to be Scheduled Encumbrances.

4.09 _Estoppels and Consents to Assignment_. At Purchasers request, Seller
shall apply for estoppel certificates and/or consents to assignment with
respect to any Scheduled Encumbrances, Space Leases, Hotel Contracts,
Documents, Permits or Miscellaneous Hotel Assets and/or the Management
Agreement for which Purchaser desires an estoppel certificate or consent.
Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such estoppels
and consents. Seller shall promptly provide Purchaser with copies of all
correspondence with the parties from whom estoppel certificates and/or
consents are being requested. Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be required
to pay any amount in order to obtain the estoppels or consents referenced
hereinabove. The receipt of any such estoppel certificates or consents shall
not be deemed a condition to Closing and Purchaser shall have no right to
delay, defer or refuse to proceed to Closing based on the inability to obtain
any such estoppel certificates or consents; provided, however, that in the
event Purchaser is unable to obtain any such estoppel certificate or
consent, Seller shall provide Purchaser with an estoppel certificate based on
Sellers knowledge with respect to such facts as Purchaser may reasonably
request.

as provided below:

(a) To the extent possible, trade accounts payable (including amounts due

the full payment of any and all other trade accounts payable as of the Cut-off
Time.

Date, all payments due under the Management Agreement shall be prorated as of
the Cut-off Time. Without limitation of the foregoing, any incentive fees due
and payable under the Management Agreement for the calendar year in which
Closing occurs shall be prorated between Purchaser and Seller in the same
proportion as gross revenues accrue under the Management Agreement prior to
and after the Cut-off Time. As an example only, if for the calendar year in
which Closing occurs 75% of the gross revenues have accrued under the
Management Agreement as of the Cut-off Time, Seller shall be responsible for
75% of the incentive fees and Purchaser shall be responsible for 25% of the
incentive fees for such calendar year.

(e) All payments due under the Daily Grill Management Agreement shall be
prorated as of the Cut-off Time. Without limitation of the foregoing: (i) any
incentive fees due and payable under the Daily Grill Management Agreement for
the calendar year in which Closing occurs shall be prorated between Purchaser
and Seller in the same proportion as gross revenues accrue under the Daily
Grill Management Agreement prior to and after the Cut-off Time; and (ii) in
the event the Daily Grill Manager makes the payment described in Section 5 of
the Daily Grill Management Agreement, such payment shall be solely for the
benefit of Purchaser.

(f) All payments due under the Parking Services Agreement shall be prorated as
of the Cut-off Time. Without limitation of the foregoing, any incentive fees

under Bookings for Hotel facilities, (2) a percentage of any outstanding gift
certificates, which percentage shall be based upon the amount, age and
historic redemption rate of gift certificates at the Hotel, and (3)
commissions due to credit and referral organizations, to the extent
applicable after the Closing Date. Seller shall receive a credit for coin
machine, telephone, washroom, and checkroom income arising before the Cut-off
Time.

(h) Gas, electricity and other utility charges shall be apportioned at Closing
on the basis of the most recent meter reading occurring prior to Closing (but
subject to later readjustment as set forth below).

(i) Non-delinquent operational and/or occupancy taxes (unless amounts
attributable to the period prior to the Closing Date are paid directly by
Seller to the applicable taxing authority) shall be prorated as of the Cut-off
Time.

(j) Telephone and telex contracts and contracts for the supply of heat, steam,
electric power, gas, lighting and any other utility service shall be prorated
as of the Cut-off Time, with Seller receiving a credit for each deposit, if

the same is transferable and provided such deposit remains on deposit



 

33 for the benefit of Purchaser. Where possible, cut-off readings will be secured
for all utilities on the Closing Date.

if any, shall be prorated as of the Cut-Off Time. All security deposits shall

tenants under the Space Leases which is a percentage of the amount of sales or
of the dollar amount of sales), if any, payable under each Space Lease shall
be prorated with respect to the year thereunder in which Closing occurs on a
per diem basis. If the actual amounts to be prorated are not known as of
Closing, the prorations shall be made on the basis of the best evidence then
available. Within ninety (90) days after the end of the year in which Closing
occurs, Purchaser and Seller shall reconcile percentage rent for such year,
and upon such reconciliation, the parties shall make an adjusting payment
between themselves as appropriate. 

7.02 _Adjustment and Proration Procedures_. Notwithstanding anything contained
in the foregoing provisions:

(a) The Final Closing Statement (as defined in Section 7.06(a)) shall provide
for a credit to the account of Seller of all cash or other deposits posted
with utility companies serving the Property, to the extent the same are
transferable and provided such deposits remain on deposit for the benefit of
Purchaser.

(b) Any Property Taxes shall be prorated as of the Closing Date. Any such
proration made with respect to a tax year for which the tax rate or assessed
valuation, or both, have not yet been fixed shall be based upon the tax rate
and/or assessed valuation last fixed. To the extent that the actual Property
Taxes for the current year differ from the amount apportioned at Closing, the
parties shall make all necessary adjustments by appropriate payments
between themselves following Closing. All necessary adjustments shall be made
within fifteen (15) business days after the tax bill for the current year is
received. Any Property Taxes disputed with governmental authorities shall be
handled under Section 14.01(c).

electricity, gas, lighting and any other utility charges shall be prorated as

transferable and provided such deposit remains on deposit for the benefit of

on the Closing Date. As to gas, electricity and other utility charges, Seller
may, on notice to Purchaser, elect to pay one or more of all of said
items accrued to the date hereinabove fixed for apportionment directly to the
person or entity entitled thereto, and to the extent Seller so elects, such
item shall not be apportioned hereunder, and Sellers obligation to pay such
item directly in such case shall survive the Closing.



 

34 (d) As of the date immediately prior to the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser
shall jointly conduct or cause the Manager to conduct an inventory of all
Unopened Consumable Inventory on hand as of the Closing Date and shall deliver
a written report thereon to Seller and Purchaser. Such report shall reflect
the value of the Unopened Consumable Inventory on hand as of the Closing Date
at the acquisition cost thereof and shall be certified by Manager to Seller
and Purchaser as accurately reflecting all Unopened Consumable Inventory at
the Hotel as of the Closing Date and the acquisition cost thereof. Seller
shall receive a credit at Closing in an amount equal to the total value of the
Unopened Consumable Inventory as reflected in such inventory.

(e) At Closing, Seller shall receive (or receive a credit in an amount equal
to) all revenue (after the settlement of applicable commissions and/or costs)
relating to vending machines in the Hotel up until the Cut-off Time and
Purchaser shall receive a credit in the amount of any advance payments made to
Seller for vending machines to the extent attributable to any period after the
Cut-off Time.

(f) Revenues from the Hotel guest rooms and facilities occupied on the evening
immediately preceding the Closing Date, including any sales taxes, room taxes
and other taxes charged to guests in such rooms, all parking charges, sales
from mini-bars, in-room food and beverage, telephone, facsimile and data
communications, in-room movie, laundry and other service charges allocable to
such rooms, conferences, receptions, meetings, and other functions occurring
in any conference, banquet or meeting rooms in the Hotel or in any adjacent
facilities owned or operated by Seller or Operating Lessee, including usage
charges and related taxes, food and beverage sales, valet parking charges,
equipment rentals, and telecommunications charges, with respect to the evening
immediately preceding the Closing Date shall be divided equally between Seller
and Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all revenues from any bars and
lounges at the Property shall be prorated based on the actual closing time for
such bar or lounge. For example, if such bar or lounge closes at 2 a.m. on the
Closing Date, Seller shall retain the revenues from such services and
operations even if such revenues were generated two (2) hours after the Cut-
off Time.

(g) Purchaser shall receive a credit at Closing in an amount equal to one
hundred percent (100%) of all Deposits that shall have been received by or
credited to Seller prior to the Cut-off Time on account of reservations for
use or occupancy of the Property after the Cut-off Time. Any Deposits
received by Seller after the Cut-off Time on confirmed reservations after the
Cut-off Time will be deposited by Seller for Purchasers account with the
Manager or successor manager. For all purposes hereunder, Deposits and
similar items shall be deemed earned when occupancy or use occurs or is
scheduled to occur (and not when the Deposit was made).

(h) The parties acknowledge that certain taxes and assessments accrue and are
payable to the various local governments by any business entity operating a
hotel and its related facilities. Included in those taxes and assessments may
be business and occupation taxes, retail sales taxes, parking taxes, gross
receipts taxes, and other special lodging or hotel taxes and assessments. For
purposes of this Agreement, all of such taxes and assessments (expressly
excluding taxes and assessments covered elsewhere in this Agreement or
corporate franchise taxes, and federal, state and local income taxes) shall be
allocated between Seller and Purchaser



 

35 such that those attributable to the period prior to the Cut-off Time shall be
allocable to Seller and those attributable to the period after the Cut-off
Time shall be allocable to Purchaser (with the attribution of such taxes and
assessments hereunder to be done in a manner consistent with the attribution
under this Agreement of the applicable revenues on which such taxes and
assessments may be based). Seller shall be solely responsible for payment of
such taxes and assessments with respect to the period prior to the Cut-off
Time, and Purchaser shall be solely responsible for payment of such taxes
and assessments with respect to the period after the Cut-off Time. Seller
agrees to promptly file all necessary tax returns and forms with respect to
such taxes and assessments to the extent required by applicable law. Seller
shall indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless from and against any claims
arising from the failure to timely pay and discharge such taxes and
assessments with respect to the period prior to the Cut-off Time.

(i) Seller shall retain for its own account all Accounts Receivable. For a
period of three (3) months after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to collect, for the benefit of Seller,
Accounts Receivable which were due and owing to Seller prior to the Cut-off
Time. All payments shall be applied first as directed by the payor, then in
the inverse chronological order ( _i.e._ most recent first). In accordance
with the priority of the immediately preceding sentence, Purchaser shall remit
amounts so collected for the account of Seller to Seller by the tenth (10th)
day of the month following the month during which any such Accounts Receivable
due Seller were so collected. Purchaser shall have no obligation to commence
any action or proceeding to collect any such Accounts Receivable.

7.03 _Other_. Such other items as are provided for in this Agreement or as
are normally prorated and adjusted in the sale of a hotel shall be prorated as
of the Cut-off Time.

7.04  _Payment_. Any net credit due to Seller as a result of the adjustments
and prorations under Section 7.01 shall be paid to Seller in cash at the time
of Closing. Any net credit due to Purchaser as a result of the adjustments
and prorations under Section 7.01 shall be credited against the Purchase
Price at the time of Closing.

7.05 _Cash and Accounts_. At the Closing, Seller shall transfer to Purchaser
all Cash-On-Hand and Seller shall receive a credit at the Closing for such
Cash-On-Hand. All Account Cash is and shall remain the property of Seller and
shall either be retained by Seller at the Closing, or credited to Seller (to
the extent actually acquired by Purchaser) on the Final Closing Statement
(hereinafter defined).

7.06 _Closing Statements_.

(a) Preparation. Each party shall cause its designated representatives to
enter the Hotel only at reasonable times and without unreasonably interfering
with operations, both before and after the Closing Date, for the purpose of
making such inventories, examinations, and audits of the Hotel, and of the
books and records of the Hotel, as they deem necessary to make the
adjustments and prorations required under this Article VII, or under any other
provisions of this Agreement. Based upon such inventories, examinations, and
audits, at the Closing, the representatives of the parties shall jointly
prepare and deliver to each party a preliminary closing statement (the
"Preliminary Closing Statement") which shall show the net amount due either to
Seller or Purchaser as a result thereof, and such net amount will be added to



 

36 or subtracted from the payment of the Purchase Price to be paid to Seller
pursuant to Section 3.01 hereof. Within ninety (90) days following the
Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser shall agree on a final closing statement
(the "Final Closing Statement") setting forth the final determination of all
items to be included on the Final Closing Statement. The net amount due
Seller or Purchaser, if any, by reason of adjustments to the Preliminary
Closing Statement as shown in the Final Closing Statement, shall be paid in
cash by the party obligated therefor within ten (10) days following the date
of the Final Closing Statement.

(b) Disputes. In the event the representatives of the parties are unable
to reach agreement with respect to preparation of the Preliminary Closing
Statement then, except as hereinafter provided, the disputed amount shall be
held in a joint order Escrow, pending agreement of the parties or the
determination of the Accountants and the Closing shall occur. Purchaser shall
be required to deposit in the Escrow any additional sum of the disputed amount
which it may be required to pay. Any such dispute shall survive and be subject
to later resolution pursuant to this Section 7.06. In the event the
representatives of the parties are unable to reach agreement with respect to
either the Preliminary Closing Statement or the Final Closing Statement, the
parties shall submit their dispute to a firm of independent certified public
accountants of recognized standing in the hotel industry, which will certify
at the time of such dispute that it does not have a conflict. The following
are firms acceptable to the parties: Deloitte, Ernst and Young and
PricewaterhouseCoopers (the "Accountants"). To select the firm that will
resolve the dispute, the parties shall pick by random selection one of the
Accountants. Each party hereby represents and warrants that none of
the Accountants has a direct conflict as of the date of this Agreement,
although one or more of the Accountants has performed work for Seller and/or
Purchaser (or their respective Affiliates) in the past.

(c) Period for Recalculation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time
within six (6) months following the Closing Date, either party discovers any
items which should have been included in the Final Closing Statement but were
omitted therefrom, then such items shall be adjusted in the same manner as if
their existence had been known at the time of the preparation of the
Final Closing Statement. The foregoing limitations shall not apply to any
items which, by their nature, cannot be finally determined within the periods
specified.

7.07 _Assumed Liabilities_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 2.02), at Closing, Purchaser
shall assume, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller with
respect to, all liabilities (i) with respect to the Property to the extent

37 7.08 _Retained Liabilities_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 2.02), at Closing, Seller
shall retain, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser with
respect to, all liabilities (i) relating to the Property to the extent first
arising or accruing prior to the Closing, including, without limitation, (A)
liabilities to the extent accruing prior to the Closing under the Space

(a) Subject to conditions beyond Sellers reasonable control, Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause Manager to continue to operate,
maintain and manage the Hotel in substantially the same manner in which the
Hotel was operated, maintained, and managed immediately prior to the execution
of this Agreement.

(b) Seller will not (i) enter into any new Hotel Contract or Space Lease or
(ii) cancel, modify, or renew any existing Hotel Contract or Space Lease
affecting the Hotel in any material manner that is not cancelable upon thirty
(30) days without cause and without payment of any penalty, cost or
termination fee. If Purchaser fails to respond to a request for consent within
ten (10) days after receipt of such request, such consent will be deemed to
have been given. Purchaser may provide written notice to Seller, not later
than the date that is ten (10) days after the Effective Date, of any Hotel
Contracts which Purchaser wants Seller to terminate on or after the Closing
Date, provided that such Hotel Contracts may be terminated prior to expiration
of the term stated therein. If any Hotel Contract is not terminable prior to
the Closing Date pursuant to the terms thereof, such Hotel Contract (if it is
listed on _Exhibit "C"_ ) shall be assigned to Purchaser at Closing and the
payments and charges payable under such Service Contract shall be prorated as
provided in Sections 7.01 and 7.02 hereof. With respect to each Hotel
Contract Purchaser elects to terminate, Purchaser shall be charged at Closing
for any amounts payable to a third party contractor in order to terminate such
Hotel Contract pursuant to the applicable provisions thereof, and shall be
responsible to deposit all such amounts with Escrow Agent on or before the
Closing.



 

39 (c) Seller shall have the right, without notice to or consent of Purchaser, to
make Bookings in the ordinary course of business, at no less than the Hotels
standard rates including customary discounted rates.

(d) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve in force all
existing Permits and to cause all those expiring to be renewed prior to the
Closing Date. If any such Permit shall be suspended or revoked, Seller shall
promptly notify Purchaser and shall take all commercially reasonable measures
necessary to cause the reinstatement of such Permit. To the extent that the
consent of any governmental authority is required with respect to the transfer
of any Permit to Purchaser, Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser in seeking
and obtaining any such required consent.

(e) Seller will maintain and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause Manager to maintain in effect all policies of casualty and liability
insurance, or similar policies of insurance, with the same limits of coverage
now carried with respect to the Hotel.

ARTICLE XI

CASUALTIES AND TAKINGS 

11.01 _Casualties_.

(a) If any damage to the Property shall occur after the Effective Date and
prior to the Closing Date by reason of fire, windstorm, earthquake, hail,
explosion or other casualty, and if the cost to repair the Hotel is greater
than Two Million and No/100 Dollars ($2,000,000.00) as a result of such
casualty, Purchaser may elect to (i) terminate this Agreement by giving
written notice to Seller, whereupon the Earnest Money shall be disbursed to
Purchaser and all obligations between Seller and Purchaser under this
Agreement will terminate except for those that expressly survive termination;
or (ii) receive an assignment of all of Sellers rights to any insurance
proceeds (excluding (x) business interruption proceeds attributable to the
period prior to the Closing Date, which shall be retained by Seller, and (y)
any applicable deductible, which shall be, at Sellers election, paid by
Seller to Purchaser at Closing or credited against the Purchase Price)
relating to such damage and acquire the Property without any other adjustment
in the Purchase Price in connection therewith.

(b) If the cost to repair the Hotel is less than Two Million and No/100
Dollars ($2,000,000.00) as a result of such casualty, then (i) the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated; (ii) Seller shall
assign to Purchaser at Closing all of Sellers rights to receive any insurance
proceeds (excluding business interruption proceeds applicable to periods prior
to the Cut-off Time and amounts already expended by Seller toward
repair); (iii) there shall be no reduction in the Purchase Price; (iv) any
amounts already received by Seller and any deductible shall be credited to
Purchaser at Closing (to the extent not yet already paid by Seller towards the
cost of repairing the Property); and Purchaser shall assume responsibility
for repair after the Closing.

11.02 _Takings_. If, after the Effective Date and prior to the Closing Date,
all or any portion of the Real Property is taken by eminent domain or by an
act of governmental authority, Seller shall promptly give Purchaser written
notice thereof, and the following shall apply: 



 

40 (a) If a material part of a Real Property is taken, Purchaser may, within five
(5) days after the giving of Sellers notice, by written notice to Seller,
elect to terminate this Agreement. For purposes of this Section 11.02, a
"material" part of the Real Property shall be deemed to have been taken if (i)
the Hotel buildings must be reconfigured as a result of such taking; (ii) the
taking materially interferes with the present use and operation of any of the
buildings comprising the Real Property or the operation of the business of the
Hotel; (iii) the taking causes a material reduction in the size of any of the
buildings comprising the Improvements; or (iv) the taking results in the
elimination of the sole or any required means of legal ingress and/or egress
from the Real Property to public roads, with no comparable, convenient legal
substitute ingress and/or egress being available. In the event that Purchaser
shall so elect, the Earnest Money shall be disbursed to Purchaser, and all
obligations between Seller and Purchaser under this Agreement will terminate
except for those that expressly survive termination.

(b) If a material part of the Real Property is taken but Purchaser does not
elect to terminate this Agreement pursuant to paragraph (a) above, or if an
immaterial part of the Real Property is taken by an act of governmental
authority, neither party shall have any right to terminate this Agreement,
and the parties shall nonetheless proceed to the Closing in accordance with
this Agreement, without any abatement of the Purchase Price or any liability
or obligation on the part of Seller by reason of such taking, provided,
however, that Seller shall, at the Closing, (i) assign and turn over, and
Purchaser shall be entitled to receive and keep, the proceeds of any award or
other proceeds of such taking which may have been collected by Seller as a
result of such taking, less any portion thereof applied to the cost of
repairs made by Seller and approved by Purchaser prior to the Closing, or (ii)
if no award or other proceeds shall have been collected, deliver to Purchaser
an assignment of Sellers right to any such award or other proceeds which may
be payable to Seller as a result of such taking, less an amount equal to the
cost of any repairs made by Seller and approved by Purchaser prior to the
Closing, which amount shall be paid to Seller by Purchaser at the Closing. If
the proceeds are paid to the holder of any mortgage or deed of trust on the
Real Property and such holder refuses to release sufficient sums therefrom for
the purpose of making repairs and restorations required by reason of such
condemnation, then, at the Closing, Seller (at Sellers sole option) shall
either pay to Purchaser the amount of the proceeds or credit such amount
against the Purchase Price.

ARTICLE XII

EMPLOYEES 

12.01 _Employees_. Purchaser acknowledges that all Employees providing
services at the Property are currently employed by either Manager or the
Daily Grill Manager and will continue in that employment unless otherwise
agreed by Seller, Purchaser and Manager. Seller shall be responsible for
reimbursing Manager for all Employees Compensation in accordance with
the Management Agreement until the Cut-off Time. Seller shall indemnify and
hold Purchaser harmless from and against any and all Liabilities related to
any of the foregoing items.

12.02 _WARN Act_. Unless the Management Agreement is terminated on or before
the Closing Date, employment of all Employees at the Hotel will continue to
remain with the Manager and Purchaser will not take any action which would
trigger the application of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act (or similar local or state laws or regulations)



 

41 (collectively, the "WARN Act"). If the Management Agreement is terminated on
or before the Closing Date, Purchaser agrees that it will hire or cause to be
hired effective at and upon the Closing Date a sufficient number of Employees,
on such terms and for such period of time, as are required so as to preclude
any requirement for Manager or Seller to give the Employees notice of
termination pursuant to the WARN Act. In the event that Purchaser fails to
comply with any of the foregoing covenants, Purchaser hereby agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold Seller and Manager and their affiliates harmless
from and against any and all losses, costs, damages, expenses and liabilities
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorney fees) that Seller or
Manager incur under the WARN Act as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

12.03 _Claims_. Seller or Manager shall be responsible for the payment of any
final award or judgment rendered, or settlement reached, with respect to any
claims, demands, actions or administrative proceedings brought by any of the
Employees before or after the Closing Date except to the extent that the
claims, demands, actions and administrative proceedings brought by the
Employees relate to events which occurred after the Cut-off Time. As between
Purchaser and Seller, Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of any
final award or judgment rendered, or settlement reached, with respect to any
claims, demands, actions or administrative proceedings brought by any of the
Hotel employees after the Closing Date to the extent that the claims, demands,
actions and administrative proceedings brought by such employees relate to
events which occurred after the Cut-off Time.

12.04 _Labor Relations_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
cause Operating Lessee, to the extent of Operating Lessees rights under the
Management Agreement, to cause Manager to not recognize any labor union or
negotiate or enter into any labor contract (including but not limited to a
neutrality agreement, a card-check agreement or a labor peace agreement) with
any labor union which may affect the Hotels labor relations (and current
nonunion status) without Purchasers prior written consent, which consent may
be withheld at Purchasers discretion. In the event Seller or Operating
Lessee learns of any labor organizing activity or any labor unrest at the
Hotel prior to the Closing Date, or if Seller or Operating Lessee is
confronted or approached by any labor union in regards to representing any
Employees prior to the Closing Date, or if a representation petition or unfair
labor practice charge is filed with the National Labor Relations Board
involving the Hotel, Seller shall immediately notify Purchaser of such
activity or event.

12.05 _Survival_. The provisions of Sections 12.01, 12.02 and 12.03 shall
survive the Closing until fully performed. 

ARTICLE XIII

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

14.01  _Additional Covenants_. In addition, the parties agree as follows:



 

43 (a) Guest Baggage. All baggage of guests who are still in the Hotel on the
Closing Date, which has been checked with or left in the care of Seller,
Operating Lessee or Manager shall be inventoried, sealed, and tagged jointly
by Seller and Purchaser on the Closing Date. Purchaser hereby indemnifies
Seller and Operating Lessee and their respective Indemnitees against any
Liabilities in connection with such inventoried baggage arising out of the
acts of omissions of Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates (or any
of their employees or agents) after the Closing Date. Seller
hereby indemnifies Purchaser and its Indemnitees against any Liabilities in
connection with such baggage arising out of the acts or omissions of Manager,
Seller or any of its Affiliates (or any of their employees or agents) prior to
the Closing Date. The provisions of this Section 14.01(c) shall survive the
Closing.

(b) Safe Deposits. Immediately after the Closing, Seller shall send or cause
Manager to send written notice to guests or tenants or other persons who have
safe deposit boxes, advising of the sale of the Hotel to Purchaser and
requesting immediate removal of the contents thereof or the removal thereof
and concurrent re-deposit of such contents pursuant to new safe deposit
agreements with Purchaser. Seller shall have a representative present when the
boxes are opened, in the presence of a representative of the Purchaser. Any
property contained in the safe deposit boxes after such re-deposit shall be
the responsibility of Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Indemnitees from and against any Liabilities arising
out of or with respect to such property. The provisions of this Section
14.01(d) shall survive the Closing.

(c) Tax Appeal Proceedings. Seller shall be entitled to receive and retain
the proceeds from any tax appeals or protests for tax fiscal years prior to
the tax fiscal year in which the Closing Date occurs. In the event an
application to reduce real estate taxes is filed by Purchaser for the period
during which Seller was the owner of the Real Property, Seller shall be
entitled to a reproration of real estate taxes upon receipt of and based upon
the reduction, net of any costs incurred by Purchaser in obtaining such
reduction. Seller shall continue to process any pending appeals or protests
with respect to the tax fiscal year in which the Closing Date occurs, and the
net proceeds from any such proceedings, after payment of attorneys fees and
other costs associated with such process, will be prorated between the
parties, when received, as of the Closing Date. The apportionment obligations
in this Section 14.01(e) shall survive the Closing.

(d) Books and Records. The transaction contemplated hereby includes all the
books and records of Seller pertaining to the business of the Hotel. Purchaser
covenants and agrees that such books and records will remain in the Hotel for
examination and audit by Seller and its agents after the Closing as provided
in this clause (d). Books and records not pertaining to the business of the
Hotel may be removed by Seller on or before the Closing Date.
Purchaser agrees to preserve all books and records, files and correspondence,
for at least three (3) years after the Closing Date, and not to destroy or
dispose of the same, for at least three (3) years after the Closing Date.
Purchaser agrees to provide access to Seller and its representatives, to such
books, records, files and correspondence at all reasonable times and will
cooperate and cause its manager to cooperate with Seller in accessing such
records during such period.

(e) Survival. The representations, warranties, obligations, covenants,
agreements, undertakings, and indemnifications of Seller and
Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing only to the
extent expressly set forth in this Agreement.



 

44 (f) Publicity. Prior to Closing, all notice to third parties and all other
publicity concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
jointly planned and coordinated by and between Purchaser and Seller. Neither
party shall act unilaterally in this regard without the prior written approval
of the other; however, this approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

(g) Assignment. Neither all nor any portion of Purchasers interest under
this Agreement may be sold, assigned, encumbered, conveyed, or otherwise
transferred, whether directly or indirectly, voluntarily or involuntarily, or
by operation of law or otherwise including, without limitation, by a transfer
of interest in Purchaser (collectively, a "Transfer"), without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent may be granted or denied in Sellers
sole and absolute discretion; provided, however, that Purchaser may Transfer
its interest under this Agreement without Sellers consent to any Affiliate
or any entity in which Purchaser or its Affiliate owns an equity interest
provided such transferee assumes all Purchasers obligations hereunder. Any
attempted Transfer without Sellers consent shall be null and void other than
as provided herein. Any request by Purchaser for Sellers consent to a
Transfer shall set forth in writing the details of the proposed Transfer,
including, without limitation, the name, ownership, and financial condition
of the prospective transferee and the financial details of the proposed
Transfer. In addition, Purchaser shall provide Seller with copies of all
Transfer documentation, certified by Purchaser to be true, correct, and
complete, and with all other information which Seller may reasonably request.
No transfer, whether with or without Sellers consent: (i) unless and until
the consummation of this transaction shall occur, shall operate to
release Purchaser or alter Purchasers primary liability to perform the
obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement or (ii) shall cause Seller to
incur any cost or other economic detriment in connection with such Transfer.
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their permitted successors and assigns.

(h) Hotel Reservations. Purchaser shall honor (and shall cause any successor
manager engaged by Purchaser to honor) all reservations at the Hotel or for
any related conference, banquet, or meeting space or any recreational
facilities in connection with the Hotel made by Seller in the ordinary course
of business, at no less than the Hotels standard rates including customary
discounted rates, on or prior to the Cut-off Time for periods on or after the
Closing Date in accordance with Section 10.01(c) hereof. The obligations of
Purchaser set forth in this Section 14.01(i) shall survive the Closing.

(i) Business Days. If the Closing Date or any other date described in this
Agreement by which one party hereto must give notice to the other party hereto
or must fulfill an obligation is a Saturday, Sunday or a day observed by the
Federal government or by the State of California government as a legal
holiday, then such Closing Date or such other date shall be automatically
extended to the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal
holiday.

(j) Headings. Descriptive headings are for convenience only and shall not
control or affect the meaning or construction of any provision of
this Agreement.

(k) Interpretation. Whenever the context hereof shall so require, the singular
shall include the plural, the male gender shall include the female gender and
neuter and vice



 

45 versa. This Agreement and any related instruments shall not be construed more
strictly against one party than against the other by virtue of the fact that
initial drafts were made and prepared by counsel for one of the parties, it
being recognized that this Agreement and any related instruments are the
product of extensive negotiations between the parties hereto and that both
parties hereto have contributed substantially and materially to the final
preparation of this Agreement and all related instruments.

(l) Severability. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in the
Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall
not affect any other provision hereof, and this Agreement shall be construed
as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been
contained herein.

(m) Time of Essence. Time is of the essence of each and every term, provision
and covenant of this Agreement. The expiration of any period of time
prescribed in this Agreement shall occur at 11:59 p.m. PDT of the last day of
the period, except as otherwise expressly set forth herein.

(n) IRS Reporting Requirements. Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree
that Section 6045(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 requires that notice
of the sale and purchase of the Property described in this Agreement, be
provided to the IRS by preparation of and filing with the IRS of IRS Form
1099-B; and further, Seller and Purchaser agree to furnish and provide to the
Escrow Company any and all information that the Escrow Company may require in
order for the Escrow Company to (a) comply with all instructions to the IRS
Form 1099-B in the preparation thereof, and (b) prepare and timely file with
the IRS said IRS Form 1099-B with respect to this transaction.

(o) 1031 Exchange. If either party hereto elects (the "Electing Party") to
conduct a tax free exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code,
as amended, then the other party hereto agrees to cooperate (the "Cooperating
Party") with the Electing Party in conducting such tax free exchange under
such Section 1031 of the Code relating to this transaction. In the event of
such an election, the Electing Party agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the
Cooperating Party harmless from and against any and all claims, demands,
causes of action, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees and costs of litigation, that the Cooperating Party may suffer
or incur by reason of such exchange. Purchaser and Seller expressly reserve
the right to assign their rights, but not their obligations, hereunder to a
Qualified Intermediary as provided in IRC Reg. 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) on or before
the Closing Date. Each Cooperating Party agrees to cooperate, but at no cost,
expense or risk to said Cooperating Party, and take any actions reasonably
requested by the Electing Party, to cause such exchange to be consummated and
to qualify as a like kind exchange under such Section 1031 of the Code,
including, but not limited to, (a) permitting this Agreement to be assigned to
a Qualified Intermediary and (b) conveying the Property to, or at the
direction of, the Qualified Intermediary. In no event, however, shall any
such exchange extend, delay or otherwise adversely affect the Closing Date and
in no event shall the Cooperating Party be required to take title to any other
property in connection with such exchange. The provisions of this Section
14.01(p) shall survive the Closing. All references in this paragraph to tax-
free exchange under Section 1031 of the



 

46 Code shall include "reverse exchanges" as set forth in Revenue Procedure
2000-37, 2000-2 C.B. 308.

such event, Seller and Purchaser shall mutually select a firm, person or
corporation to act as the successor escrow agent. The Escrow Companys
resignation shall not be effective until a successor agrees to act
hereunder; provided, however, if no successor is appointed and acting
hereunder within thirty (30) days after such notice is given, Escrow Company
may pay and deliver the proceeds then held in escrow into a court of competent
jurisdiction.

16.10 _Receipt of Notice of a Dispute_. If, prior to Closing, Escrow Company
receives written notice from Purchaser or Seller that a dispute exists with
respect to which proceedings have been commenced, Escrow Company shall retain
the disputed portion of the Earnest Money, until the first to occur of the
following:

(a) Receipt by Escrow Company of a notice signed by Seller and Purchaser
stating that the dispute has been resolved, which notice shall
contain instructions to Escrow Company with respect to the disbursement or
retention of amounts in the Earnest Money Escrow Account; or

(b) Receipt by Escrow Company of a final order of a court of competent
jurisdiction resolving the dispute, after which Escrow Company shall comply
with the decision of the court with respect to the disbursement or retention
of amounts in the Earnest Money Escrow Account.

ARTICLE XVII

DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES

17.01 _Seller s Remedies_. IF PURCHASER FAILS TO CONSUMMATE THE PURCHASE OF
THE PROPERTY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, ITS FAILURE TO TENDER THE PURCHASE PRICE THEREFOR, SUBJECT
TO THE ADJUSTMENTS AND PRORATIONS PROVIDED FOR HEREIN) FOR ANY REASON
EXCEPT (A) THE FAILURE OF ANY CONDITION PRECEDENT TO PURCHASERS OBLIGATIONS
SET FORTH IN ARTICLE IX OR (B) PURCHASERS TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT IN
ACCORDANCE WITH ITS TERMS, THEN SELLER SHALL BE ENTITLED AS ITS SOLE REMEDY
TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT AND RECOVER THE EARNEST MONEY AS LIQUIDATED
DAMAGES AND NOT AS A PENALTY, IN FULL SATISFACTION OF ANY CLAIMS AGAINST
PURCHASER. SELLER AND PURCHASER AGREE THAT THE SELLERS DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
PURCHASERS DEFAULT ARE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE AND THE AMOUNT OF THE EARNEST
MONEY IS A FAIR AND REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THOSE DAMAGES. THE PARTIES
ACKNOWLEDGE



 

50 THAT THE PAYMENT OF SUCH LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IS NOT INTENDED AS A FORFEITURE OR
PENALTY WITHIN THE MEANING OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 3275 OR 3369, BUT
IS INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES TO SELLER PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA
CIVIL CODE SECTIONS 1671, 1676 AND 1677. THE PARTIES HAVE SET FORTH THEIR
INITIALS BELOW TO INDICATE THEIR AGREEMENT WITH THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
PROVISION CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION.

17.02 _Purchaser s Remedies_. If Seller fails to perform its Obligations
under this Agreement in any material respect for any reason except the
failure of any condition precedent to Sellers Obligations under this
Agreement, then Purchasers sole remedies shall be: (a) to terminate this
Agreement by giving Seller written notice of such election prior to or at
Closing (the "Default Notice"), whereupon the Escrow Company shall promptly
return to Purchaser the Earnest Money, and neither party shall have any
further obligations, except as may be specifically set forth herein; (b) to
waive the default and close; or (c) to enforce specific performance of this
Agreement provided that an action for specific performance is filed by
Purchaser within sixty (60) days of the originally scheduled Closing Date. In
the event that Purchaser terminates this Agreement as aforesaid by reason of a
default by Seller hereunder, then Purchaser shall have the right to recover
its out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby up to a maximum amount of Three Hundred Thousand and
No/100 Dollars ($300,000), and in the case of a willful default by Seller,
Purchaser shall also have the right to recover any other damages provable by
Purchaser, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.02(h), up to a
maximum aggregate amount of out-of-pocket costs and provable damages of Five
Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($500,000).

17.03 _Surviving Obligations_. If, following Closing, either party fails to
perform any surviving obligations under this Agreement or if there shall have
been a breach of either partys warranties and representations under Sections
5.01 or 5.02 in any material respect (as the same are updated as of the
Closing Date pursuant to the Purchasers Closing Certificate and the Sellers
Closing Certificate, respectively), the non-defaulting party shall be entitled
to pursue any right and remedy to which such party is entitled to in equity
and at law, subject, however, to the limitations set forth in Section
17.04 hereof.

17.04 _Duration and Claims Procedures and Limitations on Certain Obligations_.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, all
representations and warranties contained in Sections 5.01 and 5.02 of this
Agreement, as updated pursuant to the Purchasers Closing Certificate and the
Sellers Closing Certificate, respectively (collectively, the "Post Closing
Obligations") shall survive the Closing until the date that is nine (9) months
after the Closing Date (the "Survival Period") and shall not merge into any of
the closing documents; provided, however, that no person, firm, or entity
shall have any liability or obligation with respect to any Post Closing
Obligations unless on or prior to the last day of the Survival Period after
the Closing Date, the party seeking to assert liability under such Post
Closing Obligations shall have notified the other party in writing setting
forth specifically the



 

51 claim being made and a detailed description and supporting documentation of
the claim (such notice being a "Claims Notice"). In the event Purchaser has
actual knowledge on or before the Closing that any representation or warranty
of Seller is incorrect or of any other claim that could be made after Closing
with respect to the Post Closing Obligations (either through Purchasers
independent investigation or through information and materials provided to
Purchaser by Seller) and Purchaser (although not obligated to do so) closes,
then Purchaser shall not be permitted to assert a claim for such matters
following the Closing Date. All liabilities and obligations under the Post
Closing Obligations shall lapse and be of no further force or effect after the
last day of the Survival Period, except with respect to any matter contained
in a Claims Notice delivered on or prior to the last day of the Survival
Period and an action if filed with respect thereto prior to the date that is
sixty (60) days following the expiration of the Survival Period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it
shall have no claim against Seller under the Post Closing Obligations unless
such damages exceed Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars
($250,000.00) and that the aggregate liability of Seller with respect to any
and all claims of Purchaser relating to any Post Closing Obligations shall in
no event exceed Two Million Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars
($2,500,000).

Strategic Hotel Funding, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company
("Funding") and the owner and holder, indirectly, of all of the issued and
outstanding equity interests in Seller, hereby undertakes and agrees that
Funding shall be jointly and severally liable with Seller to Purchaser with
respect to the Post Closing Obligations and with respect to Sellers
obligations set forth in Article VII which survive the Closing, provided that
(i) such liability shall be subject to all of the limitations applicable to
Sellers liabilities set forth in this Agreement and (ii) with respect to the
Post Closing Obligations, in no event shall such liability of Funding survive
with respect to any of Purchasers claims not made prior to the expiration of
the Survival Period

17.05 _Attorneys  Fees_. If either party shall engage the services of counsel
for the purpose of enforcing any of the rights or remedies of said party
hereunder or under any Closing Document (or defend itself in any proceeding
brought against it by the other party), then, in addition to any relief to
which said party shall otherwise be entitled, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to reimbursement for its reasonable attorneys fees, expenses and
other costs of any such proceeding.

17.06 _Survival_. The provision of this Article XVII shall survive
the Closing.

ARTICLE XVIII

TRANSFER OF LIQUOR ASSETS

18.01 _Liquor Assets Escrow_.

(a) Purchaser and Seller recognize that the Liquor Assets are currently owned
by Operating Lessee (in such capacity, "Liquor Seller"), and that the
transfer of the Liquor Assets is statutorily regulated pursuant to California
Business and Professions Code Section 23950 et seq., and is subject to the
approval of the ABC. In order to comply with these statutory requirements, at
Closing Purchaser (or its designee) and Liquor Seller shall execute a
separate escrow agreement relating to the transfer of the Liquor Assets to
Purchaser or its designee (the "Liquor Assets Escrow Agreement"), in the form
of _Exhibit "H"_ attached hereto, and the parties



 

52 shall deliver a fully executed Liquor Assets Escrow Agreement to the Liquor
Assets Escrow Agent. In addition to the Liquor Assets Escrow Agreement,
Purchaser and Seller agree (and Seller shall cause Liquor Seller to agree) to
execute such additional instruments and supplemental Escrow instructions as
may be reasonably required by the Liquor Assets Escrow Agent or applicable
law to consummate the transfers contemplated by the Liquor Assets Escrow
Agreement and which do not substantially alter said agreement or its intent.

(b) Simultaneously with the Closing, Purchaser shall deposit, as part of the
Purchase Price, an amount into the Liquor Assets Escrow, in cash or other
immediately available funds, equal to $25,000.00 for the Liquor Licenses (the
"Liquor Licenses Purchase Price") and an amount equal to $25,000.00 for the
Liquor Inventory (the "Liquor Inventory Purchase Price") (the Liquor Licenses
Purchase Price and the Liquor Inventory Purchase Price are herein
collectively referred to as the "Liquor Assets Purchase Price").

(c) At Closing, Liquor Seller shall cause to be deposited into the Liquor
Assets Escrow an executed but undated Liquor Assets Bill of Sale in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit "I"_ ; provided, however, if Purchaser (or its
designee) shall have received a permanent or temporary liquor license on or
before the Closing Date, then and in such event, Liquor Seller shall deliver
the Liquor Assets Bill of Sale to Purchaser (or its designee) at Closing.

(d) The Liquor Assets Escrow shall close as promptly as possible after the
Closing, subject to applicable Legal Requirements. Upon the closing of
the Liquor Assets Escrow, the Liquor Assets Escrow Agent shall deliver to
Liquor Seller all sums due to Liquor Seller from Purchaser for the Liquor
Assets (less any amounts disbursed to third parties by the Liquor Assets
Escrow Agent from the Liquor Assets Escrow pursuant to the terms of the
Liquor Assets Escrow Agreement) and, unless the Liquor Assets Bill of Sale
shall have been previously delivered to Purchaser (or its designee) pursuant
to Section 18.01(c) above, the Liquor Assets Escrow Agent shall date the
Liquor Assets Bill of Sale as of the closing date of the Liquor Assets Escrow
and shall deliver to Purchaser (or its designee) the Liquor Assets Bill of
Sale.

(e) If the ABC disapproves the application for transfer of the Liquor Licenses
to Purchaser or Purchasers designee, for any reason whatsoever,
such disapproval shall terminate the Liquor Assets Escrow, but in no event
shall such disapproval (i) prevent the sale of the Property (other than the
Liquor Assets) from closing on or before the Closing Date in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement; (ii) result in a right of rescission in favor of
Purchaser; or (iii) result in any liability of Seller or Liquor Seller, unless
such disapproval is caused by the acts or omissions of Seller or Liquor
Seller.

18.02 _Purchaser s Responsibilities_.

(a) Purchaser shall be responsible for complying, at its sole cost and
expense, with all statutes and regulations applicable to the transfer of the
Liquor Assets, including, without limitation, preparing and filing the Notice
of Intended Transfer referenced in the Liquor Assets Escrow Agreement, paying
all license and transfer fees, costs of recordation and publication, and sales
and use taxes arising from and after the transfer of the Liquor Assets;
and, after the Cut-off Time, for all statutes and regulations governing the
possession, dispensing, sale



 

53 or use of alcoholic beverages on the Real Property. Purchaser shall not be
responsible for accrued and unpaid liabilities arising prior to the Cut-off
Time.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Date, Purchaser (or its designee) shall
complete, execute, submit and, using its best efforts, shall diligently
pursue an application to the ABC for transfer of the Liquor Licenses from
Liquor Seller and for temporary liquor licenses adequate to permit Purchaser
or Purchasers designee to sell alcoholic beverages at the Hotel, after the
Closing, in a manner similar to current practices.

(c) If prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser is unable to obtain a temporary
liquor license pending approval of the ABC to the transfer of the Liquor
Licenses to Purchaser or Purchasers designee, Manager and Liquor Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to make alternative arrangements
reasonably satisfactory to Manager, Liquor Seller and Purchaser, at no cost,
expense, or liability to Seller, which will enable Purchaser to use the Liquor
Assets until the date (the "Outside Closing Date") which is the first to occur
of (i) the date Purchaser obtains a temporary liquor license; (ii) the close
of the Liquor Assets Escrow; or (iii) the date which is one hundred eighty
(180) days after the Closing Date; provided, however, that Purchaser shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Liquor Seller from any third-party
liability, damages or claims encountered in connection with such operations
during said period of time (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses), including any fines or penalties assessed by
ABC during such period. The parties will in good faith negotiate a management
agreement consistent with the foregoing and will enter into such agreement at
Closing. Managers, Liquor Sellers and Sellers obligations under this
Section and such management agreement shall continue for a period not to
exceed the Outside Closing Date and during such period Purchaser shall
maintain insurance coverage in amounts and with carriers required by Seller
naming Seller and Sellers affiliates as additional insureds.

(d) Seller agrees to cooperate and to cause Liquor Seller and Manager to
cooperate with Purchaser and use commercially reasonable efforts in completing
a transfer to Purchaser of the Liquor Assets, but at no cost, expense, or
liability to Seller (other than the attorneys fees of Seller and
Liquor Seller), it being understood that Purchaser shall pay all fees,
charges and related costs in connection with obtaining the Liquor Licenses.

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 18.02 or elsewhere in this Article XVIII
shall, in any way, limit or affect Purchasers obligation to close the
purchase of the Hotel on or before Closing Date, unless Purchasers inability
to obtain ABC approval for temporary liquor licenses or with respect to the
transfer of the Liquor Licenses from Liquor Seller to Purchaser (or its
designee) is caused by the acts or omissions of Seller or Liquor Seller.



 

54 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed or caused this Agreement
to be executed, all as of the day and year first above written.
