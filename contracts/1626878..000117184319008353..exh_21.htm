(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
_Section 2.5(a)_ , Seller shall be eligible to earn up to a maximum of four
Milestone Payments, for a maximum of $600,000,000. In no event shall Buyer be

(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
_Section 2.5_, it is the intention of the Parties that the Exploitation of
the Compound shall be exercised by Buyer and its Affiliates in accordance with
their own business judgment and in their sole and absolute discretion.
Accordingly, the following shall apply (and Seller hereby acknowledges,
understands and agrees as follows):

  



  

(i)  Buyer and its Affiliates shall have complete
control and sole discretion with respect to decisions concerning the
Exploitation of the Compound and such control and discretion by Buyer and its
Affiliates could result in Seller receiving no Milestone Payment whatsoever;

  



  

(ii)  neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates has any
duty to Exploit the Compound, to exert any level of efforts in Exploiting the
Compound or to achieve the milestone described in _Section 2.5(a)_ above;

  



  

(iii)  whether or not Buyer or any of its Affiliates
Exploit the Compound, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates is
prohibited from Exploiting any other compounds or products that may compete
with the Compound, or prioritizing other compounds or products over the
Compound;

  



  

(iv)  in making decisions regarding the Exploitation of
the Compound, personnel of Buyer and its Affiliates are not required to take
into account the interests of Seller; and

  



  

(v)  Seller shall not challenge in any Action any
decision to, or not to, Exploit the Compound made by any director,
officer, employee or agent of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, unless such
Action is in respect of a breach by Buyer of any of its express obligations
to make a Milestone Payment under this _Section 2.5_.

  



  

Section 2.6.   _Third Party Consents_. If the assignment or transfer
of any asset included in the Purchased Assets or any claim, right or benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, without the consent of a Third
Party, would constitute a breach or other contravention of the rights of such
Third Party, would be ineffective with respect to any party to an agreement
concerning such asset, claim, right or benefit, or, upon assignment or
transfer, would in any way adversely affect the rights of Seller or,
upon transfer, Buyer (each, a " _Non-Assignable Right_ "), then Seller shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts, at Seller's sole cost and expense,
to obtain such consent after the execution of this Agreement until such
consent is obtained. If any such consent cannot be obtained prior to the
Closing and the Closing occurs, then, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or any Related Document, (a) this Agreement and
the related instruments of transfer shall not constitute an assignment or
transfer of the applicable Non-Assignable Right until and unless such consent
is obtained (at which point such Non-Assignable Right will be deemed to have
been assigned or transferred under this Agreement on such date (the "
_Transfer Date_ ")), and Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts, at Seller's sole cost and expense, to obtain such consent as soon as
possible after the Closing; and (b) upon delivery of Buyer's written election
to Seller, (i) the Non-Assignable Right shall be an Excluded Asset and Buyer
shall have no Liability whatsoever with respect to any such Non-Assignable
Right or any Liability with respect thereto (and any consent to transfer or
assignment obtained thereafter shall have no effect) or (ii) Seller shall, at
its sole cost and expense, obtain for Buyer substantially all of the practical
benefit and burden of such Non-Assignable Right, including by (A) entering
into appropriate and reasonable alternative arrangements on terms mutually
agreeable to Buyer and Seller, (B) subject to the consent and control of
Buyer, enforcement, at the cost and for the account of Buyer, of any and all
rights of Seller against the other party thereto arising out of the breach or
cancellation thereof by such other party or otherwise and (C) continuing to
comply with, and perform, any contractual obligations associated with such
Non-Assignable Right. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section
2.6_ shall affect any determination as to whether any of the conditions set
forth in _Article VI_ have been satisfied.

Section 2.7.   _Escrow Amount_.

  



  

(a)  In accordance with _Section 2.1(b)(i)_, at the Closing,
Buyer shall deposit with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the "
_Escrow Agent_ "), an amount equal to the Escrow Amount, such amount plus all
accumulated earnings thereon (such amounts, if any, " _Escrow Consideration_
") to constitute an escrow fund (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") to be governed in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The
Escrow Fund may be used to satisfy any indemnification amounts owed by Seller
pursuant to _Article VII_.

  



  

(b)  Upon the date that is 18 months from the Closing (the "
_Escrow Termination Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall, in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement, release the remaining amount in the Escrow Fund at such
time, less the Outstanding Claim Reserve at such time, to Seller. If, at any
time after the Escrow Termination Date, the Outstanding Claim Reserve, as
determined by Buyer in good faith, by a court or by mutual agreement of Buyer
and Seller, is less than the Escrow Fund at such time, then an amount equal
to such difference shall be released to Seller.

  



  

(c)  For purposes of this _Section 2.7_ , " _Outstanding Claim
Reserve_ " as of any date means the sum of all amounts claimed by Buyer as of
such date to be then owed to the Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect of
indemnity claims made by the Buyer Indemnified Parties as of such date in
accordance with _Article VII_.

  



  

(d)  All funds so released from the Escrow Fund shall include
any Escrow Consideration earned thereon. The amount of any funds released
from the Escrow Fund pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_ shall, for the avoidance of
doubt, be deemed a part of the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. The Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be
subject to any Lien, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes
and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
Upon the final release of all of the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agreement shall
terminate.

ARTICLE III 
  
 Representations and Warranties of Seller

  



  

Subject to the Schedules attached hereto (to the extent any such Schedule is

Section 3.1.   _Organization, Standing and Power_. Seller is a
corporation, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the Province of British Columbia, and has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own, lease or otherwise hold and operate its
properties and other assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted, except where the failure to be in good standing or have such power
or authority, individually or in the aggregate, has not been and would not
reasonably be expected to be material to Seller or the Business. Seller and
each of its Affiliates is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing (in jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing)
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or to be in good standing individually or in the
aggregate has not been and would not reasonably be expected to be material to
Seller or the Business. Seller has made available to Buyer, prior to the
execution of this Agreement, complete and accurate copies of Seller's articles
(" _Seller 's Charter_"), as amended to the date hereof. Seller is not in
violation of any of the provisions of Seller's Charter.

  



  

Section 3.2.   _Authority; Noncontravention_. (a) Seller has all
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and the Related Documents and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Related Documents by Seller
and the consummation by Seller of the Contemplated Transactions have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Seller and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Seller or any of its
Affiliates are necessary to authorize this Agreement, the Related Documents
or to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. Each of this Agreement and
the Related Documents has been duly executed and delivered by Seller and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Buyer, constitutes
a legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller, enforceable against Seller in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar Laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and
the availability of equitable remedies. No stockholder or other equity holder
approval is required on behalf of Seller for the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement or any Related Document.

  



  

(b)  The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Related Documents by Seller do not, and the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions and compliance by Seller with the provisions of
this Agreement and the Related Documents will not, conflict with, or result
in any violation or breach of, or default under (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both), or give rise to a right of, or result in,
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of
a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon the
Purchased Assets under, (i) Seller's Charter, (ii) any Contract to
which Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party or to which any of the
Purchased Assets are subject or (iii) any (A) statute, ordinance, rule,
regulation or other Law applicable to Seller, any of its Affiliates or the
Business or (B) Order applicable to Seller, any of its Affiliates or the
Business, except in the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii), where the conflict,
violation, breach, default, termination, cancellation, acceleration or
creation of a Lien, individually or in the aggregate, has not been and would
not reasonably be expected to be material to Seller or the Business, or that
would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially
delay the consummation by Seller of the Contemplated Transactions.

(c)  No consent, approval, Order or authorization of, action by
or in respect of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Authority (each, a " _Governmental Consent_ ") is required by or
with respect to Seller, any of its Affiliates or the Business in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any Related Document by
Seller, the transfer of the Purchased Assets to Buyer or the consummation of
the Contemplated Transactions, except for (i) such consents, approvals,
Orders, authorizations, actions, registrations, declarations or filings the
absence of which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to be material to Seller or the Business, (ii) filing assignments
with respect to registered Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights and (iii) the
receipt, termination or expiration, as applicable, of approvals or waiting
periods under any applicable antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar
Laws.

  



  

Section 3.3.   _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December
31, 2018 (a) no event has occurred which would reasonably be expected to
result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (b)
there has been no material loss, destruction or damage (in each case, whether
or not insured) affecting the Business and (c) Seller and its Affiliates have
conducted activities with respect to the Business in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and have not taken any actions,
which, if taken after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing
Date would constitute a breach of _Section 5.1(b)_.

  



  

Section 3.4.   _Good Title; Sufficiency of Assets_.

  



  

(a)  (i) Seller (together with its Affiliates) has good and
marketable title to, or valid contract rights to, as applicable, all of the
Purchased Assets free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), and
has the complete and unrestricted power and unqualified right to sell,
assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer, as applicable, the Purchased Assets and
(ii) there are no adverse claims of ownership to the Purchased Assets and
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has received notice that any Person
has asserted a claim of ownership or right of possession or use in or to any
of the Purchased Assets, nor are there, to Seller's Knowledge, any facts,
circumstances or conditions on which any such claim could be brought in the
future. At the Closing, Buyer will acquire from Seller (and its Affiliates)
good and marketable title to, or valid contract rights to, as applicable, all
of the Purchased Assets, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted
Liens).

  



  

(b)  Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.4(b)_ , the Purchased
Assets, together with the Intellectual Property Rights licensed pursuant to
the IP License Agreement, constitute (i) all of the properties, interests,
assets and rights of Seller or any of its Affiliates acquired, conceived,
collected, compiled, generated, reduced to practice or otherwise made or used
in connection with the Compound Program and (ii) all of the properties,
interests, assets and rights of Seller or any of its Affiliates used, held

Compound, in each case that are reasonably necessary for Buyer and its
Affiliates to continue to conduct the Compound Program as conducted during the
Reference Period.

Section 3.5.   _Intellectual Property_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to _Sections 3.5(b)_ and _3.5(f)_ , Seller
(together with its Affiliates) exclusively owns, or validly Controls, all

than Permitted Liens). Each such Intellectual Property Right will,
immediately subsequent to the Closing, be transferred to, and Controlled by,
Buyer on the same terms with which Seller (or its applicable
Affiliate), immediately prior to the Closing, Controlled such Intellectual
Property Right (subject to the effect of the IP License Agreement). Other

or Software that are owned or Controlled by Seller and primarily related to
or reasonably necessary to conduct the Business as conducted during the
Reference Period. Seller and its Affiliates have used reasonable efforts to
make all filings with Governmental Authorities and obtain all grants and
registrations as may be necessary or appropriate to preserve and protect the
Seller Intellectual Property.

  



  

(b)  To Seller's Knowledge, neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates has infringed, diluted, misappropriated or otherwise violated or
is infringing, diluting, misappropriating or otherwise violating (including
with respect to the discovery, development, clinical testing, manufacture,
distribution, advertising, use, Exploitation or sale by Seller or any of its
Affiliates of the Compound) the rights of any other Person with regard to
Seller's or its Affiliates' possession, use or Control of any
Seller Intellectual Property for the Business as conducted during the
Reference Period. To Seller's Knowledge, no other Person or Persons has
infringed, diluted, misappropriated or otherwise violated or is or are
infringing, diluting, misappropriating or otherwise violating the Seller
Intellectual Property.

  



  

(c)  The Seller Intellectual Property is, to Seller's Knowledge,
enforceable and valid, and no claims against Seller or any of its Affiliates
are pending or, to Seller's Knowledge, threatened with regard to (i) the
Control or use of any Seller Intellectual Property; (ii) any actual or
potential infringement, dilution, misappropriation or unauthorized use of
Seller Intellectual Property; (iii) any actual or potential infringement,
dilution, misappropriation or unauthorized use of any Third
Party's Intellectual Property Rights with respect to any Seller Intellectual
Property or the Business; or (iv) the validity or enforceability of any
Seller Intellectual Property. Seller (or its applicable Affiliate) has the
right to bring actions for infringement, including all rights to recover

(d)   _Schedule 1.1(d)_ sets forth, as of the date hereof, a
complete and accurate list of all patents and applications therefor (which
list specifically identifies all patents and patent applications solely and
exclusively owned by Seller and its Affiliates), registered trademarks and
applications therefor (if any), material common law trademarks, domain name
registrations (if any), copyright registrations (if any) and all invention
disclosures, that, in each case, are Controlled by Seller and its Affiliates
and related to the Business. The patent applications listed in _Schedule
1.1(d)_ that are owned by Seller and its Affiliates are (and such
applications that are otherwise Controlled by Seller and its Affiliates are,
to Seller's Knowledge) pending and have not been abandoned and have been and
continue to be timely prosecuted except as otherwise set forth in _Schedule
1.1(d)_. All patents, registered trademarks and applications therefor owned by
Seller and its Affiliates that are related to the Business have been (and all
such patents, registered trademarks and applications otherwise Controlled by
Seller and its Affiliates have been to Seller's Knowledge) duly registered or
filed with or issued by each appropriate Governmental Authority in the
jurisdiction indicated in _Schedule 1.1(d)_ , all related necessary affidavits
of continuing use have been (or, with respect to licenses, to Seller's
Knowledge have been) timely filed, and all related necessary maintenance
fees have been (or, with respect to licenses, to Seller's Knowledge have
been) timely paid to continue all such rights in effect except as otherwise
set forth in _Schedule 1.1(d)_. None of the patents listed in _Schedule
1.1(d)_ that are owned by Seller or its Affiliates has (and no such patents
that are otherwise Controlled by Seller or its Affiliates have, to
Seller's Knowledge) expired, been disclaimed (except by terminal
disclaimers), in whole or in part, been declared invalid, in whole or
in part, or held to be unenforceable by any Governmental Authority except as
otherwise set forth in _Schedule 1.1(d)_. None of the trademarks or trademark
applications listed in _Schedule 1.1(d)_ that are owned by Seller or its
Affiliates are (and no such trademarks or trademark applications that are
otherwise Controlled by Seller or its Affiliates are to Seller's
Knowledge) involved in or the subject of any ongoing oppositions,
cancellations or other proceedings. None of the patents or patent
applications listed in _Schedule 1.1(d)_ that are owned by Seller or its
Affiliates are (and no such patents or patent applications that are otherwise
Controlled by Seller or its Affiliates are, to Seller's Knowledge) involved in
or the subject of any material ongoing interferences, oppositions, reissues,
reexaminations or other proceedings (except for appeals), including ex parte
(other than ex parte proceedings in connection with such patent applications)
and post-grant proceedings, in the United States Patent and Trademark Office
or in any foreign patent office or similar administrative agency. To Seller's
Knowledge, there are no published patents, patent applications, articles or
other prior art references that are likely to invalidate any patent listed in
_Schedule 1.1(d)_. Each of the patents and patent applications listed in
_Schedule 1.1(d)_ that are owned by Seller and its Affiliates properly
identifies (and, to Seller's Knowledge, such patents and applications

every inventor of the claims thereof as determined in accordance with
the Laws of the jurisdiction in which such patent is issued or such patent
application is pending. Each inventor named on the patents and patent
applications listed in _Schedule 1.1(d) _that are owned by Seller and its
Affiliates has executed (and, to Seller's Knowledge, such inventors named on
such patents and applications that are otherwise Controlled by Seller and
its Affiliates and material to the Business have executed) an agreement
assigning his, her or its entire right, title and interest in and to such
patent or patent application, and the inventions embodied and claimed therein,
to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller, or in the case of licensed Patents, to
the appropriate owners. No such inventor has any contractual or other
obligation that would preclude any such assignment or otherwise conflict with
the obligations of such inventor to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller
under such agreement with Seller or such Affiliate.

  



  

(e)  No current or former director, officer, employee,
contractor or consultant of Seller or any of its Affiliates owns any
rights in or to any Seller Intellectual Property. All current and former
directors, officers, employees, contractors and consultants of Seller and any
of its Affiliates who contributed to the Business or to the discovery,
creation or development of any Seller Intellectual Property did so (i) within
the scope of his or her employment such that it constituted a work made for
hire and all Seller Intellectual Property arising therefrom became the
exclusive property of Seller (or an Affiliate thereof) or (ii) pursuant to a
written agreement, assigned all of his or her rights in Seller Intellectual
Property to Seller (or an Affiliate thereof). No current or former directors,
officers, employees, contractors or consultants of Seller or any of its
Affiliates has made or threatened to make any claim or challenge against
Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with their contribution to the
Business or to the discovery, creation or development of any Seller
Intellectual Property.

any of its Affiliates and other material obligations in connection with such
options, rights, licenses or interests have been satisfied in a timely

efforts and taken commercially reasonable steps designed to
maintain, preserve and protect its Trade Secrets and other confidential
information acquired, conceived, developed, collected, compiled, generated,
reduced to practice or otherwise made or used in connection with or related to

protection of Intellectual Property Rights, (2) requiring all employees of
Seller and its Affiliates to execute confidentiality agreements with respect
to Intellectual Property Rights developed for or obtained from Seller and
its Affiliates and (3) entering into licenses and Contracts that generally
require licensees, contractors and other Third Parties with access to the
Trade Secrets or other confidential information to keep such Trade Secrets or
other confidential information confidential.

  



  

(h)  The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Related Documents by Seller do not, and the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions and compliance by Seller with the provisions of
this Agreement and any Related Document will not, conflict with, or result in
any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result in, termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation or to the loss of a
benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon or the
transfer of, any Seller Intellectual Property that is material to the
Business.

(i)   _Schedule 3.5(i)_ accurately describes each development
program conducted by Seller as of the date hereof with respect to any
monoclonal antibody other than bermekimab that targets human Interleukin 1
alpha (any such monoclonal antibody, an " _Existing Antibody_ "), none of
which development programs were initiated prior to [*****]. Each Existing

result of a _de novo_ discovery and development effort undertaken by Seller
or any of its Affiliates without the use of or reference to [*****] including
by means of [*****] (ii) qualifies as a new molecular entity under FDA
regulations and guidelines and (iii) [*****].

program described on _Schedule 3.5(i)_ , neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates or, to Seller's Knowledge, any of its or their Third Party
collaborators, has any development program that produced any molecules that
bind human Interleukin 1 alpha and have demonstrable biological activity.

  



  

(k)  Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates owns, Controls or
has an interest in any monoclonal antibody that targets human Interleukin 1
alpha other than the Compound or an Existing Antibody, with the exception of
any non-human anti-human anti-IL-1a antibody used for research purposes in
which any such antibody was not administered to humans.

  



  

(l)  Seller has disclosed to Buyer all Data and information
relating to the Compound and any other monoclonal antibody that targets human
Interleukin 1 alpha in its ownership or Control.

Affiliates is bound, in either case, that are primarily related or material to
the Business or (ii) to which any of the Purchased Assets are subject.

(b)  Seller has made available to Buyer true, accurate and
complete copies of the Assumed Contracts (and any Contracts listed on

to Buyer, taken as a whole. Buyer is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing (in jurisdictions that recognize the concept
of good standing) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or
the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to

aggregate, has not been and would not reasonably be expected to be material
to Buyer.

other corporate proceedings on the part of Buyer are necessary to
authorize this Agreement, the Related Documents or to consummate the

Documents has been duly executed and delivered by Buyer (or an Affiliate
thereof) and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Seller, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer (or an
Affiliate thereof), enforceable against Buyer (or an Affiliate thereof) in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar Laws affecting the rights of creditors generally
and the availability of equitable remedies.

  



  

(b)  The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Related Documents by Buyer do not, and the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions and compliance by Buyer with the provisions of this
Agreement and the Related Documents will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, or default under (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both), or give rise to a right of, or result in, termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon any of the properties
or other assets of Buyer under (i) the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of Buyer, (ii) any Contract to which Buyer is a party or any of its respective
properties or other assets is subject, or (iii) any (A) statute, ordinance,
rule, regulation or other Law applicable to Buyer or its properties or other
assets or (B) Order applicable to Buyer or its properties or other assets,
except in the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii), where the conflict, violation,
breach, default, termination, cancellation, acceleration or creation of a
Lien, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation by Buyer of
the Contemplated Transactions (including the payments required to be made
pursuant to _Article II_ ).

Section 4.4.   _Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the
actual knowledge of Buyer's officers, threatened before or by any
Governmental Authority that, if successful, could reasonably be expected to
result in restraining, enjoining or otherwise preventing the consummation by
Buyer of the Contemplated Transactions. There is no outstanding Order of any
Governmental Authority against Buyer that could reasonably be expected to
result in restraining, enjoining or otherwise preventing the consummation
by Buyer of the Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

Section 4.5.   _Brokers and Other Advisors_. No broker, investment
banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any

waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such documents or
information, nor its continued protection under the attorney-client
protection, attorney work-product doctrine, or other applicable
privilege, and shall remain entitled to such protection under those

(b)  From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall
promptly advise the other Party in writing of (i) the occurrence, or failure

or perform in any material respect any covenants, agreements or obligations
required to be complied with or performed by such Party under this Agreement,
in any such case to the extent such Party or its officers and directors have
actual knowledge of any such failure, occurrence or event. For the avoidance
of doubt, no disclosure pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ shall be deemed to

obligation or affect any determination as to whether any of the conditions

their Representatives may use any such information constituting an Excluded
Asset in connection with business activities not constituting the
Business. The obligations of Seller under this _Section 5.5(b)_ shall not
apply to information to the extent such information (A) becomes generally
available to the public without breach of Seller's obligations under _Section
5.1_ or this _Section 5.5(b)_  or (B) is required to be disclosed by Law or
any Order; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of the foregoing
clause (B), to the extent not prohibited by such Law or Order, Seller shall
notify Buyer as early in advance of such disclosure as is practicable to
allow Buyer to take appropriate measures (and Seller shall reasonably
cooperate, at the expense of Buyer, in the taking of such measures) to
preserve the confidentiality of such information.

(iv)  During any Offer Period and/or Negotiation Period,

or New Antibody Product, so long as Seller or its Affiliates retains the
exclusive right to commercialize the New Antibody or the New Antibody Product
(and the exclusive right to the economic benefits thereof).

---|---|--- 

 



    

  

(e)   _Acknowledgments, Interpretation and Validity_.

  



  

(i)  Seller agrees and acknowledges that the covenants in
this _Section 5.6_ are reasonable and valid in all respects (including with
respect to the subject matter, Restricted Period, and geographical area
described in _Section 5.6(a)_ ) and are necessary to protect the interests of
Buyer in the Business and in the confidential information acquired by Buyer,
and such covenants represent only a limited restraint. Further, Seller
acknowledges that, without the restrictions contained in this _Section 5.6_ ,
the benefits of the Contemplated Transactions could be devalued, lost or
circumvented, particularly in light of the nature of the Business and the
ongoing development of the Compound, and that Buyer would not have entered
into this Agreement without the restrictions contained in this _Section
5.6_.

  



  

(ii)  Seller acknowledges and agrees that the provisions
of this _Section 5.6_ are necessary and reasonable to protect Buyer in the
conduct of its business and are a material inducement to Buyer's execution and
delivery of this Agreement and its willingness to enter into the Contemplated
Transactions.

  



  

(iii)  It is the desire and intent of the Parties that
this _Section 5.6_ will be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under
the Laws applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. If any
restriction set forth in this _Section 5.6_ is found by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any reason ( _e.g._ , because
it extends for too long a period of time, over too great a range of
activities or in too broad a geographic area), this _Section 5.6_ shall
be interpreted to extend over the maximum period of time, range of activities
or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable. The agreements
contained in this _Section 5.6 _shall each constitute a separate agreement
independently supported by good and adequate consideration. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Parties hereby acknowledge that Seller will benefit

(d)  As promptly as practicable (and in any event, no later than

reasonably necessary to conduct the Business, Buyer may designate such
Reviewable Contracts as Assumed Contracts by delivering written notice to
Seller of such designation and, upon delivery of such notice, such Reviewable
Contracts shall be deemed to be Assumed Contracts for all purposes hereunder.
If delivery of any such notice is made on or after the Closing Date, the
Reviewable Contracts designated in such notice shall be deemed, subject to
_Section 2.6_ , to have been assigned or transferred under this Agreement as
of the date of delivery of such notice (it being understood that the date of

Section 5.8.   _Certain Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a)   _Transfer Taxes_. All recordation, transfer, documentary,
excise, sales, value added, use, stamp, conveyance or other similar Taxes,
duties or governmental charges, and all recording or filing fees or similar
costs, imposed or levied by reason of, in connection with or attributable to
this Agreement, the Related Documents or the Contemplated Transactions
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be the borne solely by Buyer;
_provided_ , that any Transfer Taxes that are not recoverable by Buyer shall
be borne [*****]. Seller (or an Affiliate of Seller) shall prepare, or cause
to be prepared, all Tax Returns required to be filed in connection with such
Transfer Taxes, and Buyer shall provide any information that is reasonably
requested by Seller in connection with the preparation of such Tax Returns.
Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate in providing such certificates or
other documentation as may be necessary or advisable to avoid the collection
and payment of Transfer Taxes that would otherwise be due and payable absent
the provision of such documentation.

  



  

(b)   _Allocation of Taxes_. In the case of a taxable period
that includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_
"), (a) Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real, personal and
intangible property taxes) for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to
the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle
Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the Straddle Period; and (b) Taxes (other than Taxes
described in clause (a)) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as
if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

  



  

(c)   _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Buyer and its Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
Buyer believes in good faith are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state or
local (in each case, whether domestic or foreign) Tax Law and pay such
amounts over to the appropriate Taxing Authority. If Buyer determines that an
amount is so required to be deducted and withheld on its payment of the
Purchase Price, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to
Seller, at least three days prior to the expected Closing Date, written notice
of its intent to deduct and withhold on such payment, which notice shall
include a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount to be deducted and
withheld and the applicable provision of federal, state, local or non-U.S.
Tax Law pursuant to which such deduction and withholding is required. Upon
delivery of such notice, Buyer shall allow Seller a reasonable opportunity to
provide, prior to the expected Closing Date, such forms or other evidence
that would reduce or eliminate the amounts required to be deducted and
withheld from such payment. To the extent that amounts are deducted and
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority pursuant to this
_Section 5.8(c)_ , such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the party in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

  



  

[*****] Text omitted for confidential treatment. The redacted information has
been excluded because it is both (i) not material and (ii) would be
competitively harmful if publicly disclosed.

the other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by the other
Party in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, audit or other
examination by any Taxing Authority or Action relating to liability for Taxes
in connection with the Purchased Assets, (ii) retain and provide the other
with any records or other information that may be relevant to such
Tax Return, audit or examination, Action or determination and (iii) provide
the other with any final determination of any such audit or examination,
Action or determination that affects any amount required to be shown on any
Tax Return of the other for any period.

  



  

(e)   _Tax Treatment of Payments_. Except to the extent
otherwise required by Law, Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, treat any payment under _Section 2.5_ and _Article VII_ as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

  



  

Section 5.9.   _Public Announcements_.

  



  

(a)  Neither Buyer nor Seller, nor any Affiliate of either
Party, shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement

Document, either Party may issue a press release or make a public statement
with respect to the Contemplated Transactions without the consent of the other
Party as may be required by Law or the rules and regulations of any
applicable securities exchange or market. If any Party proposes to issue a
press release or make a public statement with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions pursuant to this _Section 5.9_, it will provide copies of such
press release or public statement to the other Party before such press release
or public statement is made, unless this would be in breach of any Law or the
rules and regulations of any applicable securities exchange or market, in
which case a copy of such press release or public statement will be provided
to the other Party as soon as reasonably practicable or in accordance with
such Law, rules or regulations.

  



  

(b)  From and after the Closing, except as required by Law or
the rules and regulations of any applicable securities exchange or market,

Days prior to the Closing, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall offer
employment commencing as of immediately following the Closing to each active
Business Employee on terms and conditions consistent with this _Section 5.10_
; _provided_ that, in the event any individual is identified as a
Business Employee in accordance with this Agreement less than 15 Business
Days prior to the Closing, such offer shall be made within 10 Business Days
of Seller delivering updated _Schedules 1.1(a)_ and _3.10(h)_ to Buyer that
include such individual. Any such offers made pursuant to this _Section 5.10_
shall be contingent on the Business Employee's satisfaction of
Buyer's typical employment screening processes. Seller and its Affiliates
shall encourage the Business Employees to accept the offers of employment
pursuant to this _Section 5.10_. Each Business Employee who accepts an offer
of employment pursuant to this _Section 5.10_ and becomes employed by Buyer
or one of its Affiliates pursuant to this _Section 5.10_ shall be referred to
herein as a " _Transferred Business Employee_." In the case of any individual
who becomes a Transferred Business Employee following the Closing Date, all
references in this Agreement (i) to the Closing Date (including in _Section
5.1_ ) shall be deemed to be references to the date that such individual
becomes a Transferred Business Employee and (ii) to the Transfer Time shall
be deemed to be references to 12:01 a.m., local time, on the date that such
individual becomes a Transferred Business Employee.

---|---|--- 

 



    

(b)   _Comparability_. For a period of not less than 12 months
following the applicable Transfer Time, each Transferred Business Employee
shall receive during their continued employment with Buyer and its Affiliates:
(i) at least the same base salary or wage rate and annual cash incentive
opportunities as those provided to such Transferred Business Employee
immediately prior to the Transfer Time; and (ii) other compensation and
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
either, at Buyer's election, (A) the other compensation and employee benefits
(excluding any equity-based compensation, defined benefit pension or post-
employment health or welfare benefits, and retention, change in control or
other similar payments or benefits) provided to such Transferred Business
Employee immediately prior to the Transfer Time, or (B) the other compensation
and employee benefits provided to similarly situated new hires of Buyer's
ultimate parent entity (" _Parent_ ") and its Affiliates.

  



  

(c)   _Service Credit_. Effective immediately after the
applicable Transfer Time and thereafter, Buyer shall provide, or shall cause
its Affiliates to provide, that periods of employment with Seller (including
any current or former Affiliate of Seller or any predecessor of Seller) shall
be taken into account (i) for purposes of vesting (but not eligibility or
benefit accrual) under Parent's defined benefit pension plan, (ii) for
purposes of eligibility and benefit accrual for vacation under
Parent's vacation program, (iii) for purposes of eligibility to participate
in any health or welfare plan maintained by Parent (other than any post-
employment health or post-employment welfare plan) and Parent's 401(k) plan,
and (iv) for benefit accrual purposes under Parent's severance plan (in the
case of each of clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), solely to the extent that
(A) such periods of employment are taken into account under analogous
Business Employee Benefit Plans before the applicable Transfer Time, to the
extent applicable, and (B) Parent makes such plan or program available to
Transferred Business Employees, and not in any case where credit would result
in duplication of benefits).

  



  

(d)   _Welfare Benefits_. With respect to any welfare plan
maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates in which a Transferred Business
Employee is eligible to participate after the Transfer Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such employee to the extent such conditions and
exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employee under the
welfare plans of Seller and its Affiliates prior to the applicable Transfer
Time and (ii) provide each Transferred Business Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the applicable Transfer Time, for
the calendar year in which such Transfer Time occurs, in satisfying any
analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable
under any such plan. For the avoidance of doubt, neither Parent nor any of
its Affiliates shall be required to take any action to the extent
Parent determines that such action could make a Transferred Business Employee
(or eligible dependent) ineligible for a benefit (for example, if credit for
past contributions would make the Transferred Business Employee ineligible for
health savings account contributions from Parent).

(e)   _Accrued Amounts_. As soon as practicable following the

Employees with respect to any vacation commitments communicated by such
Transferred Business Employees to Seller in accordance with Seller's standard
operating procedures and/or vacation policies prior to the applicable
Transfer Time in respect of periods occurring subsequent to the Transfer Time;
it being understood that any such vacation commitments ultimately honored by
Buyer and its Affiliates shall count against the applicable Transferred
Business Employee's paid-time-off accrued during his or her service with
Buyer and its Affiliates, or shall be unpaid.

  



  

(f)   _Employees on Leave_. With respect to any Business
Employee who, as of the Closing Date, is on approved leave of absence from

employment, Buyer or its applicable Affiliate shall offer employment to such
individual on the earliest practicable date following the return of such
individual to active employment with Seller and its Affiliates and otherwise
on terms and conditions consistent with this _Section 5.10_ ; _provided_
 that such employee returns to active employment within 180 days following
the Closing Date or such later time as required by applicable Law. Seller
shall promptly notify Buyer of the occurrence and end of any such leave of
absence.

  



  

(g)   _Seller Long-Term Incentive Awards_. Outstanding Seller
long-term incentive awards held by any Transferred Business Employee as of

and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section 5.10_ are included
for the sole benefit of the Parties. This Agreement is not intended by the
Parties to, and nothing in this _Section 5.10_ or otherwise in this
Agreement, whether express or implied, shall, (i) constitute an amendment to
any Business Employee Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan,

Parties to any person (other than the other Parties) with respect to any
employee compensation or benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or
arrangement of the Parent or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or

suffered or incurred by any such Seller Indemnified Party arising from,
relating to or otherwise in connection with:

  



  

(i)  any breach of any representation or warranty of

giving effect to any materiality threshold or qualifier contained therein;

  



  

(ii)  any breach of or failure to perform any covenant
or agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement or any Related Document;

  



  

(iii)  any Assumed Liability; or

Affiliates' operation of the Purchased Assets after the Closing, excluding,
for the avoidance of doubt, any Excluded Liabilities.

  



  

Section 7.3.   _Limitations_.

  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
no Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, shall
be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)(i)_ and _Section
7.2(a)(i)_:

  



  

(i)  unless and until the aggregate of all Losses for
which the Buyer Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as
applicable, would, but for this paragraph (i), be entitled to indemnification
hereunder exceeds on a cumulative basis $5,000,000 (the " _Indemnity
Threshold_ "), at which point each Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller

aggregate of all Losses in excess of the Indemnity Threshold; and

  

   

 | 56| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(ii)  unless the amount of an individual claim for
Losses under _Section 7.1(a)(i)_ or _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ (aggregating all
claims and Losses arising from substantially the same or similar facts as
applicable to each of _Section 7.1(a)(i)_  or _Section 7.2(a)(i)_), as
applicable, exceeds $25,000, and no such claim shall be applied toward the
Indemnity Threshold;

  



  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing provisions of this _Section
7.3(a)_ shall not apply with respect to any act of fraud or (i) any breach of
or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections
3.1_, _3.2(a)_ , _3.4(a)_ , _3.5(a)_ ,  _3.5(j)_ , _3.9_ , or _3.14_ (the "
_Specified Representations_ ") or (ii) any breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Sections 4.1_, _4.2(a)_ or _4.5_.

  



  

(b)  Other than in the case of any act of fraud (where the
rights of Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as
applicable, shall not be limited by anything set forth in this Agreement to
the contrary), in no event shall the aggregate amount for which Buyer
Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, shall be
indemnified and held harmless under  _Section 7.1(a)(i)_ and _Section
7.2(a)(i)_: (i) with respect to breaches of any of the representations
and warranties of (A) Seller other than the Specified Representations or (B)
Buyer other than those set forth in _Sections 4.1_,  _4.2(a)_ or _4.5_ , in
each case, exceed the Escrow Amount, and (ii) with respect to breaches of any
of (A) the Specified Representations or (B) the representations set forth in
_Sections 4.1_, _4.2(a)_ or _4.5_ , in each case, exceed the Purchase Price
(the " _Cap_ ").

  



  

Section 7.4.   _Indemnification Claims_. (a) In order for a Buyer
Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party (an " _Indemnified Party_ ")
to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under _Section 7.1_ or
_7.2_ in respect of, arising out of or involving an Action initiated or
commenced by or on behalf of a Third Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such
Indemnified Party must notify, with respect to a claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 7.1_ , Seller, or, with respect to a claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2_ , Buyer (each, an " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") in writing of the Third Party Claim (including in such notice a
brief description of the applicable claim(s), including damages sought or
estimated, to the extent actually known by such Indemnified Party) within 20
Business Days after receipt by such Indemnified Party of actual notice of the
Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided under _Section
7.1_ or _7.2_ except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure (it being understood that the failure
to have released the applicable portion of the Escrow Amount at the expected
release time due to an inability to ascertain the amount of Loss owed to a
Buyer Indemnified Party at such time shall not constitute such prejudice).
The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to undertake the defense
or opposition to such Third Party Claim (at the Indemnifying Party's expense)
with counsel selected by it and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party so long as (i) the Indemnifying Party gives written notice to the
Indemnified Party within 20 Business Days after it has been notified of the
Third Party Claim that it will defend the Indemnified Party against such Third
Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party acknowledges its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party for Losses related to such Third Party Claim
(subject to the Indemnity Threshold and the Cap, to the extent applicable, and
the other limitations set forth herein), (ii) the Third Party Claim involves
only money damages, does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party and does not relate to or arise in connection
with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation, (iii) the amount claimed in such Third Party Claim, taken
together with the reasonably estimated costs of defense thereof and
the claimed amount with respect to any unresolved claims for indemnification
under this _Article VII_ then pending, is (A) greater than the Indemnity
Threshold and (B) if applicable, less than the Cap (as reduced by any amounts
previously paid by the Indemnifying Party with respect to any resolved claims
for indemnification under this _Article VII_ ), (iv) the Indemnified Party has
not been advised in writing by outside counsel that a legal conflict exists
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection with
conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim, (v) the Third Party Claim
does not allege the infringement of the Intellectual Property Rights of any
Person by the Indemnified Party and (vi) the Indemnifying Party commits in
writing to the Indemnified Party to diligently and vigorously and in good
faith conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim. Neither the Indemnified
Party nor the Indemnifying Party shall settle any Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the other Party unless (1) the claimant in such
Third Party Claim provides to such other Party an unqualified release of such
other Party from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (2) such
settlement does not involve any injunctive relief binding upon such other
Party, (3) such settlement does not encumber any of the assets of such other
Party or impose any restriction or condition that would apply to or affect
such other Party or the conduct of such other Party's businesses and (4) such
settlement does not involve any admission of liability or wrongdoing by such
other Party.

(b)  In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement other than in respect of,
arising out of or involving a Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall
deliver notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying
Party (including in such notice a brief description of the applicable
claim(s), including damages sought or estimated, to the extent actually known
by such Indemnified Party); _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give
such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided under _Section
7.1_ or _7.2_ except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure (it being understood that the failure
to have released the applicable portion of the Escrow Amount at the expected
release time due to an inability to ascertain the amount of Loss owed to a
Buyer Indemnified Party at such time shall not constitute such prejudice). If
the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within 20
Business Days following its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party
disputes the indemnity claimed by the Indemnified Party under _Section 7.1_
or _7.2_ such indemnity claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such
notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability to be indemnified under
_Section 7.1_ or _7.2_  and the Indemnified Party shall be indemnified for
the amount of the Losses stated in such notice to the Indemnified Party on
demand or, in the case of any notice in which the Losses (or any portion
thereof) are estimated, on such later date when the amount of such Losses (or
such portion thereof) becomes finally determined, but in all cases subject to
the Indemnity Threshold and the Cap, to the extent applicable.

  



  

Section 7.5.   _Termination of Indemnification_. (a) The obligations
to indemnify and hold harmless an Indemnified Party hereto (i) pursuant to
_Sections 7.1(a)(i)_ and _7.2(a)(i)_ , shall terminate when the applicable
representation or warranty terminates pursuant to _Section 7.5(b)_ and (ii)
pursuant to the other clauses of _Sections 7.1(a)_ and _7.2(a)_  shall
terminate sixty (60) days after the expiration of any statute of limitations
applicable thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that as to clause (i) above such
obligation to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to
any Losses as to which the Indemnified Party shall have, before the
expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering
a notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party.

(b)  All representations, warranties, covenants and obligations
contained in this Agreement shall survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
except in the case of fraud, (i) the Specified Representations and the
representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 4.1_, _4.2(a)_ and
_4.5_ shall terminate sixty (60) days after the expiration of any statute of
limitations applicable thereto and (ii) the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement other than the Specified Representations shall
terminate on the date that is 18 months after the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_further_ , such covenants and agreements of the Parties shall survive until
they are fully performed or, if earlier, until the expiration thereof set
forth in the terms of such covenants and agreements.

  



  

Section 7.6.   _Exclusive Remedies_. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and
agree that after the Closing, the indemnification provisions of this _Article
VII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Buyer and Seller for any
breach of the representations or warranties or nonperformance of or default
under any covenants or agreements of Buyer or Seller contained in this
Agreement or any Related Document (other than (i) claims for equitable
relief, (ii) claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud or (iii) as
expressly provided in any Related Document).

 Termination

  



  

Section 8.1.   _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Closing:

(b)  by either Buyer or Seller, if:

  



  

(i)  the Closing shall not have occurred on or before
April 7, 2020 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be
available to any Party whose failure to perform and comply with any covenant,
agreement or obligation contained in this Agreement has been the
primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, the failure of the Closing to
occur on or before such date;

  



  

(ii)  if any Legal Restraint having the effect of
restraining, enjoining or otherwise preventing the consummation of the
Contemplated Transaction shall be in effect and shall have become final and
non-appealable; or

  



  

(iii)  the other Party shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants, agreements
or obligations contained in this Agreement, and such breach or failure to
perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
_Section 6.2(a)_ or _6.2(b)_ or in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ , as
applicable, and (B) cannot be cured by the Outside Date or, if capable of
being cured by the Outside Date, has not been cured prior to the date that is
15 days from the date that such other Party receives written notice of such
breach or failure to perform.

the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of termination of this Agreement
by either or both of Buyer and Seller pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , this
Agreement shall terminate and become void and have no effect, and there shall
be no liability or obligation on the part of any Party, other than the
provisions of _Section 5.5_ , _Section 5.13_ , this _Section 8.3_ and
_Article IX_ , which shall survive any such termination, and except to the
extent that such termination results from a material breach by a Party of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or
undertakings set forth in this Agreement.

Section 9.8.   _Enforcement_.

  



  

(a)  Each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of (i) the state courts of New York located in New York
County, and (ii) the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York, for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising
out of this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions. Each Party agrees to
commence any such action, suit or proceeding either in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or if such suit, action
or other proceeding may not be brought in such court for jurisdictional
reasons, in the state courts of New York located in New York County. Each
Party further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document
by the U.S. registered mail to such Party's respective address set forth
above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding
in New York with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to
jurisdiction in this _Section 9.8_. Each Party irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions in (x) the state courts of New York located in New
York County, and (y) the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, and hereby and thereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.

  



  

(b)  Each Party waives its right to trial of any issue by jury.
Each Party (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of the
other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such Party would
not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other Party has been
induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual
waiver and certifications in this  _Section 9.8(b)_.

  



  

(c)  The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and
that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the state courts of New York located in
New York County, and the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity and as further set forth in this
_Section 9.8_. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 9.8(c)_ shall not
restrict any Party from asserting that the terms and provisions of this
Agreement have not been breached (or would not be breached) by the actions or
omissions (or intended actions or omissions) of such Party.

Section 9.9.   _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement or any Related Document is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement or such Related Document shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement or such Related
Document so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.

  



  

Section 9.10.   _Amendment; Waiver_. No modification, amendment or waiver
of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing
and signed by the Party against whom enforcement of any such modification,
amendment or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement,
including any investigation by or on behalf of either Party, shall be deemed
to constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance by the
other Party with any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation contained herein. The waiver by either Party of a breach of any
provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or
continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach. Neither the failure of either Party to enforce, nor the delay of
either Party in enforcing, any condition or part of this Agreement at any time
shall be construed as a waiver of that condition or part or forfeit any
rights to future enforcement thereof.
