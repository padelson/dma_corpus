Section 2.1 Asset Purchase. Subject to Section 2.6 and Section 2.7, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Closing, Sphinx shall, or shall cause one or more of its Subsidiaries (such
Subsidiaries, the "Other Asset Sphinx Entities") to, sell, assign, transfer,
convey and deliver to Arion (or one or more designated wholly-owned direct or
indirect Subsidiaries of Arion (such Subsidiary, an "Other Arion Entity")),
and Arion shall, or shall cause such Other Arion Entity to, acquire and accept
from Sphinx or such Other Asset Sphinx Entity, all of Sphinx's and such Other
Asset Sphinx Entity's respective right, title and interest in and to all the
Purchased Assets as they exist as of the Closing or, with respect to any
Purchased Assets of a Separate Transfer Business, as of the applicable
Separate Transfer Date, free and clear of Liens other than Sphinx Permitted
Liens.

Section 2.2 Share Purchase. Subject to Section 2.6 and Section 2.7, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Closing, Sphinx shall, or shall cause one or more of its Subsidiaries (such
Subsidiaries, the "Other Share Sphinx Entities" and, together with the Other
Asset Sphinx Entities, the "Other Sphinx Entities") to, sell, assign,
transfer, convey and deliver to Arion (or an Other Arion Entity designated by
Arion), and Arion shall acquire and accept, or shall cause each such Other
Arion Entity to acquire and accept, from Sphinx or such Other Share Sphinx
Entities, all of Sphinx's and such Other Share Sphinx Entity's respective
right, title and interest in and to all of the Purchased Shares, free and
clear of Liens.

Section 2.3 Excluded Assets. All Excluded Assets shall be retained by Sphinx
and its Subsidiaries and are not being acquired by Arion.

Section 2.4 Assumed Liabilities; Excluded Liabilities.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Closing, Arion shall accept, assume and agree to pay, perform, fulfill
and discharge when due any and all Assumed Liabilities. From and after the
Closing, Arion shall be responsible for all Assumed Liabilities, regardless of
when or where such Assumed Liabilities arose or arise, or whether the facts on
which they are based occurred prior to or subsequent to the Closing Date,
regardless of where or against whom such Assumed Liabilities are asserted or
determined or whether asserted or determined prior to the Agreement Date.
Arion shall indemnify and promptly reimburse Sphinx for the performance by
Sphinx or any of its Subsidiaries of any Assumed Liability, including any
Assumed Liability that Sphinx or its Subsidiaries perform due to the
applicable obligee's exercise of its lawful rights not to accept the
performance of such Assumed Liability by, or on behalf of, Arion or any of its
Affiliates, subject to, and in accordance with, Article 9.

(b) The Parties agree that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, except for the Assumed Liabilities, none of Arion or any Other Arion
Entity shall accept, assume, pay, perform, fulfill or discharge or otherwise
have any Liability for, any Liabilities of Sphinx or any Subsidiary of Sphinx
(whether now existing or hereafter arising, regardless of where or against



whom such Liabilities are asserted or determined or whether asserted or
determined prior to or after the Effective Time), and Sphinx and its
Subsidiaries shall retain, and shall be solely responsible and liable for
paying, performing, fulfilling and discharging when due, all Liabilities of
Sphinx and its Subsidiaries other than the Assumed Liabilities, including the
Excluded Liabilities of Sphinx or its Subsidiaries.

Section 2.5 Transfer.

(a) The right, title and interest in and to the Purchased Assets and the
Purchased Shares of Sphinx and any Other Sphinx Entity and their Affiliates
shall be sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed and delivered, and the Assumed
Liabilities shall be assumed, in accordance with this Article 2 pursuant to
transfer and assumption agreements and such other instruments (including
deeds, leases, subleases, assignments, endorsements or other instruments of
transfer or conveyance) in such form as may be necessary or appropriate to
effect a conveyance of the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Assets and an
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities in the jurisdictions in which such
transfers are to be made. Such transfer and assumption agreements shall be in
a form mutually agreed by the Parties and shall include, as necessary based on
the local Law requirements in the jurisdictions in which such transfers are
made: (i) with respect to the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities, a bill
of sale and assignment and assumption agreement in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit E (the "Bill of Sale"), (ii) to the extent required
by Law or otherwise agreed by the Parties and in compliance with Section
2.5(b), a local transfer agreement for each jurisdiction other than the United
States in which Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities are located or the
Purchased Entities or the Business Entities underlying the Purchased Minority
Interests are organized (each such agreement, a "Local Transfer Agreement"),
(iii) (A) with respect to all Assigned Leased Property, the assignments and
other similar agreements having the terms set forth on Schedule 2.5(a)(iii)(A)
of the Sphinx Disclosure Letter and otherwise in form and substance mutually
agreed by Arion and Sphinx on or prior to the Closing (the "Assigned Lease
Agreements"), (B) with respect to all Subleased Property, the sublease and
other similar agreements having the terms set forth on Schedule 2.5(a)(iii)(B)
of the Sphinx Disclosure Letter and otherwise in form and substance mutually
agreed by Arion and Sphinx on or prior to the Agreement Date (the "Sublease
Agreements") and (C) with respect to all properties set forth on Schedule
2.5(a)(iii)(C)-1 of the Sphinx Disclosure Letter, the lease agreements having
the terms set forth on Schedule 2.5(a)(iii)(C)-2 of the Sphinx Disclosure
Letter and otherwise in form and substance mutually agreed by Arion and Sphinx
on or prior to the Closing (the "New Lease Agreements" and together with the
Assigned Lease Agreements and Sublease Agreements, collectively, the "Real
Property Leases"), (iv) with respect to the Purchased Shares, the Equity
Transfer Documents; provided that, with respect to Purchased Minority
Interests, Sphinx shall only be obligated to deliver such transfer documents
or instruments reasonably available to it and shall not be required to use any
efforts to obtain additional documentation from the Business Entities
associated with such Purchased Minority Interests, (v) with respect to
applicable Patents, a patent assignment agreement substantially in the form
attached as an exhibit to the IPMA (the "Patent Assignment"), (vi) with
respect to applicable Trademarks, a trademark assignment agreement
substantially in the form attached as an exhibit to the IPMA (the "Trademark
Assignment"), (vii) with respect to applicable Copyrights and Mask Work
Rights, a copyright and mask works assignment agreement substantially in the
form attached as an exhibit to the IPMA and (viii) with respect to applicable
Trade Secrets, a trade secret assignment agreement substantially in the form
attached as an exhibit to the IPMA.

(b) Each Local Transfer Agreement shall be in form and substance that is
customary in the relevant jurisdiction for a transfer of the type of assets or
shares, as applicable, being transferred



pursuant to such Local Transfer Agreement, shall maintain the same legal
meaning and effect under local Law as provided in this Agreement and shall be
mutually acceptable to Arion and Sphinx in all respects; provided that in each
case that (i) to the extent permissible under local Law, the Local Transfer
Agreements shall serve purely to effect the legal transfer of the applicable
Purchased Assets or Purchased Shares and shall not have any effect on the
value being received by Sphinx or given by Arion in the Purchase Transactions,
or the terms and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby, all of
which shall be determined by this Agreement, (ii) no such Local Transfer
Agreement shall in any way modify, amend, or constitute a waiver of, any
provision of this Agreement and (iii) no such Local Transfer Agreement shall
include any additional representations or warranties, covenants or agreements
except to the extent required by Law of the applicable jurisdiction. In the
event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and a Local Transfer
Agreement, this Agreement will control to the extent permissible under
applicable Law. Such Transfer pursuant to this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document will be effective as of Effective Time or at such other
times as specifically provided in each respective Transaction Document and
will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable Transaction Document.

Section 2.6 Shared Contracts; Approvals and Consents.

(a) Except as may otherwise be agreed by the Parties in writing or with
respect to any Excluded Shared Contract, Sphinx shall use reasonable best
efforts to separate, substitute, amend or replicate, on substantially the same
terms (to the extent practicable; provided that, any material change in terms
that would be applicable to Arion or an Other Arion Entity shall require the
prior written consent of Arion), and Transfer the portion of each Shared
Contract relating to the Business (the interest in such portion of a Shared
Contract, a "Split Interest") to and for the benefit of Arion or the
applicable Other Arion Entity such that as of the Effective Time, each of
Arion and Sphinx, or their applicable Subsidiaries as the case may be, shall
be entitled to the rights and benefits of such Shared Contract and shall
assume the related portion of any Liabilities (but, in the case of Arion,
solely to the extent such Liabilities are Assumed Liabilities) inuring to
their respective Split Interests in such Shared Contracts. Each Party shall
use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use reasonable best
efforts to, and shall reasonably cooperate with each other to, effect such
separation (including to take the actions described in Section 2.6(d) but
subject to Section 2.6(b)). The obligations of each Party under this Section
2.6(a) (not including, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) any obligation assumed
by Arion as an Assumed Liability or (y) any obligation retained by Sphinx as
an Excluded Liability) shall expire 18 months after the Closing Date.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any other Closing Transfer
Document to the contrary, neither this Agreement nor any other Closing
Transfer Document shall constitute an agreement (i) to sell, convey, transfer,
assign or deliver (a "Transfer") to Arion or any Other Arion Entity any
Purchased Asset (including any Business Real Properties) or any claim, right
or benefit arising under or resulting from such Purchased Asset or (ii)
separate and Transfer any Split Interest (including by way of replication of
the Shared Contract) or any claim, right or benefit arising under or resulting
from such Split Interest, in each case if and for so long as the Transfer or
attempted Transfer to Arion or any Other Arion Entity without the Consent of a
third party under applicable Law or the express terms of the applicable
Contract, (A) would constitute a breach or other contravention of the rights
of such third party, (B) would be ineffective with respect to any party to an
agreement concerning such Purchased Asset or to a Shared Contract or (C) would
materially and adversely affect the rights of Sphinx or its Subsidiaries or,
upon Transfer, the rights of Arion or its Affiliates (as assignee, transferee
or otherwise) with respect to such Purchased Asset



or Split Interest (such assets and interests being referred to herein as
"Restricted Assets" and "Restricted Split Interests", respectively, and
collectively, the "Restricted Right").

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless and
until any such Consent with respect to any Restricted Asset or Restricted
Split Interest, as appropriate, is obtained or the applicable restriction or
impediment on Transfer ceases to exist (such time, the "Consent Receipt
Time"), neither such Restricted Asset nor such Restricted Split Interest shall
constitute a Purchased Asset; provided that at no time on or after the Closing
shall any Restricted Rights for which the Consent Receipt Time has not
occurred constitute Excluded Assets nor shall any Liability arising out of, or
related to, such Restricted Rights constitute an Excluded Liability solely by
virtue of being Restricted Rights, in each case for purposes of Sphinx's
indemnification obligations under Article 9; provided, further, that the
Liabilities (other than Excluded Liabilities) relating to or arising in
connection with such Restricted Asset or Restricted Split Interest that would
have otherwise constituted Assumed Liabilities at the Closing, shall, upon
such Transfer to Arion or an applicable Other Arion Entity, be deemed to be an
Assumed Liability for purposes of this Agreement to the same extent as if
Transferred to Arion or such Other Arion Entity at the Closing. Once the
Consent Receipt Time occurs with respect to any Restricted Rights, such
Restricted Rights shall be Transferred to or assumed by Arion or an Other
Arion Entity (but not before such time and not before the Effective Time) for
no additional consideration, and, in each case, the rights, title and interest
to such Restricted Asset or Restricted Split Interest shall be deemed to be
Purchased Assets, in each case for purposes of this Agreement.

(d) From the Agreement Date until the date that is 18 months following the
Closing, each Party shall use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to use, reasonable best efforts, and shall reasonably cooperate with each
other, to obtain or to cause to be obtained any requisite Consent,
substitution, amendment, assignment or other modification required, including
by delivery of any notice, to (i) Transfer and novate to Arion or the
applicable Other Arion Entity all rights and obligations of Sphinx and its
Subsidiaries with respect to the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities
such that, in any case, Arion or the applicable Other Arion Entity will be
solely benefited by and responsible for such rights and obligations from and
after the Effective Time and (ii) except as may otherwise be agreed by the
Parties in writing or with respect to any Excluded Shared Contract, separate
and Transfer as of, or as promptly as practicable after, the Closing any
Shared Contracts having a Restricted Split Interest, including by way of
establishing a new contract with Arion or the applicable Other Arion Entity in
respect of the Restricted Split Interest or assigning such Restricted Split
Interest to Arion or its Subsidiary, such that, in any case, Arion or the
applicable Other Arion Entity will be solely benefited by and responsible for
such rights and obligations in respect of such Restricted Split Interest from
and after the Effective Time. Nothing in this Section 2.6 shall require Arion,
Sphinx or any of their Affiliates to pay any amount, grant any rights, grant
any guarantee or provide any other consideration to any third party or incur
additional costs or expenses in order to obtain any such Consent,
substitution, amendment, assignment, modification or novation; provided that
Sphinx agrees to provide any guarantee or other credit support required in
order to obtain such Consent, substitution, amendment, assignment,
modification or novation with respect to the Contract specified on Schedule
2.6(d) of the Sphinx Disclosure Letter, which guarantee or credit support
shall expire at the end of term of such Contract as of the Agreement Date. In
no event shall Sphinx, and Sphinx shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, (A)
commit to make any payments other than cash payments that are Excluded
Liabilities or otherwise paid in full prior to the Closing or (B) make any
non-monetary concession that would purport to bind Arion, its Subsidiaries,
the Business or any Purchased Entities following the Closing. In the event
that Sphinx determines to seek a novation with respect to any Assigned
Contract, then, subject to the same limitations under this Section 2.6(d)
applicable



to the Parties' obligations to seek a Consent, Arion shall, to the extent
permitted under applicable Law, reasonably cooperate with, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate with, Sphinx and the Other Sphinx
Entities (including, where necessary, entering into appropriate instruments of
assumption) to cause such novation to be obtained and to have Sphinx and the
Other Sphinx Entities released from all liability that constitutes Assumed
Liabilities to third parties with respect to such Assigned Contract, in each
case, to the extent consistent with the terms of this Agreement and with
effect to occur from and after Closing. With respect to any Assumed
Liabilities for which Sphinx, or any Subsidiary of Sphinx, has any material
secondary liability to third parties, Arion shall, upon the reasonable request
of Sphinx, provide Sphinx reasonable access and information in order for
Sphinx to ascertain continuing compliance by Arion and its Affiliates with all
material contract terms and conditions applicable to such material secondary
liability. Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Section 2.6 no
Party shall be required to take any action that (A) violates any contractual
obligation of such Party in effect as of the Agreement Date in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely impact such Party or
(B) violates applicable Law in any material respect.

(e) If any required Consent to Transfer Restricted Rights (or to replicate a
Shared Contract in respect thereof) is not obtained on or prior to the Closing
Date, then for 18 months following the Closing, the Parties shall continue to
use their reasonable best efforts to obtain such Consents in accordance with
Section 2.6(d). With respect to any Restricted Rights for which the Consent
Receipt Time has not occurred, the Parties hereby agree to implement such
reasonable arrangements (including subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting)
with respect to the underlying rights and obligations related thereto, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, as shall enable Arion or any other Arion
Entity, on and following the Closing Date, to (i) enjoy the benefits of the
applicable Restricted Asset or Restricted Split Interest, (ii) assume any
Liability (other than an Excluded Liability and solely to the extent they
would otherwise constitute Assumed Liabilities) arising from or related to any
such Restricted Rights on or after the Closing, including any Taxes to the
extent related thereto, as an Assumed Liability for purposes of this Agreement
to the same extent as would have been the case had such underlying Purchased
Assets and Split Interest been able to be Transferred to Arion at Closing and
(iii) if applicable, for Arion to perform (and Arion hereby agrees to perform)
the obligations of Sphinx or any applicable Other Sphinx Entity in respect
thereof (solely to the extent they would otherwise constitute Assumed
Liabilities), for no additional consideration, and for Arion to assume its
portion of the payment, performance and other obligations thereof from and
after the Effective Time in each case, to provide for Arion or the applicable
Other Arion Entity the same benefits and to otherwise place Arion, Sphinx and
their respective Subsidiaries in substantially the same after-Tax position
such parties would have been in had such Restricted Asset or Restricted Split
Interest been transferred at the Closing (such obligations, the "Subcontracted
Work"), until the earliest of (A) the Consent Receipt Time with respect to the
applicable Restricted Rights (or replication of the Shared Contract in respect
thereof) shall have been obtained and (B) in the case of a Restricted Asset
that is a Contract or a Restricted Split Interest, such time as such Contract
or Restricted Split Interest shall have lapsed, expired or not have been
renewed in accordance with its terms. Arion agrees to diligently perform and
discharge, and shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to perform and
discharge, the obligations of Sphinx and its Subsidiaries in connection with
any Subcontracted Work and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sphinx
and its Subsidiaries for any Losses arising out of or relating to (x) any
Purchased Assets held by Sphinx or any of the Other Sphinx Entities for the
benefit of Arion pursuant to any such arrangement and (y) any failure of Arion
and its Subsidiaries to perform and discharge such Subcontracted Work in
accordance with the terms set forth in this Section 2.6(e) (such indemnity,
the "Subcontracted Work Indemnity"), in each case except to the extent any of
the foregoing



constitute Excluded Liabilities or such Losses result from the gross
negligence, willful misconduct or intentional breach of Sphinx or its
Subsidiaries. Sphinx shall be permitted to set off against any amounts held
for the benefit of Arion pursuant to this arrangement all reasonable and
documented direct out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including Taxes and any
additional amounts sufficient to place Sphinx in the same after-Tax position
as it would have been had the underlying Purchased Assets and Split Interest
been able to be Transferred to Arion at Closing) associated with the retention
and maintenance of such Purchased Assets following the Closing. From and after
the Closing, to the extent permitted under applicable Law and for as long as
Sphinx and Arion maintain the arrangements described above, Sphinx shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, hold in trust (or such equivalent mechanism
permissible under local Law in each relevant jurisdiction) for and exercise at
the sole direction of Arion, and pay or deliver to Arion promptly upon receipt
thereof (as applicable), all benefits, rights, goods, services, income,
proceeds and monies received by, or provided to, Sphinx or its Subsidiaries as
provided in this Section 2.6(e). To the extent that a Consent to Transfer to
Arion with respect to a particular Restricted Asset or Restricted Split
Interest (or replicate the Shared Contract in respect thereof) is obtained
after the Closing Date, the Parties agree that such obligations relating
thereto will no longer be considered to be Subcontracted Work at such time,
but will, to the extent such obligations would have been deemed to be Assumed
Liabilities at the Closing, instead be deemed to be Assumed Liabilities for
all purposes of this Agreement. The Parties shall enter into such reasonable
arrangements, including with respect to Continuing Employees performing
services under any Restricted Asset or Restricted Split Interest, as are
necessary and appropriate to give effect to the arrangements provided for
under this Section 2.6(e).

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the provisions of this
Section 2.6 shall not apply to any Consent required under any Antitrust Laws,
which Consents shall be governed solely by Section 6.4.

(g) Arion acknowledges that certain Consents for the Purchase Transactions may
be required and that certain of such Consents may not be obtained.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the failure to
obtain any Consent (other than a Governmental Consent required to be obtained
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)) for the Transfer of any Purchased Shares or
Purchased Asset to Arion or its designated Affiliates, or the termination (or
receipt of notice of termination thereunder) of any Assigned Contract or
Shared Contract or any circumstances resulting from any of the foregoing,
shall not, in and of themselves, individually or in the aggregate, (i) give
rise to any Liability whatsoever of Sphinx arising out of or relating to such
failure, (ii) (A) constitute a Sphinx Material Adverse Effect, (B) a breach by
Sphinx of any representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement or any
of the other Transaction Documents or (C) a failure of any condition under
this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, including those in
Article 7 or (iii) cause or otherwise result in an adjustment to the Total
Consideration.

Section 2.7 Separate Transfer Jurisdictions. Each of Arion and Sphinx
acknowledges and agrees that, in each of certain jurisdictions as identified
in good faith between the Parties prior to the Closing Date (each such
jurisdiction, a "Separate Transfer Jurisdiction"), the Transfer of the
Business, including the Transfer of the Purchased Assets, Business Employees
and assumption of the Assumed Liabilities in such Separate Transfer
Jurisdiction (collectively the "Separate Transfer Business") shall not be
effectuated by this Agreement, but instead shall be effectuated subject to and
in accordance with the Local Transfer Agreement applicable to such Separate
Transfer Jurisdiction and the following:

(a) No Arion Party or Sphinx Party shall be obligated to execute or cause the
execution of the applicable Local Transfer Agreement associated with a
Separate Transfer Jurisdiction, nor



effect the Transfer of the related Separate Transfer Business, including the
Transfer of the Purchased Assets and Business Employees and assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities thereof, in each case, at the time of Closing should any
of the conditions set forth on Schedule 2.7(a) of the Sphinx Disclosure Letter
apply with respect to such Separate Transfer Jurisdiction (including for
avoidance of doubt, with respect to any Sphinx Pre-Closing Restructuring
Step).

(b) In the event any of the conditions described in Section 2.7(a) (each, a
"Delayed Transfer Condition") exist at the time of Closing with respect to any
Separate Transfer Business, the Parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to (i) make such filings and obtain any such required consents or
approvals, (ii) resolve any such prohibitions under applicable Law, (iii)
cause the expiration of any such mandatory waiting periods and (iv) complete
any such required notifications, consultations or negotiations, in each case
as is necessary for the Parties to resolve the applicable Delayed Transfer
Condition so that such Delayed Transfer Condition shall no longer apply, and
permit, as promptly as practicable, the execution of the applicable Local
Transfer Agreement and Transfer of the related Separate Transfer Business.
Sphinx shall bear all costs and expenses arising from the actions contemplated
in the preceding sentence and shall settle and reimburse Arion for any
obligations for any such costs and expenses paid by Arion for which Sphinx is
liable under this sentence promptly after being invoiced therefore by Arion.

(c) To the extent applicable, from the Closing Date until the date (if any) on
which any Separate Transfer Business is Transferred (with respect to such
Separate Transfer Business, the "Separate Transfer Date") pursuant to the
applicable Local Transfer Agreement, Sphinx, with the reasonable cooperation
of Arion, shall operate such Separate Transfer Business in the ordinary course
of business, taking into account the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in compliance with applicable Law and subject to the covenants of
Sphinx set forth in Section 6.1. In addition, prior to a Separate Transfer
Date and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Sphinx shall, and shall
cause each of its applicable Subsidiaries to, conduct such Separate Transfer
Business in the applicable Separate Transfer Jurisdiction in accordance with
Arion's instructions and for the sole benefit and sole detriment of Arion so
that all benefits and detriments attributable to such Separate Transfer
Business inure from and after the Closing solely to Arion. Arion shall
indemnify Sphinx for all costs and expenses arising from the operation of a
Separate Transfer Business pursuant to this Section 2.7(c) from and after the
Closing and through the Separate Transfer Date, except to the extent any of
the foregoing would constitute Excluded Liabilities and except for such
Liabilities or obligations arising as a result of the failure of Sphinx to
follow the instructions of Arion or as a result of a violation of this Section
2.7.

Section 2.8 Pre-Closing Restructuring.

(a) From time to time prior to the Closing Date, Sphinx shall perform
restructuring activities to effect the reorganization of legal entities to
separate the Business from Sphinx's other businesses as set forth on Schedule
2.8(a) of the Sphinx Disclosure Letter and to cause each of the Purchased
Entities to be treated as disregarded as an entity separate from its owner
under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3 prior to the Closing Date
(collectively, the "Sphinx Pre-Closing Restructuring Steps") in order to
consummate the Purchase Transactions at the Closing. All Taxes (other than
Transfer Taxes, which shall be borne one-half by each of Sphinx and Arion) and
other costs and expenses relating to such Sphinx Pre-Closing Restructuring
Steps shall be borne solely by Sphinx.



(b) From time to time prior to the Closing Date, Arion shall perform the steps
set forth on Schedule 2.8(b) of the Arion Disclosure Letter (collectively, the
"Arion Pre-Closing Restructuring Steps") and such other steps (including any
modifications or changes to the steps set forth on Schedule 2.8(b) of the
Arion Disclosure Letter) that are necessary in order to consummate the
Purchase Transactions at the Closing; provided that, Arion shall notify Sphinx
as soon as practicable prior to the Closing Date as to any such other steps
and consider in Arion's good faith discretion any reasonable comments made by
Sphinx with respect thereto. All Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes, which shall
be borne one-half by each of Sphinx and Arion) and other costs and expenses
relating to such Arion Pre-Closing Restructuring Steps shall be borne solely
by Arion.

(c) From time to time prior to the Closing Date, Arion may provide a written
request to Sphinx for (x) the formation of certain wholly-owned Subsidiaries
of Sphinx (such Subsidiaries, the "Acquisition Entities") prior to the Closing
or (y) the Transfer of certain Purchased Assets to certain Purchased Entities
and/or Acquisition Entities prior to Closing (collectively, the "Requested
Sphinx Restructuring Steps" and together with the Sphinx Pre-Closing
Restructuring Steps, the "Sphinx Pre-Closing Restructuring"). Sphinx shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Arion in good faith to form such
Acquisition Entities and effect such requested Transfers and other Requested
Sphinx Restructuring Steps prior to Closing and shall provide Arion with
documents, instruments and other evidence that each of the Purchased Entities
are treated as disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under Treasury
Regulation §301.7701-3 prior to the Closing Date and that the Sphinx Pre-
Closing Restructuring has been consummated in accordance with the Sphinx Pre-
Closing Restructuring Steps; provided that (i) Sphinx shall not be required to
take any Requested Sphinx Restructuring Steps to the extent that it would
violate applicable Law or any Contract of Sphinx or its Subsidiaries and (ii)
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses of any kind or
character (other than Transfer Taxes, which shall be borne one-half by each of
Sphinx and Arion) relating to or arising out of any Requested Sphinx
Restructuring Steps shall be borne by Arion.

Section 2.9 Transaction Committee; Integration Costs. Promptly after the
Agreement Date, a team consisting of three persons designated by Sphinx and
five persons designated by Arion (the "Transaction Committee") shall be
designated as the Transaction Committee of Arion and for the period between
the Agreement Date and the Closing Date, shall, among other things, develop
and oversee the execution of an integration plan with respect to the Business
and Arion Business and take other actions to consummate the Purchase
Transactions and establish the operations of Arion following the Closing and
combine the Business and the Arion Business and integrate their operations,
facilities, employee arrangements, IT infrastructure, insurance and other
operational matters, including those matters set forth on Schedule 2.9 of the
Arion Disclosure Letter (the "Transaction Committee Activities"). The costs
and expenses with respect to the Transaction Committee Activities will be
borne by Arion and at or promptly following the Closing, Arion shall reimburse
Sphinx for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred prior to the Closing to effect the Transaction Committee Activities.
Sphinx shall not authorize any Transaction Committee Activities that would
incur costs or expenses borne by Arion pursuant to this Section 2.9 without
the prior approval of either Arion or the Transaction Committee (including a
member thereto appointed by Arion). Until all authorizations, consents and
clearances, waivers and approvals of all relevant antitrust authorities under
the Antitrust Laws set forth on Section 2.9 have been obtained, the
Transaction Committee shall be organized as a "clean team" ensuring that no
information is exchanged between the operational divisions of the Parties
which would otherwise infringe any restrictions pursuant to any Antitrust
Laws.



ARTICLE 3 
PURCHASE PRICE

Section 3.1 Purchase Price. The total consideration for the Purchased Shares
and the Purchased Assets shall consist of (a) an amount equal to $950,000,000
(the "Base Purchase Price"), which shall be adjusted pursuant to Section 3.2
and Section 3.5 and may be modified pursuant to Section 6.16(g)), payable to
Sphinx in the form of cash, (b) the assumption by Arion of the Assumed
Liabilities and (c) the issuance by Arion of Arion Common Shares, constituting
30% of the Pro Forma Capitalization (but not giving effect to the Arion Common
Shares described in clauses (c) and (e) of the definition of "Pro Forma
Capitalization") (the Arion Common Shares so issued, the "Equity
Consideration" and together with clauses (a) and (b), collectively, the "Total
Consideration"). In the event Arion shall at any time following the Agreement
Date and prior to the earlier of (x) the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article 10 or (y) the Closing, pay any dividend on Arion Capital
Shares by the issuance of additional Arion Preferred Shares or issue any
additional Arion Preferred Shares then in each such case, the Equity
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to Sphinx the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

Section 3.2 Payment of Purchase Price.

(a) On the Closing Date, Arion shall issue the Equity Consideration and pay
the Estimated Cash Consideration to Sphinx (for Sphinx's own account and as
agent for any Other Sphinx Entity unless otherwise provided in any Local
Transfer Agreement or Sphinx otherwise notifies Arion of such other payee in
writing at least two Business Days prior to the Closing). The Estimated Cash
Consideration shall be payable in Dollars, in immediately available federal
funds and delivered by Arion to such bank account or accounts as shall be
designated in writing by Sphinx no later than two Business Days prior to the
Closing (or such later time as may be agreed by Sphinx and Arion). Any portion
of the Estimated Cash Consideration that is agreed by Arion and Sphinx to be
paid in a currency other than Dollars (as allocated pursuant to Section 3.3,
as required by applicable Law or otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties)
shall be converted from Dollars into the applicable other currency at the
Designated Exchange Rate and paid by, or on behalf of, Arion or the applicable
Other Arion Entity to Sphinx or the appropriate Other Sphinx Entity by wire
transfer to one or more bank accounts designated in writing by Sphinx no later
than two Business Days prior to the Closing (or such later time as may be
agreed by Sphinx and Arion) in lieu of the payment of such amount in Dollars
pursuant to this Section 3.2(a).

(b) No later than three Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
Sphinx shall prepare and deliver to Arion (x) the Closing Balance Sheet (as
defined in, and prepared in accordance with the Calculation Principles set
forth on, Appendix F) and (y) a written statement (the "Estimated Closing
Statement") setting forth Sphinx's good faith estimate of: (i) the estimated
amount of Business Cash as of the close of business on the Business Day
immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Estimated Business Cash"), (ii)
the estimated amount of Business Indebtedness outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Closing (the "Estimated Business Indebtedness"), (iii) the
estimated amount of Closing Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital") and the calculation thereof, (iv) the estimated amount of
Transaction Expenses (the "Estimated Transaction Expenses") and (v) the
estimated amount of Sphinx Transaction Expenses (the "Estimated Sphinx
Transaction Expenses"), in the case of each of clauses (i) through (iii),
calculated in accordance with the principles, policies and methodologies set
forth on Appendix F (collectively, the "Calculation Principles"), together
with, in the case of each of clauses (i) through (v), such supporting
documentation used to calculate or determine the foregoing amounts as Arion



may reasonably request. Sphinx shall take into consideration in good faith any
comments to the Estimated Closing Statement made by Arion within one Business
Day prior to the anticipated Closing Date; provided that Arion shall not have
any right to delay Closing or the payment of the Estimated Cash Consideration
as a result of any disagreement with such estimates set forth in the Estimated
Closing Statement.

(c) No later than three Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
Arion shall prepare and deliver to Sphinx a written statement setting forth
Arion's calculation of the Pro Forma Capitalization.

Section 3.3 Tax Treatment; Allocation of Purchase Price.

(a) For U.S. federal and applicable state income tax purposes, Sphinx and
Arion agree to, and agree to cause their Affiliates to, treat the acquisition
of the Purchased Shares as the taxable purchase of the assets of the Purchased
Entities and the purchase of the Purchased Assets as the taxable purchase of
the Purchased Assets.

(b) No later than 20 Business Days prior to Closing, Sphinx shall provide to
Arion a preliminary allocation of the Total Consideration (and, for purposes
of this Section 3.3 and the other Transaction Documents, the parties agree the
Equity Consideration has a fair market value as determined by Sphinx in its
sole good faith discretion and as notified in writing by Sphinx to Arion no
later than 20 Business Days prior to Closing) payable to Sphinx and each of
the Other Sphinx Entities in the case of the Sphinx and the Other Asset Sphinx
Entities, allocated based on the fair market value of the assets sold by each
of Sphinx and the Other Asset Sphinx Entities and, in the case of the Other
Share Sphinx Entities, allocated based on the fair market value of the
relevant Purchased Entity sold by such Other Share Sphinx Entity (the
"Preliminary Allocation"); provided that prior to delivery of the Preliminary
Allocation and from time to time following the Agreement Date and reasonably
in advance of the date on which the Preliminary Allocation is delivered,
Sphinx shall discuss such Preliminary Allocation with Arion and consider in
good faith Arion's reasonable comments on the Preliminary Allocation and use
reasonable best efforts to share with Arion information relevant to the
preparation of the Preliminary Allocation, including drafts thereof, as it
becomes available. The Preliminary Allocation shall be subject to Arion's
review and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). For purposes of the Transaction Documents, the
parties agree that the Equity Consideration shall be used for and allocated to
the purchase hereunder by Arion and Other Arion Entities of Purchased Assets
and Purchased Entities from Sphinx and the other Subsidiaries of Sphinx that
are organized in the United States.

(c) As soon as practicable after the Closing (and in any event within 120 days
of the Closing Date), Arion shall deliver to Sphinx a statement (the
"Allocation Statement") that allocates the Total Consideration among the
Purchased Shares and the Purchased Assets (and, where appropriate, the assets
of any Purchased Entity or Purchased Minority Interest) as of the Effective
Time in accordance with the allocation requirements of Section 1060 of the
Code (and any other applicable Tax Law) and in a manner consistent with the
principles used in the Preliminary Allocation as finally determined under
Section 3.3(a). Such Allocation Statement shall be adjusted to reflect any
changes to Closing Net Working Capital in accordance with the determination of
the Final Closing Net Working Capital under Section 3.5. If, within 30
Business Days after the delivery of the Allocation Statement, Sphinx notifies
Arion that Sphinx objects to the allocation set forth in the Allocation
Statement, Arion and Sphinx shall seek in good faith to resolve such dispute
within 30 Business Days. In the event that Arion and Sphinx are unable to
resolve such dispute within 30



Business Days, Sphinx and Arion shall jointly retain, and cooperate in good
faith with a mutually agreed, nationally recognized independent public
accounting firm as shall be mutually agreed by the Parties (the "Independent
Accountant") to resolve the disputed items. Upon resolution of the disputed
items, the allocation reflected in the Allocation Statement shall be adjusted
to reflect such resolution. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountant shall be allocated to be paid by Arion and Sphinx in inverse
proportion as they may each prevail on matters resolved by the Independent
Accountant, which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the
Independent Accountant at the time the determination of the Independent
Accountant is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. In the event
that Sphinx notifies Arion that it accepts the Allocation Statement, or does
not notify Arion of any objections to the Allocation Statement during such 30
Business Day period, Sphinx shall be considered to have accepted the accuracy
of the Allocation Statement delivered by Arion and such Allocation Statement
shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties. Any adjustments to
the Total Consideration paid by Arion in consideration for the sale and
purchase of the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Assets (including any
adjustments made pursuant to Section 3.2 and Section 3.5) shall be reflected
in the Allocation Statement in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (and any other similar
provisions under applicable Tax Law) and as mutually agreed by the Parties (it
being understood that no Party will unreasonably withhold, condition or delay
such agreement).

(d) For all Tax purposes, Sphinx and Arion (x) agree to report the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the
Allocation Statement and (y) will not take any position inconsistent therewith
in any Tax Return in any audit or refund claim, in any litigation or
otherwise, in each case with respect to a Taxing Authority, unless required to
do so by a Taxing Authority pursuant to the resolution of a Tax contest in
which the Allocation Statement has been defended diligently and in good faith.
Sphinx and Arion shall each be responsible for the preparation of their own
Section 1060 statements and forms in accordance with applicable Tax Laws and
in a manner consistent with the Allocation Statement, and each shall execute
and deliver to each other such statements and forms as are reasonably
requested by the other Party. In the event that the Allocation Statement is
disputed by any Taxing Authority, (i) the Party receiving notice of the
dispute shall promptly notify the other Party of such notice and (ii) both
Sphinx and Arion shall use reasonable efforts to defend the Allocation
Statement in any Proceedings or settle such dispute in a manner mutually
acceptable to Sphinx and Arion.

Section 3.4 Title Passage; Delivery of Purchased Shares and Purchased Assets.

(a) Title Passage. Upon the Closing (or, with respect to a Separate Transfer
Business, the Separate Transfer Date), all of the right, title and interest of
Sphinx and the Other Sphinx Entities, (including any risk of loss) in and to
all of the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Assets shall pass to Arion;
provided that Arion may elect (by prior written notice to Sphinx reasonably in
advance of the Closing and in no event later than 45 days after the Agreement
Date (provided that if the Closing has not occurred within 120 days after the
Agreement Date, such notice may be delivered no later than 30 days prior to
the date which Sphinx and Arion mutually determine in good faith is the
anticipated Closing Date) to require Sphinx or an Other Sphinx Entity to
convey any of the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Assets to an Other Arion
Entity rather than to Arion. Sphinx or such Other Sphinx Entity, as
applicable, shall comply with any such election by delivering to Arion or an
Other Arion Entity, as applicable, (i)(A) to the extent that such Purchased
Shares are in certificated form, certificates evidencing the Purchased Shares
duly endorsed in blank or with stock powers duly executed in proper form for
transfer or other procedure required by applicable Law, (B) to the extent



that such Purchased Shares are not in certificated form, stock powers or other
instruments of transfer duly executed in blank, and in either case with any
required stock transfer stamps affixed thereto and (C) in either case, any
short-form equity transfer agreements, forms, notarial deeds, instruments or
other similar documents necessary to transfer to Arion or the applicable Other
Arion Entity the Purchased Shares in accordance with the Laws of the
jurisdiction of organization, incorporation or formation of such Purchased
Entities or Purchased Minority Interests, in each case in a form mutually
acceptable to the Parties (the items described in clauses (A) through (C),
collectively, the "Equity Transfer Documents"); provided that, with respect to
Purchased Minority Interests, Sphinx or such Other Sphinx Entity, as
applicable, shall only be obligated to deliver such transfer documents or
instruments reasonably available to it and shall not be required to use any
efforts to obtain additional documentation from the Business Entities
associated with such Purchased Minority Interests, (ii) possession of such
Purchased Assets and (iii) any other certificates, forms, deeds, transfer
agreements or instruments required pursuant to any Transaction Document to
convey to Arion or an Other Arion Entity, as applicable, valid, good and
marketable title to all of the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Assets, free
and clear of all Liens, other than Sphinx Permitted Liens; provided that
Sphinx and the Other Sphinx Entities shall not be required to comply with such
election of Arion to the extent that Sphinx reasonably determines in good
faith that doing so would (x) violate applicable Law or any contractual
obligation of Sphinx or its Subsidiaries, (y) reasonably be expected to
prevent, impede or delay or make less likely to occur the consummation of the
Purchase Transactions or the other transactions contemplated hereby or by the
other Transaction Documents (or the satisfaction of the conditions in Article
7) or (z) impose unreasonable costs (including Taxes) on Sphinx and its
Subsidiaries which would be an Excluded Liability and for which it would not
be entitled to reimbursement under this Agreement; provided further that, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that clause (z) of the foregoing proviso shall
not apply, and Sphinx shall comply with Arion's election, with respect to the
jurisdictions set forth on Section 3.4 of the Arion Disclosure Letter. Sphinx
shall bear all costs and expenses arising from the actions contemplated by
this Section 3.4(a), other than Transfer Taxes (which shall be borne one-half
by each of Arion and Sphinx).

(b) Method of Delivery of Purchased Shares and Purchased Assets. The Purchased
Shares and the Purchased Assets shall be delivered to Arion or an Other Arion
Entity, as applicable, in the form and to the location mutually agreed by the
Parties before the Closing Date at Sphinx's cost and expense (other than with
respect to Transfer Taxes, which shall be borne one-half by each of Arion and
Sphinx); provided that, to the extent practicable, Sphinx shall deliver all of
the Purchased Assets through electronic delivery or in another manner
reasonably calculated and legally permitted to minimize or avoid the
incurrence of any Transfer Taxes if such method of delivery does not adversely
affect costs (including Taxes) of Sphinx and its Subsidiaries or the
condition, operability or usefulness of any Purchased Asset.

Section 3.5 Post-Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment; Other Adjustment.

(a) As promptly as practicable and in any event within 60 Business Days
following the Closing Date, Arion shall prepare and deliver to Sphinx a
written statement (the "Closing Statement") which will set forth Arion's
calculation of (i) the amount of Business Cash as of the close of business on
the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Closing Business
Cash"), (ii) the amount of Business Indebtedness outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Closing (the "Closing Business Indebtedness"), (iii) the amount
of Closing Net Working Capital, including the calculation thereof, (iv) the
amount of Transaction Expenses (the "Closing Transaction Expenses") and (v)
the amount of Sphinx Transaction Expenses (the "Closing Sphinx Transaction
Expenses"). The items set forth on the Closing Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with the Calculation Principles



and this Agreement. With respect to any items and amounts in the Estimated
Closing Statement that are not disputed by Arion in the Closing Statement,
Arion shall be deemed to have agreed with such items and amounts in the
Estimated Closing Statement and such items and amounts shall be final,
conclusive and binding upon the Parties.

(b) From the Closing Date through the Determination Date, Arion shall give,
and shall direct its Affiliates, representatives and auditors to give, Sphinx
and its Subsidiaries, and its representatives and auditors, upon reasonable
notice all such reasonable access (including electronic access, to the extent
available) during normal business hours (or such other times as the Parties
may agree) and in a manner that does not materially interfere with the conduct
of Arion's or its Subsidiaries' business or operations, as Sphinx may
reasonably require to the books and records of the Business and to the
appropriate Business Employees and other personnel or representatives of Arion
(including finance personnel) for purposes of evaluating the Closing Statement
and the adjustments and determinations contemplated therein.

(c) Within 45 Business Days after Sphinx's receipt of the Closing Statement,
Sphinx shall notify Arion whether it accepts or disputes the accuracy of the
Closing Statement. In the event that Sphinx disputes the accuracy of the
Closing Statement, Sphinx shall deliver a written notice to Arion specifying
in reasonable detail those items and amounts as to which Sphinx disagrees and
setting forth Sphinx's calculation of such disputed amounts (a "Dispute
Notice") and Sphinx shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and
amounts contained in the Closing Statement. In the event that Sphinx notifies
Arion that it accepts the Closing Statement, or does not deliver a Dispute
Notice to Arion, during such 45 Business Day period, Sphinx shall be
considered to have accepted the accuracy of the Closing Statement delivered by
Arion and such Closing Statement shall be final, conclusive and binding upon
the Parties.

(d) If a Dispute Notice shall be timely delivered by Sphinx pursuant to
Section 3.5(c), Sphinx and Arion shall, during the 20 Business Days following
such delivery (as such time period may be extended by the mutual agreement of
the Parties), seek in good faith to reach agreement on the disputed items and
amounts. If Arion and Sphinx resolve their differences over the disputed items
in the Closing Statement in accordance with the foregoing procedure, the
Closing Statement shall be revised to reflect such resolution and the amount
of the Closing Business Indebtedness, the Closing Business Cash, the Closing
Net Working Capital, the Closing Transaction Expenses and the Closing Sphinx
Transaction Expenses agreed upon by Sphinx and Arion reflected in such revised
Closing Statement shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties.

(e) If the Parties fail to resolve their differences over the disputed items
and amounts in the Closing Statement within such 20 Business Day period, then
Arion and Sphinx shall forthwith jointly request that the Independent
Accountant, make a binding determination only as to the disputed items and
amounts in the Closing Statement in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. The Independent Accountant will under the terms of its engagement
have no more than 20 Business Days from the date of referral within which to
render its written decision with respect to such disputed items and amounts.
The Independent Accountant shall consider only those items or amounts in the
Closing Statement as to which Sphinx and Arion have failed to reach agreement.
The Independent Accountant shall deliver to Sphinx and Arion a written report
setting forth its adjustments, if any, to the Closing Statement based on the
Independent Accountant's determination with respect to the disputed items and
amounts in accordance with this Agreement (including the definitions herein)
and the Calculation Principles and such report shall include the calculations
supporting such adjustments; provided that the Independent Accountant may not
assign a value to any item greater



than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by one of the Parties, in the case of
Arion, in the Closing Statement or in the case of Sphinx, in the Dispute
Notice. Such report shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties,
absent fraud or manifest error. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountant shall be allocated to be paid by Arion and Sphinx in inverse
proportion as they may each prevail on matters resolved by the Independent
Accountant, which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the
Independent Accountant at the time the determination of the Independent
Accountant is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted.

(f) The date on which the Closing Statement is finally determined in
accordance with this Section 3.5 shall be referred to as the "Determination
Date", the Closing Statement as so finally determined shall be referred to as
the "Final Closing Statement" and each of the Closing Business Cash, the
Closing Business Indebtedness, the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing
Transaction Expenses and the Closing Sphinx Transaction Expenses, as so
finally determined in the Final Closing Statement, shall be referred to as the
"Final Business Cash", the "Final Business Indebtedness", the "Final Closing
Net Working Capital", the "Final Transaction Expenses", and the "Final Sphinx
Transaction Expenses", respectively. As used herein, (i) the "Final Working
Capital Adjustment Amount" shall mean, (A) if the amount of the Final Closing
Net Working Capital is greater than the Closing Net Working Capital Upper
Collar, the dollar amount of such difference (expressed as a positive number)
and (B) if the amount of the Final Closing Net Working Capital is less than
the Closing Net Working Capital Lower Collar, the dollar amount of such
difference (expressed as a negative number), and (ii) the "Final Cash
Consideration" shall mean an amount equal to the sum of (A) the Purchase
Price, plus (B) the Final Business Cash, minus (C) the Final Business
Indebtedness, plus (D) the Final Working Capital Adjustment Amount, plus (E)
the Final Transaction Expenses, minus (F) the Final Sphinx Transaction
Expenses.

(g) Within five Business Days following the Determination Date, (i) if the
Estimated Cash Consideration exceeds the Final Cash Consideration (the amount
of such excess, the "Negative Adjustment Amount"), Sphinx shall pay to Arion
the Negative Adjustment Amount or (ii) if the Final Cash Consideration exceeds
the Estimated Cash Consideration (the amount of such excess, the "Positive
Adjustment Amount"), Arion shall pay Sphinx the Positive Adjustment Amount.
Any payment by Sphinx or Arion under this Section 3.5(g) shall be payable in
Dollars in immediately available federal funds and delivered to such bank
account or accounts as shall be designated in writing by Arion or Sphinx, as
the case may be, and such payments shall be accompanied by interest at a fixed
annual rate equal to the rate of interest from time to time announced publicly
by J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. as its prime rate and shall be calculated on
the basis of the actual days elapsed between the Closing Date and the payment
date based on a 365-day year.

(h) The process set forth in Section 3.5(e) shall be the exclusive remedy of
Sphinx and Arion for any disputes related to any amounts set forth on the
Closing Statement.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, to the extent
that, as of the Effective Time, any of the Purchased Entities have cash or
cash equivalents in a non-U.S. jurisdiction (taken together with all the cash
or cash equivalents in such non-U.S. jurisdiction held by other Purchased
Entities) in excess of the amounts set forth under the header "Business Cash
Limits" for such non-U.S. jurisdiction on Schedule 1.1(a)(ii) of the Sphinx
Disclosure Letter (after giving effect to increases to such "Business Cash
Limits", if any, made by Arion in its sole discretion) (such excess cash,
"Excess Cash"), for a period of 180 days following the Closing (and prior to
making any distributions of cash which constitutes Excess Cash to Arion or any
of its Subsidiaries



from the applicable Purchased Entity holding Excess Cash (it being understood
that Arion shall be free to distribute cash which does not constitute Excess
Cash at any time on or after the Closing), Arion shall use its reasonable best
efforts to, in reasonable consultation and cooperation with Sphinx, transfer
such Excess Cash (net of (x) any reasonable advisor fees, (y) direct or
indirect Taxes incurred or paid (including the reduction of attributes) and
(z) other reasonable costs incurred in connection with such transfer) to the
Sphinx Party that held the shares of the Purchased Entity immediately prior to
Closing; provided that Arion shall not be required to transfer such Excess
Cash in the event that such transfer would be prohibited or restricted by
applicable Law or create negative distributable reserves (or any similar
concept in which would apply to the Purchased Entity in such non-U.S.
jurisdiction).

Section 3.6 Withholding.

(a) Each Party shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld under applicable Law (such
Party that deducts and withholds, the "Withholding Party"). The Withholding
Party shall timely pay the full amount so deducted or withheld to the relevant
Governmental Authority, in accordance with applicable Law. As soon as
practicable after any such payment, the Withholding Party shall deliver to the
other Party the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by the
relevant Governmental Authority (if any) evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to such other Party.

(b) Sphinx shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and Arion shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate in good faith to minimize any
withholding that may be applied to any payments described in this Section 3.6.

(c) To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld under this Section
3.6, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents as having been paid by the Withholding Party to
the other Party to the extent so paid to the appropriate Governmental
Authority.

Except as set forth specifically on the disclosure letter delivered by Sphinx
on the Agreement Date and attached hereto (the "Sphinx Disclosure Letter")

moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights
generally, and general equitable principles.

Entities, except, in the cases of subclauses (ii) and (iii), where such
violation, breach, conflict, default, right of termination or cancellation,
acceleration, loss of benefit, failure to obtain Consent or Lien would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Sphinx
Material Adverse Effect.

(a) Each Purchased Entity is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each Purchased
Entity has the requisite corporate, partnership or similar power and authority
to own or lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on the
business it now conducts in all material respects. Each Purchased Entity is
duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except to the

Purchased Asset, to it, and, to the knowledge of Sphinx, no such individuals
are in violation of any such agreements. No Sphinx Party has, in the previous

(h) Open Source Software. To the knowledge of Sphinx, the Sphinx Parties have
complied with the conditions of any licenses for any Open Source Software that
is incorporated into or bundled with any Products. To the knowledge of Sphinx,
no past or current use of Open Source Software requires or creates obligations
that any Software, or portion of component thereof, owned by any Sphinx Party
and included in the Transferred Technology be licensed, made available,
offered, delivered or disclosed in any way to any third party or immunizing
any third party, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material to the Business.

(i) Software. The Sphinx Parties have exercised commercially reasonable
efforts to protect all Software and Products owned by any Sphinx Party and

or intent of the computer user), "time bombs," "key locks" or any other code
that could disrupt, disable, or otherwise interfere with the



operation of such Software or Products or the integrity of the data,
information or signals used or produced by such Software or Products. No
Sphinx Party has provided or disclosed the source code of any such Software,

experienced any incident in which confidential or sensitive information,

respect thereto.

policy. Within the past three years, neither Sphinx nor any of its
Subsidiaries has implemented any employee layoffs that could implicate the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 or any similar or
related Law (collectively, the "WARN Act") or any similar action requiring
notification to or consultation with employees working in the Business or
their representatives.

(c) Except as described in Schedule 4.12(d) of the Sphinx Disclosure Letter,
there is not, and for the past three years there has not been: (i) any strike,
material grievance, arbitration, slowdown, picketing, work stoppage or
material labor dispute related to, or involving, employees working in the
Business, and to the knowledge of Sphinx, none are threatened; (ii) any
collective bargaining agreement, works council or labor Contract related or
otherwise applicable to the Business or employees working in the Business; and
(iii) to the knowledge of Sphinx, any union organization effort with respect
to the Business or employees working in the Business and none are threatened.

(d) With respect to each Sphinx Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code, such Sphinx Benefit Plan is so qualified, and has timely
received a determination letter, advisory or opinion letter from the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service, and no act or omission has occurred which could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect such Sphinx Benefit Plan's
qualification. Each Sphinx Benefit Plan and each related trust, insurance
Contract and fund has been established, maintained, funded, and administered
in accordance with its terms and complies in form and in operation in all
material respects with applicable Law. None of Sphinx, the Other Sphinx
Entities nor to the knowledge of Sphinx, any other Person has engaged in any
transaction, including any nonexempt "prohibited transactions" as such term is
defined in Section 406 of ERISA or



Section 4975 of the Code or any breach of fiduciary duty (as determined under
ERISA) with respect to any Sphinx Benefit Plan that would subject Arion or any
of its Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities following the Closing) to
any Tax, Liability or penalty (civil or otherwise). No Proceedings, audits,
investigations or claims are pending (other than routine undisputed claims for
benefits), or to the knowledge of Sphinx, threatened with respect to any
Sphinx Benefit Plan. Sphinx has made available to Arion, with respect to each
material Sphinx Benefit Plan, to the extent applicable: (i) a copy of the
current plan documents (with any amendments thereto), or if unwritten, a
written description of the material terms, (ii) a copy of the most recent
determination, advisory or opinion letter from the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service, and (iii) the most recent financial statements, actuarial reports,
and annual report (Form 5500 series).

(e) Each of Sphinx and its Subsidiaries has satisfied, or will satisfy prior
to Closing, all notice, consultation, information, and bargaining obligations
owed to any Business Employee or to any labor union, works council, or labor
organization representing any Business Employee or with respect to the
Business, in connection with the execution of this Agreement, the Sphinx Pre-
Closing Restructuring, or consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(f) None of Sphinx, the Other Sphinx Entities, or any of their ERISA
Affiliates, nor any predecessor thereof, sponsors, maintains or contributes
to, or in the past six years prior to the Agreement Date has sponsored,
maintained or contributed to, and no Sphinx Benefit Plan is or was a
multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA or a defined
benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(35) of ERISA that, in each case,
could reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of any Liability to
Arion or any of its Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities following the
Closing). None of Sphinx, the Other Sphinx Entities or any of their ERISA
Affiliates has incurred any unsatisfied Liability (including withdrawal
Liability) under, and, no circumstances exist that could reasonably be
expected to result in any Liability to Sphinx, any Other Sphinx Entity or any
of their ERISA Affiliates under, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code
or Section 302 of ERISA that could become a Liability on Arion or any of its
Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities following the Closing), including
as a consequence of at any time being considered a single employer under
Section 414 of the Code with any other Person.

(g) No Purchased Entity or Sphinx Benefit Plan has any Liability to provide or
has any Liability with respect to an obligation to provide, medical, dental or
life insurance coverage or any other welfare benefits after termination of
employment in respect of any Business Employees, except as may be required
under foreign Law, or Section 4980B of the Code for which the recipient pays
the full cost of coverage.

(h) Each Sphinx Benefit Plan that constitutes a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been
operated and maintained, in form and operation, in accordance in all material
respects with Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance of the
Department of Treasury and Revenue Services; no amount with respect to any
Business Employee under any such Sphinx Benefit Plan is or has been subject to
the interest and additional tax set forth under Section 409A(1)(B) of the
Code; no Sphinx Party has any obligation to any Business Employee to gross-up,
indemnify or otherwise reimburse any Business Employee with respect to any
Tax, including under Sections 409A or 4999 of the Code; and no Sphinx Party is
a party to any Contract or plan that has resulted or could result, separately
or in the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess parachute payment" to any
Business Employee within the meaning of Code Section 280G (or any
corresponding provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax law) as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(i) Except as described in Schedule 4.12(j) of the Sphinx Disclosure Letter,
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and the consummation of the transactions hereunder and thereunder
(including the consummation of the Purchase Transactions, either alone or
together with any other event) will not, directly or indirectly, (i) entitle
any Business Employee to extra statutory severance pay under any Sphinx
Benefit Plan or otherwise exceeding the minimum severance required by
applicable Law (except to the extent provided under Section 6.7(h) upon a
Qualifying Termination (as defined in Section 6.7(h)) that occurs following
the Closing), (ii) result in any payment (whether in cash, property or the
vesting of property) becoming due, accelerate the time of payment, funding or
vesting of compensation or benefits, or increase the amount of compensation or
benefits due to any Business Employee under any Sphinx Benefit Plan or
otherwise, or (iii) result in any forgiveness of Indebtedness, trigger any
funding obligation under any Sphinx Benefit Plan that is sponsored or
maintained by a Purchased Entity. None of Sphinx or any of its Subsidiaries
have any obligations to Business Employees for (A) "single-trigger" severance
rights or (B) any sale, change in control, transaction, success-based or
transition bonuses, in the case of each of clause (A) and (B), which are
triggered solely by or payable solely as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than any such obligations
which are Excluded Liabilities.

(j) Except as described in Schedule 4.12(k) of the Sphinx Disclosure Letter,
with respect to each Sphinx Benefit Plan established or maintained outside of
the United States for the benefit of Business Employees primarily employed
outside of the United States (each a "Sphinx Foreign Benefit Plan"): (i) all
employer and employee contributions required by applicable Law or by the terms
of such Sphinx Foreign Benefit Plan have been timely made, or if applicable,
accrued in accordance with normal accounting practices; (ii) no Sphinx Foreign
Benefit Plan is a defined benefit pension plan, final salary plan or provides
any death, disability or other benefit calculated by reference to age, salary
or length of service, or has any unfunded or underfunded liabilities or
obligations; and (iii) each Sphinx Foreign Benefit Plan required to be
registered has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with
the applicable Governmental Authority; and (iv) each Sphinx Foreign Benefit
Plan that is intended to qualify for tax-preferential treatment under
applicable Law so qualifies and has received, where required, approval from
the applicable Governmental Authority that it is so qualified and no event has
occurred or circumstance exists that may give rise to disqualification or loss
of tax-preferential treatment.

Section 4.13 Real Property.

(a) Schedule 4.13(a) of the Sphinx Disclosure Letter sets forth a list, as of
the Agreement Date, of the Business Real Property, including all Business
Leases and Real Property Leases executed on or prior to the Agreement Date,
even if such Contract does not come into effect until a later date. Each of
Sphinx, the Other Asset Sphinx Entities and the Purchased Entities, as
applicable, has good and valid leasehold interests in or good, marketable,
indefeasible fee simple title to, as applicable, all its Business Real
Property (in each case, other than those assets and interests disposed of
since the Agreement Date in the ordinary course of business and in accordance
with this Agreement) free and clear of any Liens other than Sphinx Permitted
Liens. All Real Property Leases and Business Leases for the Business Real
Property are in full force and effect, constitute legal, valid and binding
obligations of Sphinx, an Other Sphinx Entity or a Purchased Entity, as
applicable, and to the knowledge of Sphinx, the other parties thereto, and
such Contracts are enforceable in accordance with their respective terms,
subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or
affecting creditors' rights generally, and general equitable principles,
except as would not, individually or in the



aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Sphinx Material Adverse Effect.
There exists no breach, default or event of default (or occurrence or event
that with notice or lapse of time or both would result in a breach, default or
event of default) under any Real Property Lease or Business Lease (or any
lease underlying a Business Lease) by Sphinx, an Other Sphinx Entity or a
Purchased Entity, as applicable, or, to the knowledge of Sphinx as of the
Agreement Date, any other party thereto, except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Business.

(b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Business, none of Sphinx, any Other Sphinx
Entity or any Purchased Entity has within the three years prior to the
Agreement Date given to or received from any other Person any written notice
(i) regarding any actual, alleged, possible, or potential breach of, or
default under, any lease agreement in respect of any Business Real Property or
(ii) announcing or threatening termination or cancellation of any lease
agreement in respect of any Business Real Property.

(c) No Purchased Entity has an interest in any real property that is not
Business Real Property or real properties set forth on Schedule 4.13(c) of the
Sphinx Disclosure Letter.

as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
material to the Business, as of the Agreement Date (i) there are no
condemnation or eminent domain proceedings or compulsory purchase pending or,
to the knowledge of Sphinx, threatened that would interfere with the present
use of the Business Real Property, and (ii) none of Sphinx, any Other Asset
Sphinx Entity or any Purchased Entity has leased, subleased or licensed to any
Person any Business Real Property to any Person (other than to a Purchased
Entity). No Purchased Entity is obligated under any Contract (and there is no
Assigned Contract) to purchase any real property or interest therein.

Section 4.14 Fair Consideration; No Fraudulent Conveyance. The Transfer of the
Purchased Assets and Purchased Shares to Arion as contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents is made in exchange for fair and
equivalent consideration, and neither Sphinx nor any Other Sphinx Entity is
now insolvent nor will be rendered insolvent by the Transfer of the Purchased
Assets and Purchased Shares as contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents. Neither Sphinx nor any Other Sphinx Entity is entering
into this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby with the intent to
defraud, delay or hinder its creditors and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the other Transaction
Documents will not have any such effect. The transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document will not give rise to any right of
any creditor of Sphinx or any Subsidiary of Sphinx to assert any claim for
fraudulent conveyance against Arion, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the
Purchased Assets or Purchased Shares in the hands of Arion or any of their
respective successors and assigns following the Closing.

Section 4.15 Sufficiency of Assets.

(a) Sphinx or one of the Other Asset Sphinx Entities has, and Arion or the
relevant Other Arion Entity will at the Closing acquire, good, valid and
marketable title to the Purchased Assets (or in the case of leased Purchased
Assets, valid leasehold interests in such leased Purchased Assets), free and
clear of all Liens except Sphinx Permitted Liens and Liens arising solely out
of any actions of Arion and its Affiliates. Each Purchased Entity has good,
valid and marketable title to all of its assets (or in the case of leased
assets, valid leasehold interests in such leased assets), free and clear of
all Liens except Sphinx Permitted Liens and Liens arising solely out of
actions of Arion



and its Affiliates. The Tangible Assets (including the tangible assets of each
Purchased Entity) are in good working condition and repair, ordinary wear and
tear excepted, and are suitable for the purposes for which they are presently
used.

(b) The Purchased Assets and the assets, properties and rights that will be
owned, leased or licensed by the Purchased Entities immediately following the
Closing, together with the assets, services, rights and other obligations that
will be Transferred, leased, licensed or otherwise provided pursuant to the
Transaction Documents constitute (x) all material assets, properties and

headcount or staffing level reductions implemented by Arion, and (vi)
Restricted Rights (until Transferred pursuant to Section 2.6 of this
Agreement); provided that (A) Arion owns or forms Business Entities as
required by applicable local Law to receive the Purchased Assets and Purchased
Shares as contemplated by this Agreement and that such Business Entities
obtain such necessary corporate qualifications to do business in such
jurisdiction and (B) this Section 4.15 does not address and will not be
construed as a representation or warranty of Sphinx regarding infringement or
misappropriation of any Intellectual Property Rights, which are addressed by
Section 4.7.

effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other
Transaction Documents, from March 31, 2017 through the Agreement Date, (a)

Sphinx Material Adverse Effect, (b) the Business has been conducted in the
ordinary course consistent with past practice in all material respects and (c)
none of Sphinx, any Other Sphinx Entity or any Purchased Entity or, to the

ARTICLE 5 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ARION

Except as set forth specifically on the disclosure letter delivered by Arion
on the Agreement Date and attached hereto (the "Arion Disclosure Letter" and
together with the Sphinx Disclosure Letter, the "Disclosure Letters") (with
the disclosure in any section or subsection of the Arion Disclosure Letter
being deemed to qualify or apply to other sections and subsections of this
Article 5 to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure that such disclosure should qualify or apply to such other sections
and subsections), Arion represents and warrants to Sphinx as follows:

Section 5.1 Corporate Existence. Each of Arion and each Other Arion Entity is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of organization. Each of Arion and each Other Arion Entity has
the requisite corporate, partnership or similar power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and each other Transaction
Document to which it is a party and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and to own, lease or otherwise hold the
Purchased Assets, own the Purchased Shares and to assume the Assumed
Liabilities, and to carry on the Business in substantially the same manner as
the same is now being conducted by Sphinx and its Subsidiaries. With respect
to the Business, each of Arion and each Other Arion Entity is duly qualified
to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except to



the extent such failure to be so qualified would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an Arion Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.2 Corporate Authority. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which Arion or any Other Arion Entity is (or becomes) a party and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby involving
such Persons, including the issuance of the Equity Consideration and the
adoption of the Arion Charter Amendment and the filing thereof concurrently
with or immediately prior to the Closing, have been duly authorized by Arion
and will be duly authorized by each applicable Other Arion Entity by all
requisite corporate, limited liability company, partnership or other action
prior to Closing and no other Proceedings on the part of Arion or its
stockholders are (and no other Proceedings on the part of any Other Arion
Entity or any of its equity holders will be) necessary for Arion or any Other
Arion Entity to authorize the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any
of the other Transaction Documents or to perform any of their obligations
hereunder or thereunder, or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, including the issuance of the Equity Consideration and the
adoption of the Arion Charter Amendment and the filing thereof concurrently
with or immediately prior to the Closing. Arion has, and each of the Other
Arion Entities will have at or prior to the Closing, full corporate or other
organizational (as applicable) power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and to
perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Arion, and the other Transaction Documents will be
duly executed and delivered by Arion and any Other Arion Entity party thereto
at or prior to the Closing. Assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by Sphinx or the relevant Other Sphinx Entity of this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document, as applicable, this Agreement constitutes, and
the other Transaction Documents when so executed and delivered will
constitute, a valid and legally binding obligation of Arion and/or any Other
Arion Entity, enforceable against it or them, as the case may be, in
accordance with its terms except as enforceability may be affected by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and
general equitable principles.

Section 5.3 Governmental Approvals and Consents; Non-Contravention.

(a) Other than the filing of the Arion Charter Amendment pursuant to Section
8.2, no Consent, order, or license or permit from, notice to or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required on the part
of Arion or any of its Affiliates in connection with the execution, delivery
or performance of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except
(i) such filings and notifications as may be required under the HSR Act and
other applicable Antitrust Laws, (ii) such filings and notifications as may be
required under the FATA and (iii) to the extent the failure to obtain such
Consent, order or license or effect such notice to or registration,
declaration or filing with such Governmental Authority would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an Arion Material Adverse
Effect.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents by Arion and/or each of the Other Arion Entities, the performance by
Arion and each of the Other Arion Entities of its respective obligations
hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by Arion and each of the Other
Arion Entities of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and
will not (without notice or lapse of time, or both) (i) violate or conflict
with or result in any breach or default under any provision of the respective
Organizational Documents of Arion or any Other Arion Entity, (ii) result in
any violation or breach of, or constitute any default under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or a loss
of a benefit under, or



require that any Consent be obtained with respect to, or result in the
imposition of any Lien (other than an Arion Permitted Lien) under, any
material Permit or Arion Material Contract, or (iii) assuming compliance with
the matters described in Section 5.3(a), violate, conflict with or result in
any breach or default under any provision of any Law applicable to Arion
and/or any Other Arion Entity or any of their respective properties or assets,
except, in the cases of subclauses (ii) and (iii), where such violation,
breach, conflict, default, right of termination or cancellation, acceleration,
loss of benefit, failure to obtain Consent or Lien would not, individually or

Effect.

judgment, stipulation, injunction or decree of any Governmental Authority
which would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially interfere with or
delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents. No Proceeding is pending or, to
the knowledge of Arion, threatened against Arion or any of its Subsidiaries
which, if adversely determined, would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially interfere with or delay the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

Intellectual Property Rights (the "Arion Registered IPR"), and indicates for
each item the registration and application numbers and dates, the applicable
filing jurisdiction, title, registered owner, and the status of such
application or registration, as applicable. All necessary filing, examination,
registration, maintenance and renewal fees currently due in connection with
such Arion Registered IPR have been made, and all necessary documents,
recordations, affidavits and certificates in connection with such Arion
Registered IPR



have been timely filed with the relevant authorities in the United States or
applicable foreign jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the purposes of
prosecuting, registering or maintaining such Arion Registered IPR, except in
each case as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be

Registered IPR is being contested or challenged.

(b) Ownership of Intellectual Property Rights. The Arion Parties own all
right, title and interest in and to the Arion Intellectual Property Rights
free and clear of any Liens (other than Arion Permitted Liens), except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
material to the Arion Business. No Arion Party has granted exclusive licenses
under any of the Arion Intellectual Property Rights to a third party. Each
Arion Party has used commercially reasonable efforts to implement and enforce
a policy of (i) obtaining from all current and former employees, and all
consultants and independent contractors, a binding confidentiality agreement
and (ii) obtaining from all current and former employees and all consultants
and independent contractors that have been engaged by it to develop
Intellectual Property Rights for the Arion Business, executed written
agreements that, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, assign (by way of
a present assignment) all rights, title and interest in and to any such
Intellectual Property Rights and Technology and, to the knowledge of Arion, no
such individuals are in violation of any such agreements. No Arion Party has,
in the previous three years, transferred ownership of, or agreed to transfer
ownership of, any Intellectual Property Right or Technology to any third party
that, if transferred, would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Arion Business. Each Arion Party has taken
commercially reasonable security measures to protect the secrecy,
confidentiality and value of all Trade Secrets used in or held for the benefit
of the Arion Business.

(c) Government and Standards Bodies. To the knowledge of Arion, no funding,
facilities or resources of a government or university, college or other
educational institution or research center were used in the creation, design
or development of any Arion Intellectual Property Rights in such a way that
would grant such Person ownership rights therein. No Arion Party has made any
contribution to any standards setting organization that requires or creates
obligations that it license or offer a license to any Arion Intellectual
Property Rights, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material to the Arion Business.

(d) No Infringement. To the knowledge of Arion, the conduct of the Arion
Business does not infringe or misappropriate, and in the three years prior to

aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Arion Business.

(e) No Proceedings. No Proceedings before any Governmental Authority or
arbitrator have been filed against any Arion Party, and no Arion Party has
received written notice in the three years prior to the Agreement Date: (i)
challenging the scope, ownership, validity or enforceability of the Arion
Intellectual Property Rights or (ii) alleging that the conduct of the Arion
Business infringes or misappropriates the Intellectual Property Rights of any
third party.

(f) No Infringement of Transferred Intellectual Property Rights. To the
knowledge of Arion, no Person has infringed or misappropriated, or is
infringing or misappropriating, any Arion Intellectual Property Rights in any
material respect and no Arion Party has brought or threatened in



the three years prior to the Agreement Date any action against any third party
based on any allegations of such infringement or misappropriation.

(g) Third-Party Software. Schedule 5.7(g) of the Arion Disclosure Letter
identifies each Contract pursuant to which Arion has licensed from another
Person any third-party owned Software (other than Software that is the subject
of a Arion Ordinary Course Inbound License) that is incorporated into,
embedded in, or distributed for use with any Arion products.

(h) Open Source Software. To the knowledge of Arion, the Arion Parties have
complied with the conditions of any licenses for any Open Source Software that
is incorporated into or bundled with any Arion products. To the knowledge of
Arion, no past or current use of Open Source Software requires or creates
obligations that any Software, or portion of component thereof, owned by any
Arion Party be licensed, made available, offered, delivered or disclosed in
any way to any third party or immunizing any third party, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the
Arion Business.

(i) Software. The Arion Parties have exercised commercially reasonable efforts
to protect all Software and products owned by any Arion Party that is material
to the conduct of the Arion Business as currently conducted from harmful code,
including self-replicating and self-propagating programming instructions
commonly called "viruses" or "worms" (which has the ability to damage,
interfere with or otherwise adversely affect computer programs, data files or
hardware without the consent or intent of the computer user), "time bombs,"
"key locks" or any other code that could disrupt, disable, or otherwise
interfere with the operation of such Software or products or the integrity of
the data, information or signals used or produced by such Software or
products. No Arion Party has provided or disclosed the source code of any such
Software, except pursuant to the terms of a license agreement or non-
disclosure obligations, in each case as appropriate and customary for the
transaction, or had any such source code released from escrow, under any
source code escrow agreement or arrangement to any third party.

(j) IT Disruptions. To the knowledge of Arion, in the three years prior to the
Agreement Date, there have been no failures, breakdowns or continued
substandard performance of the Arion IT Assets that have caused any
substantial disruption or interruption in or use of the Arion IT Assets as a
whole or with respect to any portion thereof.

(k) Personal Information. The conduct of the Arion Business complies in all
material respects with (i) all Privacy Laws applicable to its collection, use,
processing, storage, retention, disposal and onward transfer of Personal
Information and (ii) all terms of customer Contracts and other Contracts
relating to Personal Information and Privacy Laws. The Arion Business has
displayed a privacy policy on its web site that discloses to site users how
the Arion Business collects, uses and transfers Personal Information from such
users, and in the three years prior to the Agreement Date, the Arion Parties
have complied with the Arion Business' privacy policy as updated from time to
time in all material respects and all Privacy Laws.

(l) Security Breaches. In the last three years, the Arion Business has not
experienced any incident in which confidential or sensitive information,
payment card data, personally identifiable information, or other protected
information relating to individuals was or is reasonably expected to have been
stolen or improperly accessed, and none of Arion or any of its Subsidiaries
has received any written notices or complaints from any Person with respect
thereto.



Section 5.8 Tax Matters.

(a) To the extent that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to result
in a Lien (other than an Arion Permitted Lien) on, any of the material assets,
properties or rights of Arion or otherwise result in Arion having any
liability for payment of any amount, Arion and each of its Subsidiaries has
timely filed or caused to be timely filed all material Tax Returns that any
such entity was required to file on or prior to the Closing Date and has
timely paid all material Taxes due and owing whether or not shown on any Tax
Return. All such Tax Returns were complete and accurate in all material
respects and were prepared in substantial compliance with applicable Law.

(b) To the extent that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to result
in a Lien (other than an Arion Permitted Lien) on, any of the assets,

amount, Arion and each of its Subsidiaries has withheld all material Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to their respective employees or any

Tax Returns of Arion or any of Arion's Subsidiaries.

(e) There are no outstanding Tax Liens against any of the assets, properties
or rights of any of Arion or any of Arion's Subsidiaries (other than Arion
Permitted Liens). No claims, deficiencies, or proposed adjustments are

to any Taxes related to the assets, properties or rights of Arion or any of
its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to result in a Lien (other
than an Arion Permitted Lien) on any of the assets, properties or rights of
Arion or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in Arion or any of its
Subsidiaries having any material liability for payment of any material amount.

(f) None of Arion or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any
agreement or arrangement providing for the allocation, indemnification or
sharing of Taxes nor does Arion or any of its Subsidiaries have any
obligations to another Person under any such agreement, other than a contract
or agreement entered into in the ordinary course of business the primary
purpose of which was not the sharing of Taxes.

(g) None of Arion or any of Subsidiaries is, or has been, a party to any

be expected to be material to the Arion Business. Within the past three year-
period, neither Arion nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written or,
to the knowledge of Sphinx, verbal notice from any Governmental Authority

schedules, annexes and amendments thereto (the "Debt Financing Commitment"),
pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of which, the Debt
Financing Sources have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to
Arion for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (such committed financing, together with, unless the context
otherwise requires, any debt securities issued in lieu thereof, the "Debt

Indebtedness outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing Date (the
"Prepayment"), (iii) the payment of any Arion Transaction Expenses and (iv)
any payments by Arion or its Subsidiaries to any of its Affiliates owing as of
or in connection with the Closing (to the extent not irrevocably waived),

force and effect and has not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated, or
otherwise amended or modified in any respect and (ii) the Debt Financing
Commitment, in the form so delivered, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Arion and, to the knowledge of Arion, the other parties thereto,
enforceable against it or them, as the case may be, in accordance with its
terms except as enforceability may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, and general equitable
principles. Except for fee letters (the "Fee Letters") with respect to fees
and related arrangements with respect to the Debt Financing, of which Arion

(c) As of the Agreement Date, assuming the accuracy of Sphinx's Fundamental
Representations (other than Section 4.15(b)) and the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 4.11, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on
the part of Arion under any term or condition of the Debt Financing Commitment
or, to the knowledge of Arion, would (i) make any of the assumptions or any of
the statements set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment inaccurate in any
material respect, (ii) result in any of the conditions in the Debt Financing
Commitment not being satisfied or (iii) otherwise result in the Debt Financing
not being available on the Closing Date. As of the Agreement Date, no Debt
Financing Source party to the Debt Financing Commitment has notified Arion of
its intention to terminate the Debt Financing Commitment or not to provide the
Debt Financing. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions in Section 7.1 and
Section 7.3, and the accuracy of Sphinx's Fundamental Representations (other
than Section 4.15(b)) and the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4.11, as of the Agreement Date, Arion has no reason to believe that
any of the conditions in the Debt Financing Commitment will fail to be
satisfied on a timely basis or that the full amounts committed pursuant to the
Debt Financing Commitment will not be available to be funded at the Closing.

(d) Arion has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees or
other fees required by the Debt Financing Commitment to be paid on or before
the Agreement Date. The aggregate proceeds from the Debt Financing constitute
all of the financing required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Prepayment) and, when taken
together with the Arion Cash held by Arion Opco as of the Closing Date (after
giving effect to any Affiliate Payments that have not been irrevocably
waived), are sufficient in amount for Arion to pay the Estimated Cash
Consideration, fund the Post-Closing Operating Cash, pay the Arion Transaction
Expenses and pay all other associated fees, costs and expenses in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Required Amount").
The Debt Financing Commitment contains all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of the parties thereunder to make the Debt Financing available to
Arion on the terms and subject only to the conditions set forth therein.

(e) Arion's obligation to consummate the Purchase Transactions is not
contingent on Arion's ability to obtain any financing, including pursuant to
the Debt Financing Commitment.

Section 5.13 Employees; Employee Benefits.

(a) Except as described in Schedule 5.13(b) of the Arion Disclosure Letter,
there is not, and for the past three years there has not been: (i) any strike,
material grievance, arbitration, slowdown, picketing, work stoppage or
material labor dispute related to, or involving, employees working in the
Arion Business, and to the knowledge of Arion, none are threatened; (ii) any
collective bargaining agreement, works council or labor Contract related to or
otherwise applicable to the Arion Business or employees working in the Arion
Business; and (iii) to the knowledge of Arion, any union organization effort
with respect to the Arion Business or employees working in the Arion Business
and none are threatened.



(b) With respect to each Arion Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code, such Arion Benefit Plan is so qualified, and has timely
received a determination letter, advisory or opinion letter from the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service, and no act or omission has occurred which could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect such Arion Benefit Plan's
qualification. Each Arion Benefit Plan and each related trust, insurance
Contract and fund has been established, maintained, funded, and administered
in accordance with its terms and complies in form and in operation in all
material respects with applicable Law. None of Arion, any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the knowledge of Arion, any other Person has engaged in any
transaction, including any nonexempt "prohibited transactions" as such term is
defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or any breach of
fiduciary duty (as determined under ERISA) with respect to any Arion Benefit
Plan that would subject Arion or any of its Affiliates to any Tax, Liability
or penalty (civil or otherwise). No Proceedings, audits, investigations or
claims are pending (other than routine undisputed claims for benefits), or to
the knowledge of Arion, threatened with respect to any Arion Benefit Plan.

(c) None of Arion, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates,
nor any predecessor thereof, sponsors, maintains or contributes to, or in the
past six years prior to the Agreement Date has sponsored, maintained or
contributed to, and no Arion Benefit Plan is or was, a multiemployer plan
within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA or a defined benefit plan within
the meaning of Section 3(35) of ERISA that, in each case, could reasonably be
expected to result in the imposition of any Liability to Arion or any of its
Affiliates. None of Arion, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has incurred any unsatisfied Liability (including withdrawal
Liability) under, and no circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected
to result in any Liability to Arion, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
ERISA Affiliates under, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA that could become a Liability on Arion or any of its
Affiliates, including as a consequence of at any time being considered a
single employer under Section 414 of the Code with any other Person.

(d) Neither Arion nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Liability to provide or
has any Liability with respect to an obligation to provide, medical, dental or
life insurance coverage or any other welfare benefits after termination of
employment in respect of any Arion Employees, except as may be required under
foreign Law, Section 4980 of the Code for which the recipient pays the full
cost of coverage.

(e) Each Arion Benefit Plan that constitutes a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been
operated and maintained, in form and operation, in accordance in all material
respects with Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance of the
Department of Treasury and Revenue Services; no amount with respect to any
Arion Employee under any such Arion Benefit Plan is or has been subject to the
interest and additional tax set forth under Section 409A(1)(B) of the Code;
and none of Arion or any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to any Arion
Employee to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any Arion Employee with
respect to any Tax, including under Sections 409A or 4999 of the Code.

Section 5.14 Real Property.

(a) Schedule 5.14(a) of the Arion Disclosure Letter sets forth a list, as of
the Agreement Date, of the real property owned or leased by Arion or any of
its Subsidiaries (the "Arion Business Real Property"). Each of Arion and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, has good and valid leasehold interests in or
good, marketable, indefeasible fee simple title to, as applicable, all its
Arion Business



Real Property (in each case, other than those assets and interests disposed of
since the Agreement Date in the ordinary course of business and in accordance
with this Agreement) free and clear of any Liens other than Arion Permitted
Liens. All leases, subleases or other similar Contracts in respect of an Arion
Business Real Property are in full force and effect, constitute legal, valid
and binding obligations of Arion or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and to
the knowledge of Arion, the other parties thereto, and such Contracts are
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject, as to
enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally, and general equitable principles, except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Arion
Material Adverse Effect. There exists no breach, default or event of default
(or occurrence or event that with notice or lapse of time or both would result
in a breach, default or event of default) under any lease, sublease or other
similar Contract in respect of an Arion Business Real Property by Arion or any
of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Arion as of the Agreement Date,
any other party thereto, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Arion Business.

(b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Arion Business, none of Arion or any of its
Subsidiaries has within the three years prior to the Agreement Date given to
or received from any other Person any written notice (i) regarding any actual,
alleged, possible, or potential breach of, or default under, any lease
agreement in respect of any Arion Business Real Property or (ii) announcing or
threatening termination or cancellation of any lease agreement in respect of
any Arion Business Real Property.

(c) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.14(c) of the Arion Disclosure Letter or
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
material to the Arion Business, as of the Agreement Date (i) there are no
condemnation or eminent domain proceedings or compulsory purchase pending or,
to the knowledge of Arion, threatened that would interfere with the present
use of the Arion Business Real Property, and (ii) none of Arion or any of its
Subsidiaries has leased, subleased or licensed to any Person any Arion
Business Real Property to any Person.

Section 5.15 Absence of Certain Developments. Except for actions taken to
effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other
Transaction Documents, from March 31, 2017 through the Agreement Date, (a)
there has not been any Effect that, individually or in the aggregate, has had
or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an
Arion Material Adverse Effect, (b) the Arion Business has been conducted in
the ordinary course consistent with past practice in all material respects and
(c) none of Arion or any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action that would,
if taken by Arion or any of its Subsidiaries from the Agreement Date through
the Closing Date, require the consent of Sphinx under Section 6.2(a).

Section 5.16 Finders; Brokers. None of Arion or any of its Affiliates has
employed any finder or broker in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement who would have a claim for a fee or commission from Sphinx,
and no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage,
finders or other fee or commission from Sphinx in connection with the
negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents or the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby based on arrangements made by or on behalf of
Arion or any of its Affiliates.

Section 5.17 Solvency. Assuming that the representations and warranties in
Article 4 are true and correct, that Sphinx has complied with its respective
obligations under this Agreement, the funding of the Debt Financing has been
consummated in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Debt Financing



Commitment on the Closing Date and that the most recent financial forecasts
made available to Arion by Sphinx prior to the Agreement Date have been
prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue to be
reasonable and immediately prior to the Closing (provided that Sphinx is
making no representation and warranty with respect to such financial
forecasts), at and immediately after the Closing, and after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated hereunder (including any financings being
entered into in connection therewith), Arion and its Subsidiaries (including
the Purchased Entities), taken as a whole, on a consolidated basis, will be
Solvent.

Section 5.18 Limited Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, each of the Guarantors has delivered to Sphinx the Limited
Guarantee in the forms attached hereto as Exhibit G. The Limited Guarantees
are in full force and effect and are valid, legal, binding and enforceable
obligations of each such Guarantor, enforceable against it in accordance with
its terms except as enforceability may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, and general equitable
principles. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of any Guarantor
under the Limited Guarantee. Nothing in this Section 5.18 shall be construed
to limit in any way Sphinx's right to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by Section 11.7.

Section 5.19 Securities Act. Arion and the Other Arion Entities are acquiring
the Purchased Shares solely for the purpose of investment and not with a view
to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof. Arion
acknowledges that the Purchased Shares are not registered under the Securities
Act, any applicable state securities Laws or any applicable foreign securities
Laws, and that such Purchased Shares may not be transferred or sold except
pursuant to the registration provisions of the Securities Act or applicable
foreign securities Laws or pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom and
pursuant to applicable state securities Laws. Arion (either alone or together
with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in the Purchased Shares and is capable of bearing the economic
risks of such investment.

Section 5.20 Affiliate Transactions. Except with respect to employee or
director compensation (including incentive equity compensation) and benefits
and as otherwise set forth on Schedule 5.20 of the Arion Disclosure Letter,
none of Arion or any of its Subsidiaries, and no present or former director,
officer, employee or Affiliate of Arion or any of its Subsidiaries, directly
or indirectly, is or will be after the Effective Time, a party to any material
transaction, contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding with, or
binding upon, the Arion Business or has any material interest in any material
property or assets owned or used by the Arion Business.

Section 5.21 Independent Investigation. Arion has conducted its own
independent investigation, review and analysis of the business, operations,
assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition, software,
technology and prospects of the Business, which investigation, review and
analysis was done by Arion and its Affiliates and representatives. Except for
the representations and warranties contained in Article 4 (subject to the
disclosures in the Sphinx Disclosure Letter) and in the Transaction Documents,
Arion acknowledges and agrees that (a) in entering into this Agreement, it has
relied solely upon the aforementioned investigation, review and analysis and
not on any factual representations or opinions of Sphinx or its
representatives and (b) none of Sphinx, any Other Sphinx Entity, or any
Subsidiaries or Affiliates of Sphinx nor any other Person makes any other
express, implied or statutory representation or warranty with respect to the
Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or otherwise,
including any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, title, enforceability or noninfringement or any projections,
estimates and budgets for the Business. Arion acknowledges that there are
assumptions



inherent in making any such projections, estimates and budgets, Arion is
familiar with such uncertainties and that Arion is responsible for making its
own evaluation of the Business and shall have no claim against Sphinx with
respect thereto. Except for the indemnification obligations of Sphinx set
forth in Article 9 hereof, neither Sphinx (including all officers and
employees of Sphinx) nor any Affiliate of Sphinx (including all officers and
employees of such Affiliate) will have or be subject to any Liability or
indemnification obligation to Arion or any other Person for any information
provided to Arion or its representatives relating to the Business, the
Purchased Shares, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or otherwise
in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any information, document, or material made available to Arion or its counsel
or other representatives in Arion's due diligence review, including in "data
rooms" (electronic or otherwise) or management presentations.

Section 6.3 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a) Until the Closing, Sphinx shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
permit Arion and its authorized agents or Representatives to have reasonable
access to the properties, books, records, Contracts and such financial
(including working papers) and operating data of the Business, the Purchased
Shares, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities and the Business
Employees and other members of management of Sphinx knowledgeable about the
Business, the Purchased Shares, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities as Arion may reasonably request, during regular business hours to
review information and documentation and ask questions relative to the
properties, books, Contracts and other records of the Business, the Purchased
Shares, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities and to conduct any
other reasonable investigations; provided that such investigation (x) shall
only be upon reasonable notice and shall not unreasonably disrupt the
personnel and operations of Sphinx or any of its Subsidiaries and (y) shall
comply with the reasonable security, data privacy and data protection and
insurance requirements of Sphinx and its Subsidiaries.



All requests for access to the offices, properties, books and records of
Sphinx and its Subsidiaries shall be made to such Representatives of Sphinx as
Sphinx shall designate, who shall be solely responsible for coordinating all
such requests and all access permitted hereunder. It is further agreed that
neither Arion nor any of its Affiliates, agents or Representatives acting on
its behalf shall contact any of the employees (other than the individuals set
forth on Schedule 6.3 of the Sphinx Disclosure Letter), customers, suppliers
or partners of Sphinx or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether in person or by telephone,
electronic or other mail or other means of communication, without the specific
prior authorization of such Representatives of Sphinx (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt,
the foregoing shall not limit or restrict Arion, its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates from communicating with any such Person in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Sphinx nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to (i) provide access to
or disclose information where such access or disclosure would reasonably be
expected to cause the waiver of any attorney-client privilege of Sphinx or
such Subsidiaries or contravene any Law or binding agreement of Sphinx or such
Subsidiaries (provided that Sphinx shall inform Arion as to the general nature
of what is being withheld as a result of the foregoing and shall use its
reasonable efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive
such privilege or contravene any applicable Law or binding agreement), (ii)
provide access to or disclose any document, communication or information
related to the sale process with respect to the Business or any other
potential transaction relating to the sale or divestiture of the Business,
other than as provided in Section 6.20, (iii) provide access to personnel
records of the Business Employees, including records relating to individual
performance or evaluation records medical histories or other information that
Sphinx believes in good faith is sensitive information relating to personnel
or the disclosure of which would reasonably be expected to subject Sphinx or
any of its Subsidiaries to risk of liability (provided that Sphinx shall
inform Arion as to the general nature of what is being withheld as a result of
the foregoing and shall use its reasonable efforts to disclose such
information in a way that would not result in the sharing of sensitive
information or reasonably risk liability) or (iv) provide access to any
property of Sphinx or its Subsidiaries for purposes of conducting any invasive
subsurface environmental sampling or testing without prior written consent
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(b) The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents and their respective terms and all information,
whether written or oral, furnished by either Party to the other Party or any
Affiliate of such other Party, in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or pursuant to this Section 6.3
shall be treated as "Confidential Information" of such Party under that
certain Confidentiality Agreement dated September 15, 2016 between the Parties
(as amended or modified from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement").

(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, Sphinx shall hold and shall cause its Subsidiaries to
hold, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives
to hold, in strict confidence and not to disclose, release or use (except as
may be necessary to enforce its rights as described in clause (iii) below, in
connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the
preparation of any Tax Returns required to be filed by it or as set forth in
clause (A) of the final proviso of clause (xi) of Appendix A) without the
prior written consent of Arion, any and all Confidential Information related
to Arion, the Purchased Assets, the Purchased Shares, the Assumed Liabilities
and/or the Business; provided that Sphinx may disclose, or may permit
disclosure of, such information (i) to its Representatives who have a need to
know such information for a purpose not prohibited by this Section 6.3(c) and



are informed of their obligation to hold such information confidential to the
same extent as is applicable to Sphinx and in respect of whose failure to
comply with such obligations Sphinx will be responsible, (ii) if Sphinx, its
Subsidiaries or its Representatives are required to disclose any such
information pursuant to applicable Law or pursuant to the applicable rules and
regulations of any national securities exchange applicable to listed companies
or (iii) in connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to
this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the foregoing, in the event that any demand or request for disclosure of such
confidential and proprietary information is made pursuant to clause (ii)
above, Sphinx shall to the extent practicable and permissible promptly notify
Arion of the existence of such request or demand and shall provide Arion a
reasonable opportunity to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy
(and cooperate with Arion with respect thereto, at Arion's sole cost and
expense), and in the event such protective order or other remedy is not
obtained, Sphinx may disclose such confidential and proprietary information
without Liability hereunder, but shall furnish only that portion of such
confidential and proprietary information that Sphinx is advised by legal
counsel it is legally required to disclose and shall, to the extent requested
by Arion, exercise reasonable efforts, at Arion's sole cost and expense, to
preserve the confidentiality of such information. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, this Section 6.3(c) shall not apply to information to the
extent relating to the Excluded Assets, Excluded Liabilities or Sphinx's or
its Subsidiaries' businesses other than the Business.

(d) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, Arion shall hold and shall cause its Subsidiaries to
hold, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives
to hold, in strict confidence and not to disclose, release or use (except as
may be necessary to enforce its rights as described in clause (iii) below, in
connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement or
preparation of any Tax Returns required to be filed by it) without the prior
written consent of Sphinx, any and all Confidential Information related to the
Excluded Assets, the Excluded Liabilities and/or the businesses of Sphinx
(other than the Business); provided, that Arion may disclose, or may permit
disclosure of, such information (i) to its Representatives who have a need to
know such information for a purpose not prohibited by this Section 6.3(d) and
are informed of their obligation to hold such information confidential to the
same extent as is applicable to Arion and in respect of whose failure to
comply with such obligations Arion will be responsible, (ii) if Arion, its
Affiliates or its Representatives are required to disclose any such
information pursuant to applicable Law or pursuant to the applicable rules and
regulations of any national securities exchange applicable to listed companies
or (iii) in connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to
this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the foregoing, in the event that any demand or request for disclosure of such
confidential and proprietary information is made pursuant to clause (ii)
above, Arion shall to the extent practicable and permissible promptly notify
Sphinx of the existence of such request or demand and shall provide Sphinx a
reasonable opportunity to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy
(and cooperate with Sphinx with respect thereto, at Sphinx's sole cost and
expense), and in the event such protective order or other remedy is not
obtained, Arion may disclose such confidential and proprietary information
without Liability hereunder, but shall furnish only that portion of such
confidential and proprietary information that Arion is advised by legal
counsel it is legally required to disclose and shall, to the extent requested
by Sphinx, exercise reasonable efforts, at Sphinx's sole cost and expense, to
preserve the confidentiality of such information. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, this Section 6.3(d) shall not apply to information to the
extent relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets, Purchased Shares,
Purchased Entities, Purchased Minority Interests or the Assumed Liabilities.



Section 6.4 Necessary Efforts; No Inconsistent Action.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to applicable
Law, Sphinx and Arion agree, and Arion and Sphinx agree to cause their
respective Subsidiaries, to use their respective reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to use their respective reasonable
best efforts to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and to use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to each Party's obligation to
close the transactions contemplated hereby as set forth in Article 7 to be
satisfied as promptly as practicable, including using their respective
reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary (i) to obtain all
Consents, licenses, certificates, permits, approvals, clearances, expirations,
consents, waivers or terminations of applicable waiting periods,
authorizations, qualifications and orders of any Governmental Authority (each
a "Governmental Consent") or other Persons, including with respect to any
Assigned Contracts, required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, except, in the case of a Consent of a Person other than a
Governmental Authority, as requested by Arion (it being understood that the
failure to obtain any such Consents contemplated by this Section 6.4(a) shall
not, by itself, cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(b) or Section
7.3(b) to be deemed not to be satisfied), (ii) to cause the Investors to use
reasonable best efforts to effect all such necessary registrations and filings
with the Governmental Authorities in order to consummate and make effective
the Purchase Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
(iii) to comply with all requirements under applicable Law which may be
imposed on it with respect to this Agreement and the Purchase Transactions and
(iv) to defend any Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, brought
under, pursuant to or relating to any regulatory Law challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Parties shall cooperate fully with each other to the extent
necessary in connection with the foregoing; provided that, except as otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither Arion nor Sphinx will be
required to make any payments (other than filing fees), incur any Liability,
or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third
party in connection with obtaining any Consent of any Person.

(b) In connection with the efforts referenced in Section 6.4(a) and without
limiting the generality of the undertaking pursuant thereto, Arion and Sphinx
shall (and, in the case of Arion, shall cause the Investors or other Person(s)
controlling Arion to) promptly make all filings which may be required for the
satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) by each of them in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which, in any event, shall be made within (i) 15 Business Days following the
Agreement Date with respect to the initial filings required under the HSR Act
and (ii) 15 Business Days following the Agreement Date with respect to the
initial filings required by all other applicable Antitrust Laws or such
filings and notifications as may be required under the FATA. In addition,
Arion and Sphinx agree, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries,
to cooperate and to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take all
actions necessary to obtain any Governmental Consents required for the Closing
as contemplated by Section 6.4(a) above as promptly as possible, including
causing the Investors to use reasonable best efforts to make all other
necessary filings, notifications or registrations to obtain all such
Governmental Consents within the time periods specified in the preceding
sentence, to respond as promptly as practicable to any requests for
information from any such Governmental Authority, and to contest and resist
any action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) (an
"Antitrust Order") that restricts, prevents



or prohibits the consummation of the Purchase Transactions or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. Each Party
shall furnish to the other, and Arion shall cause the Investors to furnish,
such necessary information and assistance as the other Party may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation of any necessary filings or
submissions by it to any such Governmental Authority. Neither Party shall
consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or withdraw its
notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act or any other filing made
pursuant to any Antitrust Law or other regulatory Law with respect to the
Purchase Transactions or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement
unless the other Party has given its prior written consent to such extension
or delay (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(c) Arion and Sphinx will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider
in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the
other in advance (to the extent legally permissible), any analyses,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any Party hereto in connection with Proceedings
under or relating to any Antitrust Laws. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction Documents
and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the Parties agree, except
as prohibited or restricted by applicable Law, to (i) give each other
reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any Governmental Authority
relating to any Antitrust Laws, (ii) give each other an opportunity to
participate in each of such meetings, (iii) give each other reasonable advance
notice of all substantive oral communications with any Governmental Authority
relating to any Antitrust Laws, (iv) if any Governmental Authority initiates a
substantive oral communication regarding any Antitrust Laws, promptly notify
the other Party of the substance of such communication, (v) provide each other
with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon all written
communications (including any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals) with a Governmental Authority regarding any
Antitrust Laws and (vi) provide each other with copies of all written
communications from any Governmental Authority relating to any Antitrust Laws.
Any disclosures or provision of copies by one Party to the other may be made
on an outside counsel basis, if appropriate. Except as prohibited or
restricted by applicable Law, each Party or its attorneys shall provide the
other Party or its attorneys the opportunity to make copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications (or memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between such Party or its representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Authority, on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby.

(d) Except as prohibited or restricted by applicable Law, each of Arion and
Sphinx shall notify and keep the other reasonably advised as to (i) any
material communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) any litigation or administrative
Proceeding pending and known to such Party, or to its knowledge threatened,
which challenges, or would challenge, the transactions contemplated hereby and
subject to the provisions of Article 10 hereof, Sphinx and Arion shall not
take any action inconsistent with their obligations under this Agreement or,
without prejudice to Sphinx's or Arion's rights under this Agreement, that
would reasonably be expected to materially hinder or delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document.

(e) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted or
threatened by any Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any
of the transactions contemplated hereby as violating any Antitrust Law, then
each of the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve such
objections or challenges



as such Governmental Authority or private party may have to such transactions
so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon as practicable and in any event prior to the Outside Date.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Arion shall promptly pursue
all actions necessary to eliminate any concerns on the part of, or to satisfy
any conditions imposed by, any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over
the enforcement of any Antitrust Law, regarding the Purchase Transactions,
including (i) proposing, negotiating, offering to commit and effecting (and if
such offer is accepted, committing to and effecting), by consent decree, proxy
arrangement, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of Arion or its Subsidiaries, now
owned or hereafter sought to be acquired, or of the Purchased Shares or the
Purchased Assets, (ii) terminating or amending any existing relationships and
contractual rights and obligations or (iii) otherwise offering to take or
offering to commit to take any action which it is capable of taking, and if
the offer is accepted, taking or committing to take, such actions as are
necessary, whether or not such actions limit or modify Arion's rights of
ownership in, or ability to conduct the business of, one or more of its
operations, divisions, businesses, product lines, customers or assets,
including, after the Closing, the Business, in each case, if such action is
necessary in order to (1) obtain all Governmental Consents necessary to
satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(a) and Section 7.1(b) as
promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the Outside Date, (2) using
reasonable best efforts to avoid the initiation of any Proceeding by any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and/or (3) avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Antitrust
Order which would have the effect of preventing or delaying the consummation
of the Purchase Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby
from occurring as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the
Outside Date; provided that, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
initiation of a Proceeding described in clause (2) above or the entry of an
Antitrust Order described in clause (3) above shall not, in and of themselves,
constitute a breach by Arion of this Section 6.4(e) so long as such reasonable
best efforts are employed and the required actions set forth in this section
are offered, committed and taken. In connection therewith, Arion shall take
any and all actions necessary in order to ensure that (x) no requirement for a
waiver, consent or approval of the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice, any State Attorney General or other
Governmental Authority, (y) no decree, judgment, injunction, temporary
restraining order or any other order in any suit or Proceeding and (z) no
other matter relating to any Antitrust Law, would preclude consummation of the
Purchase Transactions prior to the Outside Date. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Arion shall keep the other party reasonably informed of all
matters, discussions and activities relating to any of the matters
contemplated by this Section 6.4(e). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in the foregoing, in no event shall (A) Sphinx or any of its Subsidiaries be
required or expected to take any action to retain any of the Purchased Assets
or Purchased Shares (including assets that would be Purchased Assets or shares
that would be Purchased Shares but for the inability to obtain a Governmental
Consent), effect the sale, divestiture or disposition of Excluded Assets or be
required to grant rights of any kind to any third party or, except as
otherwise provided in the proviso of the last sentence of Section 10.3(a), pay
any amount, grant any guarantee or provide any other consideration to any
third party or incur additional costs or expenses in order to obtain any such
Governmental Consent or (B) Arion or its Subsidiaries be required to or
expected to take any of the actions set forth in this Section 6.4(e) if such
action would have a material adverse effect in the aggregate on the Arion
Combined Business (after giving effect to the Purchase Transactions).

(f) During the period from the Agreement Date until the earlier of (x) the
date this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and subject to
the provisions of Article 10 hereof and (y) the Closing, except as otherwise
expressly permitted or contemplated by this Agreement, Arion shall not,
without the prior written consent of Sphinx, acquire (whether via merger,



consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise), or agree to so acquire,
any assets of or any equity in any other Person or any business or division
thereof, if that acquisition or agreement would reasonably be expected to (i)
materially increase the risk of not obtaining any Governmental Consent
necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(a) and Section
7.1(b), (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Authority
entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or materially increase the risk of not being
able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise, in connection with the
Purchase Transactions or (iii) prevent or materially delay receipt of any
Governmental Consent necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section
7.1(a) and Section 7.1(b).

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require
Sphinx, Arion or their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries to take or agree
to take any action with respect to their respective businesses, assets or
operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned
upon the occurrence of the Closing. This Section 6.4(g) (and not any other
provisions) provides the parties' sole and exclusive obligations with respect
to the subject matter hereof (i.e., compliance with or filings made pursuant
to any Antitrust Laws).

Section 6.5 Public Disclosures. Upon the execution of this Agreement and upon
the Closing, Arion or Sphinx shall release a joint press release mutually
acceptable to Arion and Sphinx. From and after the Agreement Date until the
Closing or earlier termination of this Agreement, neither Arion nor Sphinx
shall, and Arion and Sphinx shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries
and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, issue any press release or
other public statement relating to the terms of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby that discloses any additional information
regarding the same or that is otherwise inconsistent with the agreed press
release, or uses the name of the other Party or its Affiliates or refer to the
other Party or its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, in connection with the
relationship under this Agreement of the Parties and their Affiliates in any
media interview, advertisement, news release, press release or professional or
trade publication, or in any print media, whether or not in response to an
inquiry, without the prior written approval of the other Party, except that
(a) Arion or Sphinx may (x) issue such release or statement or make such other
disclosures as they may reasonably determine is necessary to comply with
applicable Law or the rules and regulations of any national securities
exchange and (y) publish blog posts and other internet-based communications
with regard to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, in the
case of Arion, the Arion Business or, in the case of Sphinx, the Business, (b)
the Parties may issue any press release or make other public announcement
(including to analysts or investors) to the extent that such release or
announcement only contains information previously publicly disclosed in
accordance with this Section 6.5 or is otherwise consistent in all material
respects with previous statements made jointly by Arion and Sphinx or with the
permission of the other Party, (c) Sphinx may disclose any information
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which it deems
appropriate in its reasonable judgment in light of its status as a publicly
owned company, including to securities analysts and institutional investors
and in press interviews; provided that, (x) in the case of any of clauses (a)
through (c), to the extent in the good faith judgment of such Party it is
reasonably practicable to do so, such Party shall provide the other Party with
a reasonable opportunity in light of the circumstances to review such Party's
intended communication (to the extent made in writing) and consider in good
faith modifications to the intended communication reasonably requested by the
other Party and (y) in the case of clause (c), Sphinx shall provide Arion with
any slides, scripts or other presentation materials prepared in contemplation
of such communication or disclosure and shall consider in good faith
modifications to such materials requested by Arion, (d) the Investors and
their respective management companies may make disclosures to its and their
current, former or prospective investors, equity holders and limited partners
to the extent such information is customarily provided to current, former or
prospective investors, equity holders or limited partners in private equity
funds (provided



the recipients of such information are subject to a non-disclosure agreement
or similar contractual obligation to maintain the confidentiality of such
information), (e) Arion and its Affiliates may make customary disclosures as
expressly contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment (including in
connection with the syndication of the Debt Financing), subject to the
confidentiality undertakings set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment (and
Arion will be responsible for breaches of the obligations under by such
recipients) (provided the recipients of such disclosed information are subject
to a non-disclosure agreement to maintain the confidentiality of such
information) and (f) Arion and its Affiliates may make customary disclosures
to the Investors. Without limiting the foregoing provisions hereof, Sphinx
shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with Arion regarding the
form and content of any public disclosure of any material developments or
matters involving the Business (including the financial condition or results
of operations), Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities or the Purchased
Entities, including earnings releases, reasonably in advance of publication or
release. No Party shall, directly or indirectly through another entity, make
any public statement that is intended to, or could reasonably be expected to,
disparage the other Party, their Affiliates, Subsidiaries, equityholders,
directors, managers, officers, employees, the Business or the Arion Business.

(a) Exchange of Information. Subject to the further requirements set forth in
Section 6.9(e)(iv) with respect to Taxes, after the Closing, for a period of
seven years after the Closing Date, upon receipt of reasonable prior notice,
each Party agrees to provide, or cause to be provided, to each other, as soon
as reasonably practicable after written request therefor and at the requesting
Party's sole expense, reasonable access during normal business hours to, and
in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of such other
Party's business, the other Party's employees (without substantial disruption
of employment) and to any books, records, documents, instruments, accounts,
correspondence, writings, evidences of title and other papers relating to the
conduct of the Business on or before the Closing Date and (x) in the case of
Sphinx, the Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities and (y) in the case of
Arion, the Purchased Assets, the Purchased Shares and the Assumed Liabilities
(the "Books and Records"), to the extent reasonably available and in the
possession or under the control of the other Party that the requesting Party
reasonably needs (i) to comply with reporting, disclosure, filing or other
requirements imposed on the requesting Party (including under applicable
securities Laws) by a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the
requesting Party, (ii) for use in any other judicial, regulatory,
administrative or other Proceeding, or in order to satisfy Tax, audit,
accounting, claims, regulatory, litigation or other similar requirements,

amended return or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a
right to a refund of Taxes or any Tax audit or other Proceeding in respect of
Taxes, (iv) to comply with its obligations under this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents or (v) in connection with any other matter requiring
access to any such employees, books, records, documents, files and

operation of the Business after Closing or Sphinx's operation of its
businesses (other than the Business) after Closing, as the case may be;
provided, however, that no Party shall be required to provide access to or
disclose information where such access or disclosure would reasonably be
expected to violate any Law or agreement, or waive any attorney-client or
other similar privilege (provided, in the event such provision of information
would reasonably be expected to violate any Law or agreement or waive any
attorney-client or other similar privilege, the Party with such information
shall inform the other as to the general nature of what is being withheld as a
result of the foregoing and shall take all reasonable measures to permit the
disclosure in a manner that avoids any such violation or waiver, including in
accordance with Section 6.13), and each Party



may redact information regarding itself or its Subsidiaries not relating to
Business, the Purchased Assets, the Purchased Shares and the Assumed
Liabilities.

(b) Ownership of Information. Any information owned by a Party that is
provided to a requesting Party pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be deemed to
remain the property of the providing Party. Unless specifically set forth
herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or
conferring rights of license or otherwise in any such information.

(c) Record Retention. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Party agrees
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to retain the Books and Records in
its possession or control for a reasonable period of time as set forth in its
regular document retention policy, as such policy may be amended from time to
time, or for such longer period as may be required by Law, or until the
expiration of the relevant representation or warranty under any of the
Transaction Documents and any related claim of indemnification related
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party may destroy or otherwise
dispose of any Books and Records not in accordance with its retention policy;
provided that prior to such destruction or disposal (i) such Party shall
provide no less than 75 Business Days' prior written notice to the other Party
of any such proposed destruction or disposal (which notice shall specify in
reasonable detail which of the Books and Records is proposed to be so
destroyed or disposed of) and (ii) if a recipient of such notice shall request
in writing prior to the scheduled date for such destruction or disposal that
any of the information proposed to be destroyed or disposed of be delivered to
such recipient, such Party proposing the destruction or disposal shall, as
promptly as practicable, arrange for the delivery of such of the Books and
Records as was requested by the recipient (it being understood that all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs associated with the delivery of the requested
Books and Records shall be paid by such recipient).

(d) Limitation of Liability. No Party shall have any Liability to any other
Party in the event that any information exchanged or provided pursuant to this
Section 6.6 is found to be inaccurate. No Party shall have any Liability to
any other Party if any information is destroyed or lost after commercially
reasonable efforts by such Party to comply with the provisions of Section
6.6(c).

(e) Confidential Information. Nothing in this Section 6.6 shall require (i)
either Party to violate any agreement with any third parties regarding the
confidentiality of confidential and proprietary information; provided that in
the event that either Party is required under this Section 6.6 to disclose any
such information, that Party shall inform the other as to the general nature
of what is being withheld as a result of the foregoing and shall use all
reasonable efforts to seek to obtain such third party's Consent to the
disclosure of such information and implement requisite procedures to enable
the disclosure of such information or take all reasonable measures to permit
the disclosure in a manner that avoids any such violation, (ii) Sphinx to
provide or cause to be provided to Arion any information related to the sale
process of the Business or any other potential transaction relating to the
sale, spin-off or divestiture of the Business or Sphinx's or its
representatives' evaluation thereof, including projections, financial or other
information related thereto, except as otherwise required by Section 6.21 or
(iii) either Party to disclose any information if Sphinx or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Arion or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation (including any such litigation
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby), to the extent the information is related thereto (or the subject
matter thereof) or requested in connection therewith (provided that such
restriction shall not apply to any information to the extent necessary for
such Party to prepare any Tax Returns or any filings required by the rules and
regulations of any national securities exchange). The covenants



contained herein shall in no event be considered a waiver of any attorney-
client privilege, work product privilege or any similar privilege.

Section 6.7 Employee Relations and Benefits.

(a) Schedule 6.7(a) of the Sphinx Disclosure Letter identifies each Business
Employee (i) located within the United States by name, job title, annual
salary or hourly wage rate; department; status as active or inactive; and
jurisdiction of employment; and (ii) located outside of the United States, on
a redacted basis to eliminate names, but including identification numbers;
annual salary or hourly wage rate; department; status as active or inactive;
and jurisdiction of employment; provided, however, that Sphinx shall update
Schedule 6.7(a) of the Sphinx Disclosure Letter from time to time until the
Closing Date in order to maintain, on a reasonable frequency of update, the
accuracy of Schedule 6.7(a) of the Sphinx Disclosure Letter, including as a
result of employee terminations, transfers (within Sphinx or its
Subsidiaries), new hires and accidental or inadvertent errors or omissions, in
each case, to the extent permitted by Section 6.1(a)(y); provided, further,
that Sphinx shall provide an unredacted Schedule 6.7(a) of the Sphinx
Disclosure Letter as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement and in accordance with applicable Law. Following the Agreement Date
but prior to the Closing, if Arion identifies any employees of Sphinx or its
Subsidiaries that (i) Arion can demonstrate are or have been primarily
dedicated to the Business (at any time since April 1, 2017) and (ii) the
services such employee provides are reasonably necessary (and not duplicated
by a Business Employee already identified on Schedule 6.7(a) of the Sphinx
Disclosure Letter as determined by Arion in its reasonable discretion) to
operate the Business following the Closing in the reasonably same manner as
the Business was operated prior to the Closing, then Schedule 6.7(a) of the
Sphinx Disclosure Letter shall be updated to include such employee with the
consent of Sphinx, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed (an employee so included in Schedule 6.7(a) of the Sphinx
Disclosure Letter, an "Omitted Employee").

(b) Not later than the date that is (i) in the case of Business Employees in
the United States, the 45th calendar day following the Agreement Date; (ii) in
the case of Business Employees located in a jurisdiction outside of the United
States (other than Automatic Transferred Employees), the date which is the
later of (x) the 45th calendar day following the Agreement Date and (y) the
30th calendar day following Sphinx's delivery to Arion of the unredacted
Schedule 6.7(a) of the Sphinx Disclosure Letter, as required by Section 6.7(a)
(or such longer time as may be required by applicable Law in such
jurisdiction); and (iii) with respect to any Business Employee located in a
jurisdiction in which the applicable Employing Entity is being newly formed,
the date which is thes later of (x) the 45th calendar day following the
Agreement Date and (y) the 10th calendar day following the date on which the
Employing Entity (as defined in Section 6.7(c)) is formed or otherwise legally
able to offer employment, Arion will, or will cause one of its Affiliates to,
make an offer of employment to each of the Business Employees, other than the
Automatic Transferred Employees, Inactive Employees and the Purchased Entity
Employees, in accordance with the terms of Section 6.7(c). Each Business
Employee, other than a Purchased Entity Employee and/or Automatic Transferred
Employee, who is on or eligible for short-term or long-term disability leave
of absence immediately prior to the Closing, is referred to herein as an
"Inactive Employee." If an Inactive Employee seeks and is able to return to
active employment within six months following the Closing Date (or at such
later time as required by applicable Law) and Sphinx notifies Arion of same,
then Arion will, or will cause one of its Affiliates to, make an offer of
employment to such Inactive Employee in accordance with the terms of Section
6.7(c) effective upon the date within such six-month period that such Inactive
Employee is able to return to active employment. Each such Business



Employee who accepts and actually commences employment with Arion or any of
its Affiliates effective immediately following the Closing, each Automatic
Transferred Employee and each Purchased Entity Employee, is referred to herein
as a "Continuing Employee." Each Continuing Employee who is based in the
United States is referred to as a "U.S. Continuing Employee," and each
Continuing Employee who is based outside of the United States is referred to
as a "Foreign Continuing Employee." Each Business Employee that receives an
offer of employment from Arion or its Affiliates (or a Purchased Entity, as
directed by Arion or the Transaction Committee) that complies with this
Section 6.7 (a "Compliant Offer"), excluding (i) each Automatic Transferred
Employee and (ii) each Purchased Entity Employee, is referred to herein as an
"Offer Recipient Employee." Nothing herein will be construed as a
representation or guarantee by Sphinx or any of its Subsidiaries that (A) some
or all of the Business Employees will accept an offer of employment with Arion
or one of its Affiliates or acquiesce to the automatic transfer of their
employment by operation of Law to Arion or any of its Affiliates, as
applicable, or (B) some or all of the Continuing Employees will continue in
employment with Arion or any of its Affiliates for any period of time
following the Closing.

(c) Subject to applicable Law, Arion and Sphinx will reasonably cooperate with
each other in connection with the presentation by Arion of employment offers
to the Offer Recipient Employees. Pursuant to this Section 6.7, Arion will, or
will cause one of its Affiliates (any such Affiliate, the "Employing Entity")
to, present its terms and conditions of employment (including terms and
conditions in respect of post-Closing compensation and benefits and
Transaction Severance Benefits) to the Offer Recipient Employees no later than
(i) in the case of Business Employees in the United States, the 45th calendar
day following the Agreement Date; (ii) in the case of Business Employees
located in a jurisdiction outside of the United States (other than Automatic
Transferred Employees), the date which is the later of (x) the 45th calendar
day following the Agreement Date and (y) the 30th calendar day following
Sphinx's delivery to Arion of the un-redacted Schedule 6.7(a) of the Sphinx
Disclosure Letter, as required by Section 6.7(a) (or such longer time as may
be required by applicable Law in such jurisdiction); and (iii) with respect to
any Business Employee located in a jurisdiction in which the applicable
Employing Entity is being newly formed, the date which is the later of (x) the
45th calendar day following the Agreement Date and (y) the 10th calendar day
following the date on which the Employing Entity (as defined in Section
6.7(c)) is formed or otherwise legally able to offer employment, which terms
and conditions will be consistent with the provisions of this Section 6.7.
Arion will provide Sphinx with a reasonable opportunity to review and provide
input on the communications, proposed terms and conditions for all Business
Employees reasonably in advance and will not present any particular set of
terms and conditions to any Business Employees without Sphinx's prior written
consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Arion will, or will cause the Employing Entity to, provide to each
Offer Recipient Employee a written offer of employment upon the employment
terms described herein, with such offer to be effective on the Closing Date
or, with respect to an Inactive Employee, the date described in Section 6.7(a)
above. Except to the extent agreed to between the Employing Entity and any
Continuing Employees (including related to a change of the location of
employment for those Continuing Employees included on Schedule 6.7(c)(i) of
the Sphinx Disclosure Letter, which schedule will be delivered by Arion to
Sphinx within 10 Business Days after the delivery by Sphinx of an un-redacted
Schedule 6.7(a) of the Sphinx Disclosure Letter; provided, that such
Continuing Employees shall not be required to agree to such change of location
and if such Continuing Employee declines such change of location, he or she
will not be deemed to have received a "Compliant Offer"), the employment offer
by Arion and/or the Employing Entity of each such Continuing Employee shall be
at the same general location in accordance with applicable Law at which such
Continuing Employee was employed immediately prior to the Closing Date, and



shall provide that (A) such Continuing Employee will initially either be paid
the same cash compensation (consisting of base salary or hourly wage rate and
target cash bonus or commissions, but excluding nonqualified deferred
compensation and equity-based benefits) and employment benefits that in the
aggregate are substantially comparable as the base salary or hourly wage,
other cash compensation and such employment benefits that were provided to (i)
such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing under the existing
terms of the Sphinx Benefit Plans listed on Schedule 4.12(a) of the Sphinx
Disclosure Letter or (ii) a similarly situated employee of Arion, whether
previously a Business Employee or an Arion Employee immediately prior to the
Closing, or as required by any Contract as set forth on Schedule 4.12(a) of
the Sphinx Disclosure Letter or any applicable Transfer Regulations
(including, in each such case, more favorable terms to the employee as are
required by local Laws including any applicable Transfer Regulations, in which
case the terms of such offer of employment or continued employment shall
comply with such local Laws) (such compensation and benefits, the "Similar
Benefits") and (B) be granted equity compensation under the Arion Incentive
Plan or be provided a long term incentive compensation opportunity, in each
case having an equivalent value (as reasonably determined by Arion) as the
value (as reasonably determined by Arion) of the unvested portion of the
Sphinx restricted stock units held by such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Closing Date and that are cancelled as of the Closing for no
consideration and are listed in Schedule 6.7(c)(ii) of the Sphinx Disclosure
Letter (which schedule shall include the number of such restricted stock units
and the original vesting schedule that would continue to apply to such
restricted stock units in the absence of the Closing). For the avoidance of
doubt, all liabilities pursuant to the Sphinx restricted stock units shall
remain Excluded Employee Liabilities. Arion and/or the Employing Entity shall
maintain Similar Benefits for Continuing Employees during the 12 month period
that begins as of the Closing Date, or (x) such shorter period as such
Continuing Employee remains an employee of such Employing Entity following the
Closing Date, or (y) such longer period as required by any applicable local
Laws or Transfer Regulations (the "Continuation Period"). Between the
Agreement Date and the Closing Date, any communications between Arion and its
Affiliates and any Business Employees regarding the terms of employment,
employee benefits or otherwise regarding employment with Arion and its
Affiliates following the Closing will be conducted at the times and through
the processes mutually agreed upon by Sphinx and Arion and in accordance with
applicable Law.

(d) Upon the Closing, Arion will, or will cause the Employing Entity to, make
available and maintain a long-term incentive compensation and/or retention
program for Continuing Employees and any Arion Employees as developed and
determined by Arion (after consultation with Sphinx) to which Arion Common
Shares shall be reserved for issuance to any Continuing Employee or Arion
Employee (the "Arion Incentive Plan").

(e) Arion or the Employing Entity will credit each Continuing Employee the
amount of accrued and unpaid hours of vacation (to the extent permitted by
Law), personal hours, PTO or days earned, sick leave and any other leave
required to be credited by Law applicable to such Continuing Employee as of
the Closing, except to the extent that such credit would result in the
duplication of compensation and benefits and to the extent reflected in
Closing Net Working Capital, collectively referred to herein as such
Continuing Employee's accrued PTO, and Sphinx will provide to Arion as of the
Closing Date a schedule indicating for each Continuing Employee the type and
number of days of such accrued PTO for each Continuing Employee. During the
Continuation Period, Arion will ensure that such accrued PTO is not subject to
forfeiture to the same extent not subject to forfeiture under the policies of
Sphinx and its Subsidiaries governing such accrued PTO prior to the Closing or
applicable Law; provided that such accrued PTO may count toward any maximum



accrual amount under any plan, program or policy established by Arion or the
Employing Entity for the purpose of providing such leave.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Automatic Transferred
Employees and Purchased Entity Employees shall not be terminated upon Closing,
but rather the rights, powers, duties, liabilities and obligations of Sphinx
or any of its respective Subsidiaries to such employees in respect of the
terms of employment with such employees in force immediately before Closing
shall be transferred to Arion or one of its Affiliates to the extent required
by applicable employment Laws and Transfer Regulations and these terms of
employment shall remain applicable during the Continuation Period to the
extent required by such Laws and Transfer Regulations. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, to the extent that (i) the applicable Laws of
any jurisdiction including any applicable Transfer Regulations, (ii) any
collective bargaining agreement or other agreement with a works council or
labor organization or (iii) any employment agreement, would require Arion or
its Affiliates to provide any more favorable terms of employment to any
Foreign Continuing Employee than those otherwise provided for by this Section
6.7 (or modify the period of time for which such standards are met), in
connection with the Purchase Transactions or other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, then Arion will, or
will cause one of Arion's Affiliates to provide such Foreign Continuing
Employee with such more favorable terms, and otherwise provide terms of
employment in accordance with this Section 6.7.

(g) Sphinx will and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and Arion will and will
cause its Affiliates to, cooperate to identify and use reasonable efforts to
transfer to Arion or its Affiliates of any individuals engaged as independent
contractors by Sphinx or any of its Subsidiaries who are primarily engaged in
the conduct of the Business.

(h) Arion shall be responsible for, and shall perform and discharge, or cause
to be performed and discharged, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Sphinx
and its Subsidiaries from and against, all Liabilities that arise out of the
employment or the termination of employment by Arion or any of its Affiliates
of the Continuing Employees (including any Automatic Transferred Employees or
Purchased Entity Employees) upon and following the Closing. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, with respect to each Continuing Employee who
incurs a Qualifying Termination during the Continuation Period, Arion will, or
will cause the Employing Entity to, provide such employee with those severance
payments and termination benefits under the applicable formula set forth, or
otherwise described, in the Sphinx Severance Policies or in individual
employment agreements or arrangements as listed on Schedule 6.7(h) of the
Sphinx Disclosure Letter (the "Sphinx Severance Agreements"), or any higher
amount of severance and/or additional termination payments or benefits as may
be required by applicable Law (collectively, the "Transaction Severance
Benefits"). Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, Arion will, or
will cause the Employing Entity to, pay or deliver the Transaction Severance
Benefits to any such Continuing Employee whose employment is being terminated
in a Qualifying Termination as soon as reasonably practicable following the
termination of such Continuing Employee's employment. For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Qualifying Termination" means a termination by Arion or the
Employing Entity of the Continuing Employee's employment other than for
"Cause" (not due to death or disability) or a resignation by the Continuing
Employee of its employment that constitutes a "Constructive Termination", in
each case as set forth in the applicable individual Sphinx Severance Agreement
or the Sphinx Severance Policies. The occurrence of a Constructive Termination
shall not be deemed to occur unless any such Continuing Employee provides
written notice to Arion, or the Employing Entity, of the event that would
otherwise be considered a Constructive Termination within 30 days of its first
occurrence and Arion, or the Employing Entity, fails to cure such event



within 30 days of such written notice, and the Continuing Employee resigns
within 30 days of Arion's (or the Employing Entity's) failure to cure
(otherwise, the Continuing Employee will irrevocably waive any claim of
Constructive Termination with respect to the alleged event). The Continuing
Employees shall be notified by Arion, or the Employing Entity, of the
requirements of a Qualifying Termination.

(i) In addition, Sphinx and Arion intend that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall not constitute a separation, termination or severance of
employment of any Business Employee prior to or upon the consummation of the
Purchase Transactions and that the Business Employees will have continuous and
uninterrupted employment immediately before and immediately after the Closing
Date, and Arion shall, and shall cause the Employing Entity to, comply with
any requirements under applicable Law to ensure the same. Arion shall assume,
be responsible for, pay and discharge, reimburse Sphinx and shall indemnify
and hold harmless Sphinx and its Subsidiaries from and against all, severance
and other termination benefits as set forth, or otherwise described, in
Sphinx's severance policies as listed on Schedule 6.7(h) of the Sphinx
Disclosure Letter (the "Sphinx Severance Policies"), the Sphinx Severance
Agreements or applicable Law with respect to (i) the termination by Sphinx or
any of its Subsidiaries of any Business Employee's employment with Sphinx or
its Subsidiaries if such Business Employee did not receive a Compliant Offer
or (ii) Arion's failure to comply with Section 6.7(c), Section 6.7(d), Section
6.7(f) and Section 6.7(h) hereof following a 15-day opportunity to cure any
such failure.

(j) Excluding all of the Assumed Liabilities (which includes Transaction
Severance Benefits, as well as any accrued PTO and accrued sales commission
amounts to the extent included in the calculation of Closing Net Working
Capital and the amount that may become payable by Arion to Sphinx under
Sections 6.7(h) and (i)), Sphinx shall be responsible for and shall perform
and discharge, or cause to be performed and discharged, and shall indemnify
and hold harmless Arion and its Affiliates from and against, (i) all accrued
compensation due to any Business Employees for the period of their employment
with Sphinx or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing except to the extent
reflected in Closing Net Working Capital, (ii) the sponsorship of and all
Liabilities under or with respect to any Sphinx Benefit Plans, including those
Liabilities incurred or claimed in respect of any Business Employee or their
covered dependents for benefits or claims arising with respect to the period
on or prior to the Closing Date, (iii) any and all Liabilities arising out of,
or related to, any current or former Business Employee's period of employment
or service with Sphinx or one of its Subsidiaries incurred on or prior to the
Closing Date, (iv) all Liabilities arising out of or related to any incentive
equity program of Sphinx (including restricted stock units and performance
stock units) and (v) any and all Liabilities (including all Liabilities
relating to severance) arising out of, or relating to, any employees of the
Sphinx Parties who are not Business Employees or do not become Continuing
Employees not as the result of a failure to receive a Compliant Offer (the
"Excluded Employee Liabilities").

(k) Unless otherwise agreed between Arion and Sphinx, provided under the terms
of the Sphinx Benefit Plans, the Transition Services Agreement or required by
applicable Law, effective as of the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee
shall cease to participate in, or accrue further benefits under, any Sphinx
Benefit Plan (other than as a former employee of Sphinx and its Subsidiaries
to the extent, if any, permitted by the terms of such Sphinx Benefit Plan).
Continuing Employees shall commence participation in the Arion Benefit Plans
at or as soon as practicable after the Effective Time; provided that any delay
in commencement resulting from an act or omission by Arion or one of its
Affiliates shall not result in any gap or lack of health benefits.



(l) Where applicable, Arion shall retain responsibility for all medical,
dental, vision, life insurance, disability and other welfare plan benefits or
expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee following the Closing Date under
the applicable Arion Benefit Plan. Sphinx shall retain reasonability for all
medical, dental, vision, life insurance, disability and other welfare plan
benefits or expenses incurred by Business Employees under the Sphinx Benefit
Plans, regardless of when incurred or reported.

(m) To the extent permitted or required by applicable Law, in the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs, Arion will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each benefit plan of Arion and its Affiliates that
is a health benefit plan (collectively, "Arion Benefit Plans") to (i) waive
all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and service
conditions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable
to Continuing Employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions would not
have been applicable to the Continuing Employees under the terms of the
analogous Sphinx Benefit Plans in effect immediately prior to the Closing
Date, (ii) honor any payments, charges and expenses of such Continuing
Employees (and their eligible dependents) that were applied toward the
deductible and out-of-pocket maximums under the corresponding Sphinx Benefit
Plan in satisfying any applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums or co-
payments under a corresponding Arion Benefit Plan during the same plan year in
which such payments, charges and expenses were made and (iii) with respect to
any medical plan, waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Continuing
Employee following the Closing Date to the extent that such limitations or
requirements would not have been applicable to a Continuing Employee under the
terms of the analogous Sphinx Benefit Plan in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

(n) Arion and the Employing Entity will provide credit for each Continuing
Employee's length of service with Sphinx and its Subsidiaries (including any
length of service with any entity acquired by Sphinx or any such Subsidiary)
for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and level of severance
benefits under each Arion Benefit Plan, retirement or severance plan, program,
policy or arrangement of Arion and its Affiliates (other than any equity based
incentive programs), (other than with respect to defined benefit, nonqualified
or deferred compensation, equity or equity-based or retiree welfare benefits)
for the same purposes that such service was credited by Sphinx as of the
Closing under an analogous Sphinx Benefit Plan, except that such prior service
credit will not be required to the extent that it results in a duplication of
compensation or benefits for the same period of services. Sphinx will provide
to Arion as of the Closing Date a schedule indicating the length of service of
each Continuing Employee with Sphinx and its Subsidiaries through the Closing
Date.

(o) In addition to the liability of Arion pursuant to Section 6.7(h),
effective as of the Closing, Arion and Arion's Affiliates will be responsible
for (i) all Liabilities with respect to U.S. Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents, in respect of health insurance continuation under COBRA
with respect to qualifying events occurring after the Closing under the
applicable Arion Benefit Plan and (ii) to the extent applicable, all workers'
compensation benefits payable to or on behalf of the U.S. Continuing Employees
with respect to injuries occurring after the Effective Time (or with respect
to injuries occurring prior to or as of the Closing Date to the extent
reflected in Final Net Working Capital). Sphinx and its Subsidiaries will
assume or retain any obligations under COBRA with respect to U.S. Business
Employees and other qualified beneficiaries: (A) who are enrolled in COBRA
continuation coverage under a Sphinx Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date or
(B) with respect to whom a qualifying event occurred on or prior to the
Closing. Effective as of the Closing Date, Sphinx or its Subsidiaries shall
take all necessary actions to provide full vesting



of all amounts credited to the account of any U.S. Continuing Employee under
any Sphinx Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code (the "Sphinx 401(k) Plan"), and Sphinx or its Subsidiaries shall make the
matching, profit sharing, and any other employer contributions to such Sphinx
401(k) Plan on behalf of the U.S. Continuing Employees that would have been
made irrespective of any end-of-year service requirements otherwise applicable
to such contributions, prorated for the portion of the plan year ending on the
Closing Date. Sphinx and its Subsidiaries shall take all actions necessary or
appropriate to (A) ensure that, under the terms of any Sphinx 401(k) Plan,
each U.S. Continuing Employee is eligible to receive a distribution from the
Sphinx 401(k) Plan as a result of the Closing Date. Sphinx and its
Subsidiaries shall take all actions necessary to permit the rollover in cash
(or outstanding loan promisors notes for participant loans) of account
balances (including outstanding loans) of U.S. Continuing Employees from the
Sphinx 401(k) Plan to any 401(k) plan established by Arion or its Affiliates,
as the participants' election.

(p) Without limiting the provisions of this Section 6.7 and as identified on
Section 6.7(p) of the Sphinx Disclosure Letter, (i) with respect to the fiscal
year of Sphinx in which the Closing occurs and with respect to each Continuing
Employee entitled to receive a portion of the Accrued Bonuses and who remains
employed at the time of payment, Arion shall, or shall cause the applicable
Employing Entity of such Continuing Employee to, make annual bonus payments to
such Continuing Employee in an amount equal to at least (x) the amount of the
Accrued Bonuses attributable to such Continuing Employee (the "Attributable
Accrued Bonus Amount"), if any plus (y) such Continuing Employee's Applicable
Portion of the Forfeited Bonuses, if any, which payment shall be made at the
same time or times as Sphinx would have paid such bonuses in the ordinary
course of business prior to the Closing Date and (ii) with respect to any
Sphinx Sales and Commission Plans in effect as of the closing, Arion shall, or
shall cause the applicable Employing Entity of such Continuing Employee to,
make such payments under the Sphinx Sales and Commission Plans as they are
earned by such Continuing Employee and at least in an amount equal to the
amount of accrued sales commissions to the extent included in the calculation
of the Closing Net Working Capital, if any, which payment shall be made at the
same time or times Sphinx pays such sales and commission payments in the
ordinary course of business. As used herein, (A) "Forfeited Bonus Amount"
means the amount equal to (x) Accrued Bonuses minus (y) the aggregate of all
Attributable Accrued Bonus Amounts and (B) "Applicable Portion" means, with
respect to a Continuing Employee, a fraction, the numerator of which is such
Continuing Employee's Attributable Accrued Bonus Amount and the denominator of
which is the aggregate of all Attributable Accrued Bonus Amounts.

(q) Following the Agreement Date, each of Sphinx and its Subsidiaries and
Arion and its Affiliates will use reasonable best efforts in all matters
necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 6.7 and the
requirements of any applicable Law or Transfer Regulations and will provide,
and will cause each of their respective representatives, including legal,
human resources and regulatory compliance personnel, to provide, all
cooperation reasonably requested by the other Party in that regard, including,
(i) cooperating and providing each other with all necessary and reasonable
assistance and information to ensure that any works councils or committees,
trade unions and/or employee representatives applicable to the Foreign
Continuing Employees are provided with the information required in order for
proper consultation, notification and other required processes under
applicable Law to take place and (ii) exchanging information and data,
including reports prepared in connection with bonus plan participation and
related data of Continuing Employees (other than individual bonus
opportunities based on target bonus as a percentage of base salary), relating
to workers' compensation, employee benefits and employee benefit plan
coverages, including information and data that are necessary to support or
perform any compensation consultant process or that is otherwise reasonably
requested in connection with any compensation consultant



process (in each case, except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law or to
the extent that such information and data relates to performance ratings or
assessments of employees of Sphinx and its Subsidiaries), making any and all
required filings and notices, making any and all required communications with
Business Employees and obtaining any Governmental Consents required hereunder.
Such cooperation will include the provision of any information and
consultation required by applicable Law or Transfer Regulations (which shall
include, in the case of Arion, information required by any applicable Transfer
Regulations regarding any measures Arion envisages it will take with respect
to any Automatic Transferred Employees after Closing), the terms of any
Contract, or as reasonably requested by the other Party. Each of Sphinx and
Arion will make available its representatives at such times and in such places
as the other Party may reasonably request for purposes of discussions with
representatives of any such works council, economic committee, union or
similar body.

(r) The Parties recognize that certain of the Business Employees are in
nonimmigrant visa status or have applications for lawful permanent residence
pending with the relevant governmental authorities (the "Affected Foreign
Employees"). The Parties further recognize that new or amended petitions with
respect to such Affected Foreign Employees may be required in certain of these
cases, unless Arion (or its Affiliates, as the case may be) is deemed the
"successor-in-interest" to Sphinx or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable
(as such term is used in pronouncements by the United States Department of
Homeland Security ("DHS")) with respect to such Affected Foreign Employees.
Accordingly, Arion hereby expressly agrees to assume, and Sphinx hereby
assigns, all of the immigration-related Liabilities of the Affected Foreign
Employees (including any obligations, Liabilities and undertakings arising
from or under attestations made in each certified and still effective labor
condition application filed by Sphinx with respect to any such Affected
Foreign Employees). The Parties each agree to take such actions as may
reasonably be requested at and following the Closing to document to the DHS or
such other governmental agency, as the case may be, as may be necessary, the
"successor-in-interest" relationship with respect to any Affected Foreign
Employees.

(s) In connection with the employment by, or transition to, an Employing
Entity of any Purchased Entity Employees, the Parties acknowledge that it may
be necessary and desirable for Sphinx to, or cause its Subsidiaries to, at
Arion's sole cost and expense, perform the obligations of Arion or an
Employing Entity under this Section 6.7 in order to facilitate the Transfer of
Continuing Employees to Arion on the Closing Date and Sphinx agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to perform such obligations at Arion's reasonable and
lawful instructions to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law. It is
understood and agreed that notwithstanding the foregoing, Arion shall promptly
reimburse Sphinx for its actual, out-of-pocket costs and expenses in
connection with such performance and Arion shall remain solely responsible for
its obligations under this Section 6.7, and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Sphinx and its Subsidiaries from and against any and all Liabilities of Sphinx
or of any of its Subsidiaries arising out of any actions taken under this
Section 6.7 on behalf of, and at the instruction of, Arion; provided that
Sphinx consults reasonably in advance with Arion prior to performing any of
Arion's obligations under this Section 6.7 and performs such actions in good
faith in accordance with Arion's reasonable and lawful instructions.

(t) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the provisions
of this Section 6.7 shall not create any third-party beneficiary right, or any
right to employment or continued employment or to a particular term or
condition of employment with Arion or any of its Affiliates for any Person,
including any Business Employee or Continuing Employee. Nothing in this
Section 6.7 or any other provision of this Agreement (i) shall be construed to
establish, amend, or modify



any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii)
shall limit the ability of Arion or any of its Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them.

Section 6.8 Insurance Matters. Following the Closing, Sphinx shall provide
Arion and its Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities) access to, upon
reasonable request, information with respect to all occurrence-based third-
party insurance policies that have provided coverage to any Purchased Entity
or the Business prior to Closing. Such insurance, to the extent provided in
the applicable policies, shall be available to cover the Liabilities of the
Purchased Entities and the Business to the extent any claims are asserted that
arise out of operations of the Purchased Entities or the Business prior to
Closing, subject in each case to the terms and limitations of such policies
(the "Pre-Closing Claims"). If any Pre-Closing Claim is asserted after the
Closing, Arion or its Affiliates shall be responsible to pay all deductibles,
self-retention amounts, premium adjustments, litigation expenses or other
costs as required under the applicable insurance policies and all costs of
prosecution or collection thereof. Sphinx shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Arion and the Purchased Entities in any
of their efforts to avail themselves of coverage under any such applicable
insurance policies with respect to Pre-Closing Claims, but it shall be the
responsibility of the Purchased Entities to submit claims directly to the
applicable insurers. Arion acknowledges that certain policies and insurance
coverage maintained on behalf of the Business are part of the corporate
insurance program maintained by Sphinx and its Subsidiaries, and related to
businesses other than the Business, in which case, such coverage will not be
available with respect to any claims that are asserted or arise out of
operations of the Purchased Entities or the Business following the Closing or
otherwise Transferred to Arion. From and after the Closing Date, the Purchased
Entities and their Subsidiaries shall cease to be insured by Sphinx's or its
Subsidiaries' insurance policies or by any of their self-insured programs
except with respect to Pre-Closing Claims in accordance with this Section 6.8,
and Sphinx and any of its Subsidiaries may, to be effective at the Closing,
amend any insurance policies in the manner it deems appropriate to give effect
to this Section 6.8 with respect to coverage of the Purchased Entities or the
Business following the Closing. Neither Arion nor any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, each of the Purchased Entities) shall have any
access, right, title or interest to or in any such insurance policies
(including to all claims and rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds
other than with respect to claims made on behalf of Arion, its Affiliates or
the Business) to cover any assets of Arion or its Affiliates or any Liability
arising from the operation of the Business following the Closing. From and
after the Closing, Arion shall be responsible for securing all insurance it
considers appropriate for Arion and its Affiliates and its operation of the
Business. Arion covenants and agrees not to seek to assert or to exercise any
rights or claims of the Business or any Purchased Entity under or in respect
of any past or current insurance policy the Business or any Purchased Entity
is a named insured except with respect to Pre-Closing Claims.

Section 6.9 Tax Matters.

(a) Tax Indemnification.

(i) Sphinx shall indemnify and hold harmless the Arion Indemnified Parties
from and against: (A) except to the extent such Taxes are indemnified under
Section 6.9(a)(ii)(D), (1) Taxes of the Purchased Entities for all Pre-Closing
Tax Periods, (2) Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Purchased Assets for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period and (3) Taxes imposed on or with respect to the
Business for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (B) Taxes arising out of any breach
of any covenant made by Sphinx or any of its Subsidiaries in this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document, (C) Taxes arising from and attributable to the
Sphinx Pre-Closing Restructuring Steps (except for Transfer Taxes as provided
for in Section 6.9(b)) or any other action taken by Sphinx and its Affiliates
in order to effectuate or otherwise



incurred in connection with the restructuring transactions contemplated in
Section 2.8(a) hereof and (D) Taxes arising under Section 1.1502-6 of the
Treasury Regulations or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law
by virtue of any Purchased Entity having been a member of a consolidated,
combined, affiliated, unitary or other similar tax group prior to the Closing,
in each case excluding any (x) additional Taxes that would not have been
incurred (to the extent that exceeds the Taxes that otherwise would have been
incurred) but for (1) any breach of any covenant made by Arion or any of its
Affiliates or (2) any action taken outside the ordinary course of business by
Arion or any of its Affiliates after the Closing but on the Closing Date and
(y) any Taxes described in Section 6.9(a)(ii)(D) (relating to Requested Sphinx
Restructuring Steps) or Section 6.9(a)(ii)(E) (relating to certain Taxes
attributable to the Arion Pre-Closing Restructuring Steps) (collectively, the
"Excluded Tax Liabilities"). Notwithstanding that a claim for Taxes or Losses
may fall into multiple categories of this Section 6.9(a)(i), an Arion
Indemnified Party may recover such Taxes and Losses one time only.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement and for the avoidance of
doubt, the limitations in Section 9.2 shall not apply to this Section
6.9(a)(i).

(ii) Arion shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sphinx Indemnified Parties
from and against (A)(1) Taxes of the Purchased Entities for all Post-Closing
Tax Periods, (2) Taxes imposed on the Purchased Assets for any Post-Closing
Tax Period, (3) Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Business for any Post-
Closing Tax Period, (B) Taxes arising out of any breach of any covenant made
by Arion or any of its Affiliates in any Transaction Document, (C) Taxes
arising out of any action taken outside the ordinary course of business by
Arion or any of its Affiliates after the Closing but on the Closing Date, (D)
Taxes arising from or attributable to any Requested Sphinx Restructuring Steps
(except for Transfer Taxes as provided for in Section 6.9(b)), and (E) Taxes
of the Sphinx Indemnified Parties arising from or attributable to any Arion
Pre-Closing Restructuring Steps (except for Transfer Taxes as provided for in
Section 6.9(b)) or any other action taken by Arion and its Affiliates in order
to effectuate or otherwise incurred in connection with the restructuring
transactions contemplated in Section 2.8(b) hereof (provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, this clause (E) shall not take into account any Taxes from
the transfer of the Purchased Assets or Purchased Entities hereunder and from
any decisions by Arion or its Affiliates as to the jurisdiction or
jurisdictions in which the Purchased Assets or Purchased Entities are
transferred, including the transfer to Arion or any Other Arion Entity or
otherwise), in each case, excluding any additional Taxes that would not have
been incurred (to the extent that exceeds the Taxes that otherwise would have
been incurred) but for any breach of any covenant made by Sphinx or any of its
Affiliates and excluding any Taxes or other amounts subject to indemnification
under Section 6.9(a)(i) or Section 9.1(a) hereof. Notwithstanding that a claim
for Taxes may fall into multiple categories of this Section 6.9(a)(ii), a
Sphinx Indemnified Party may recover such Taxes one time only. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement and for the avoidance of doubt, the
limitations in Section 9.2 shall not apply to this Section 6.9(a)(ii).

(iii) With respect to the Business, in the case of any Straddle Period, the
amount of Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be deemed to be (A) in the case of Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis (such as real or personal property Taxes), the amount of such
Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period)
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in



the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant
Straddle Period and (B) in the case of Taxes not described in clause (A) (such
as franchise Taxes or Taxes that are based on or related to income or
receipts), the amount of any such Taxes shall be determined as if such taxable
period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

(b) Transfer Taxes.

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Transfer Taxes" shall mean all
transfer, sales, use, stamp, ad valorem, conveyance, VAT, custom duty,
documentary, registration and other similar Taxes (including charges for or in
connection with the recording of any instrument or document and any interest,
penalties, assessments or additions to tax resulting from, attributable to or
incurred in connection with any tax or any contest or dispute thereof, and
including any Liability for the Taxes of another Person) payable in connection
with the consummation of the Purchase Transactions and the Transfer of the
Purchased Shares and the Purchased Assets pursuant to this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents. The Liability for all Transfer Taxes shall be
borne one-half by Arion and one-half by Sphinx. Sphinx and Arion shall
cooperate with each other in the provision of any information or preparation
of any documentation that may be necessary or useful for obtaining any
available mitigation, reduction or exemption from any Transfer Taxes.

(ii) Unless the Parties mutually agree otherwise, any Tax Returns that must be
filed in connection with any Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed by the
Party required by Law to file such Tax Returns (the "Transfer Tax Returns"),
and subject to tax reimbursement or indemnification rights hereunder, such
Party shall pay the Transfer Taxes shown on such Tax Return within the period
specified by applicable Law. The filing party shall use its reasonable efforts
to provide the other Party with a draft copy of such Tax Return which it is
required to file at least seven Business Days before such Tax Returns are due
to be filed and shall consider in good faith any comments provided by such
other Party. All such Tax Returns shall be consistent with the allocation of
the Total Consideration as determined pursuant to Section 3.3. Arion shall
settle its obligations for any Liability for Transfer Taxes as defined in this
Section 6.9 within the period specified by applicable Law and shall reimburse
Sphinx for any Transfer Taxes paid by Sphinx within 20 Business Days of being
invoiced by Sphinx for such amount.

(c) Tax Returns.

(i) Except as provided in Section 6.9(b), Sphinx shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and duly file or cause to be duly filed, all Pre-Closing Tax Returns
in a timely manner with the appropriate Taxing Authorities; provided that all
Pre-Closing Tax Returns of any Purchased Entity shall (to the extent related
to the Purchased Shares, Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities or the
Business) be prepared using accounting methods and other practices that are
consistent with those used in the Tax Returns filed prior to the Closing
(except as otherwise required by applicable Law or to correct any clear
errors). As used herein, "Pre-Closing Tax Returns" shall mean (A) all Tax
Returns of the Purchased Entities prepared or filed on an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary basis with Sphinx or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than the Purchased Entities) and (B) all other Tax Returns (other than
as provided in Section 6.9(b)) for Tax periods ending on or before the Closing
Date that are of the Purchased Entities (the due date of which is after the
Closing Date) or



relate to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Business.
Sphinx will provide Arion with a copy of any income or other material Pre-
Closing Tax Returns of the Purchased Entities (excluding any Tax Returns filed
with Sphinx or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Purchased Entities) on
a group basis, as described in the foregoing clause (A)) at least 20 Business
Days before the due date for the filing of such Tax Return for Arion's review
and comment (and Sphinx shall incorporate any reasonable comments of Arion on
such Tax Returns).

(ii) Except as provided in Section 6.9(b), each Straddle Period Tax Return
shall be prepared and filed, or caused to be prepared and filed, with the
appropriate Taxing Authority (A) by Arion if it or any of its Affiliates is
permitted to file such Tax Return under applicable Law or (B) by Sphinx if
Arion and its Affiliates are not permitted to file such Tax Return under
applicable Law, in each case in a timely manner using accounting methods and
other practices that are consistent with past practice (except as otherwise
required by applicable Law or to correct any clear errors); provided that such
filing party (x) shall provide the other Party with a draft copy of such Tax
Return at least 30 Business Days before the due date for the filing of such
Tax Return (including extensions) for its review and comment, (y) shall
incorporate all reasonable comments of the other Party with respect to such
Straddle Period Tax Return and (z) shall provide the other Party with a
finalized copy of such Tax Return as soon as practicable before such due date.
The Party preparing the Straddle Period Tax Return shall not file such Tax
Return until the earlier of (I) the receipt of written notice from the other
Party indicating other Party's consent thereto or (II) one Business Day's
prior to the due date. As used herein, "Straddle Period Tax Returns" shall
mean all Tax Returns for Straddle Periods that are of the Purchased Entities
or relate to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities other than Transfer
Tax Returns and Tax Returns of the Purchased Minority Interests.

(iii) With respect to each Pre-Closing Tax Return described in this Section
6.9(c)(ii),the party required to file such Tax Return (or cause such Tax
Return to be filed) pursuant to this Section 6.9(c) (the "Tax Return Filer")
shall timely pay to the relevant Taxing Authority the amount, if any, shown as
due on such Tax Return; provided that if the Tax Return Filer is not permitted
to make such payment under applicable Law, then the Parties shall cooperate in
good faith to arrange for such amount to be paid to the relevant Taxing
Authority in a manner permitted by applicable Law; provided, further, that the
obligation to make payments pursuant to this Section 6.9(c)(iii) shall not
affect such Tax Return Filer's right, if any, to receive payments under
Section 6.9(c)(iv) or otherwise be indemnified under this Agreement with
respect to any Taxes.

(iv) On or before the due date of any Tax Return described in this Section 6.9
(including extensions), the relevant Tax Return Filer shall notify the other
Party of any amounts shown as due on such Tax Return (and to be paid by such
Tax Return Filer and its Affiliates or Subsidiaries, as applicable), or any
portions of any such amounts, for which the other Party must indemnify the Tax
Return Filer under this Agreement, and such other Party shall pay such amounts
(or portions thereof) to the Tax Return Filer no later than such due date or,
if later, 10 Business Days after the date on which notice of such amounts (or
portions thereof) is provided by the Tax Return Filer pursuant to this Section
6.9(c)(iv).



(d) Tax Refunds.

(i) After the Closing Date, except to the extent (A) included as an asset in
Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined hereunder, or (B)
attributable to the carryback of any loss from a Post-Closing Tax Period to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, if Arion or any of its Affiliates receives any Tax
refund of the Purchased Entities for the Pre-Closing Tax Period or with
respect to other Taxes for which Sphinx is responsible under Section 6.9(a)(i)
or an Overpayment Credit, in each case to the extent attributable to (x) Taxes
paid by or on behalf of Sphinx, any Purchased Entity or any of Sphinx's
Affiliates on or prior to the Closing Date, (y) Taxes actually indemnified by
Sphinx hereunder or (z) Taxes included as a liability in Closing Net Working
Capital (if any) (in each case, as finally determined hereunder), Arion shall
pay to Sphinx the entire amount of such refund or Overpayment Credit
(including any interest thereon from the Taxing Authorities, but net of any
Taxes imposed by, a Taxing Authority with respect to such Tax refund or other
costs and expenses incurred by Arion or its Affiliates) as soon as practicable
after receipt thereof; provided that if Arion is required to repay to the
relevant Taxing Authority such Tax refund, Sphinx shall repay the amount
previously paid by Arion to Sphinx pursuant to this Section 6.9(d) in respect
of such refund (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the
relevant Taxing Authority). Arion shall, at Sphinx's sole cost and expense,
prosecute in good faith and with reasonable diligence any Tax refund claims
filed by a Purchased Entity or with respect to the Purchased Assets prior to
the Closing which are identified in writing by Sphinx to Arion within 90 days
of the Closing Date. Arion shall also, if requested by Sphinx within 90 days
of the Closing Date, and at Sphinx's sole cost and expense, cause the relevant
entity to file for and attempt in good faith and with reasonable diligence to
obtain any Tax refund (or Overpayment Credit) that would give rise to a
payment under this Section 6.9(d); provided that, Arion shall only be required
to take such action if (A) pursuing or obtaining such refund is, in Arion's
good faith judgment (after consultation with applicable tax counsel),
reasonably expected to have the effect of increasing the Tax liability or
decreasing any Tax asset or attribute (other than the Tax refund payable to
Sphinx hereunder) of the Arion or its Affiliates in a Post-Closing Taxable
Period, and (B) the legal right to such Tax refund has a "more likely than
not" (or high confidence level) basis of being sustained if challenged by the
relevant governmental authority.

(ii) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law or in connection with the
resolution of any Tax Claim in accordance with Section 6.9(f), Arion shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, (A) make or change any Tax
election of the Purchased Entities or related to the Purchased Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities or the Business for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period, (B) amend, file, refile or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of
any applicable statute of limitations with respect to) any Pre-Closing Tax
Return or Straddle Period Tax Return or (C) carry back any Tax attribute,
including any loss, loss carry forward, credit, credit carry forward, prepaid
Tax or refund, and any claim for or right to receive any of the foregoing (a
"Tax Attribute") of any of the Purchased Entities from a Tax period ending
after the Closing Date to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (each, a "Post-Closing
Tax Action") in each case, without the prior written consent of Sphinx (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If Arion or
any of its Affiliates does carry back a Tax Attribute to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, then (x) no payment with respect to such carryback shall be due to
Arion or any of its Affiliates from Sphinx or any of its Subsidiaries and (y)
if Arion or any of its Affiliates receives any refund, credit or offset of any
Taxes in connection with such carryback, Arion shall promptly pay to Sphinx
the full



amount of such refund of Taxes pursuant to Section 6.9(d). After the Closing,
Sphinx shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, amend any
Tax Returns or change any Tax elections or accounting methods with respect to
any of the Purchased Entities, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities
or the Business relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent such
amendment or change could be expected to increase the Taxes of Arion or any of
its Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities) for which it would not
otherwise be indemnified under Section 6.9(a) unless such change is necessary
to comply with applicable Tax law, as reasonably determined in good faith by
Sphinx.

(e) Cooperation and Assistance.

(i) The Parties shall cooperate with each other in the preparation and filing
of any Tax Returns and the conduct of any audit or other Proceeding. They each
shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and make available such
other documents as are reasonably necessary to carry out the intent of this
Section 6.9.

(ii) If either Party is liable under this Section 6.9 including any amounts
due pursuant to Section 6.9(d), for any portion of a Tax shown due on any Tax
Return required to be filed by the other Party pursuant to this Section 6.9,
then the party required to file such Tax Return (or cause such Tax Return to
be filed) pursuant to this Section 6.9 (the "Tax Return Filer") shall deliver
a copy of the relevant portions of such Tax Return (taking into account any
extensions, if applicable) to the liable Party. If the Parties disagree as to
the treatment of any item shown on such Tax Return or with respect to any
calculation with respect to any Tax Return to be filed pursuant to this
Section 6.9, an independent public accounting firm acceptable to both Sphinx
and Arion shall determine, consistent with Sphinx's past practice (except as
otherwise required by Law), how the disputed item is to be treated on such Tax
Return ("Accountant's Determination"). If the Accountant's Determination has
not been made prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return, the Party
required to file such Tax Return may file such Tax return as it deems
appropriate, and if the subsequent Accountant's Determination is that such Tax
Return should have been filed in some other manner, the filing Party shall
amend such Tax Return in accordance with the Accountant's Determination.
Sphinx shall be deemed to be the prevailing party unless the public accounting
firm determines in favor of Arion with respect to more than one-half of the
amount of Taxes in dispute, in which case Arion shall be deemed to be the
prevailing party. The non-prevailing party with respect to the Accountant's
Determination shall pay its own fees and expenses and the fees and expenses of
the prevailing party, including fees and costs of counsel, reasonably incurred
in connection with the Accountant's Determination.

(iii) Upon request, each Party shall deliver to the tax director of the other
Party certified copies of all receipts for any foreign Tax with respect to
which such other Party or any of its Affiliates or subsidiaries (if any), as
applicable, could claim a foreign Tax credit or comparable Tax reduction and
any supporting documents required in connection with claiming or supporting a
claim for such a foreign Tax credit or comparable Tax reduction.

(iv) The Parties shall retain records, documents, accounting data and other
information in whatever form that are necessary for the preparation and
filing, or for any Tax audit, of any and all Tax Returns with respect to any
Taxes that relate to Tax periods that begin on or prior to the Closing Date.
Such retention shall be in accordance with the record retention policy of the
respective Party, but in no event shall any Party destroy or



otherwise dispose of such records, documents, accounting data and other
information prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including extensions). Each Party shall give any other Party reasonable
access to all such records, documents, accounting data and other information
as well as to its personnel and premises to the extent necessary for a
reasonable review or a Tax audit of such Tax Returns and relevant to an
obligation under this Section 6.9.

(v) Sphinx shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to provide Arion with a
clearance certificate or similar document(s) which may be required by any
Taxing Authority to relieve Arion of any obligation to withhold any portion of
the payments to Sphinx pursuant to this Agreement.

(f) Tax Controversies. A Party shall promptly notify the other Party in
writing (in no event later than 20 Business Days) (a "Notification") upon
receipt of written notice of any pending or threatened audits or assessments
with respect to Taxes for which such other Party (or any of its Affiliates or
Subsidiaries, as applicable) is liable under Section 6.9 or may give rise to
an indemnification payment under Section 6.9(a). Failure to give such
Notification shall not relieve the indemnifying party from Liability under
this Section 6.9, except if and to the extent the indemnifying party is
actually prejudiced thereby. Subject to further provisions of this Section
6.9(f), each Party shall be entitled to control and be solely responsible for
the defense of any tax audit or administrative or court Proceeding (a "Tax
Claim") relating to Taxes for which it may be solely liable, and to employ
counsel of its choice at its expense. Arion shall be entitled to take control
of the defense of any Tax Claim relating to Taxes for which it may be
partially liable; provided that Sphinx, at its sole cost and expense, shall
have the right to participate in any Tax Claim relating to Taxes for which it
may be partially liable. If Arion controls a Tax Claim relating to Taxes for
which Sphinx may be partially liable, (i) Arion shall conduct the defense of
the Tax Claim diligently and in good faith, (ii) Arion shall keep Sphinx
informed regarding the status of such Tax Claim and (iii) Arion shall not
settle, resolve, or abandon any such Tax Claim without Sphinx's prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the
extent such settlement, resolution or abandonment would increase Taxes for
which Sphinx is liable under this Agreement. If Arion chooses not to control a
Tax Claim, (A) Sphinx shall assume control of the Tax Claim and conduct the
defense of the Tax Claim diligently and in good faith, (B) Sphinx shall keep
Arion informed regarding the status of such Tax Claim, (C) Arion shall have
the right to participate in such Tax Claim at its sole cost and expense, and
(D) Sphinx shall not settle, resolve, or abandon any such Tax Claim without
Arion's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) to the extent such settlement, resolution or abandonment would
increase Taxes for which Arion is liable under this Agreement. This Section
6.9(f) shall govern to the extent it would otherwise be inconsistent with
Section 9.3.

Section 6.10 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

(a) If the Closing occurs, for a period of six years after the Closing, Arion
shall, and shall cause the Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries to, take
any necessary actions to provide that all rights to indemnification or expense
advancement and all limitations on Liability relating to the Business existing
in favor of the Business Indemnitees as provided in the DandO Indemnity
Arrangements shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and continue in full force and effect and be honored by the Purchased
Entities and their Subsidiaries after the Closing in accordance with their
terms (or be replaced with such rights and limitations as are no less
favorable thereto). As used herein, (x) the "Business Indemnitees" means
individuals who at or



prior to the Closing were current or former officers or directors of the
Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries (or the predecessors of the
Purchased Entities and their Subsidiaries) relating to service in such
capacities prior to the Closing and (y) the "DandO Indemnity Arrangements" means
(i) the Organizational Documents of the Purchased Entities and their
Subsidiaries in effect on the Agreement Date or (ii) any agreement providing
for indemnification by the Purchased Entities or their Subsidiaries of any of
the Business Indemnitees in effect on the Agreement Date to which the
Purchased Entities and/or their Subsidiaries are a party.

(b) In the event that the Purchased Entities, their Subsidiaries or Arion or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Purchased Entities, their Subsidiaries or Arion, as the case
may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10.

(c) The obligations of Arion under this Section 6.10 shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom
this Section 6.10 applies without the express written consent of such affected
indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this
Section 6.10 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10).

Section 6.11 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation.

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending three years
after the Closing Date (the "Non-Compete Period"), Sphinx will not, and will
cause its Subsidiaries not to, participate or engage in, or hold any ownership
interest in any Person who engages in, the design, development, manufacturing,
production, marketing, sale or servicing of any product, or the provision of
any service, that provides the same or substantially similar principal
functionality or services as the Products ("Competing Activity").

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing clause (a),
Sphinx and its Subsidiaries may in all events:

(i) engage in any business conducted by Sphinx or its Subsidiaries on the
Agreement Date (other than the Business) and continue to sell its products and
services as of the Agreement Date (other than Products), and any new releases,
updates and successors to such products and services;

(ii) design, develop, manufacture, produce, market, sell or service any
product or service utilizing public key infrastructure technology, including
but not limited to embedding mPKI (as such term is currently used in the
Business) into any product or service ("Permitted PKI Offerings"); provided,
however, Permitted PKI Offerings do not include operating as a public
Certificate Authority, including (x) any offer for sale on a standalone basis
publicly-trusted "DV" (Domain Validated), "OV" (Organization Validated) and or
"EV" (Extended Validation) certificates, or (y) any license, sale or provide
as a service any standalone customer facing SSL/TLS certificate management
software product in each case as those terms are currently defined in the
Business at Closing



(iii) continue to perform any Competing Activity for the benefit of Arion or
any of its Affiliates as required or expressly contemplated by this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document;

(iv) acquire any Person, or one or more divisions or lines of business of a
Person, that engages in a Competing Activity by merger or a purchase of shares
or assets of a Person so long as, immediately prior to the time of such
acquisition, the Competing Activity does not account for more than 20% of the
aggregate annual gross revenues of such Person, or divisions or lines of
business of such Person, to be so acquired for its most recent fiscal year
preceding the acquisition; provided, however, that in the event of such
acquisition where the aggregate annual gross revenue related to the Competing
Activity exceeds 20% of the aggregate annual gross revenue of the Person or
divisions or lines of business of such Person, Sphinx shall be permitted to
acquire such Person or business so long as it divests the portion of the
Person or business that engages in the Competing Activity within 18 months of
the acquisition thereof; provided, further, that such 18 month period shall be
extended to the date on which all approvals from a Governmental Authority
required to complete the divestiture are received (to no later than the third
anniversary following the acquisition of such Person or divisions or lines of
business of such Person) if such approvals are not received by the end of such
18 month period; and

(v) own and operate any Person, division or line of business acquired in
compliance with clause (iii) above; provided that, any such division or line
of business does not account for more than 5% of the aggregate annual gross
revenues of Sphinx and its Subsidiaries during the Non-Compete Period.

(c) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending 12 months
after the Closing Date, Sphinx will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not
to, directly or indirectly, solicit to hire or, in such jurisdictions where
such restriction would not be prohibited by Law, hire in any capacity (whether
as an employee, consultant, independent contractor or otherwise) any employee
of Arion or its Subsidiaries who has the title of director or other equivalent
or higher position (including any Continuing Employee) or any other employee
of Arion or its Subsidiaries to whom Sphinx is introduced, of whom Sphinx has
become aware, or with whom Sphinx has otherwise had substantial contact, as a
result of the preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. This restriction shall not
apply to Persons that have been terminated by Arion or its Subsidiaries for at
least 90 days prior to commencement of employment discussions between Sphinx
or its Subsidiaries or its or their representatives and such Person and
nothing in this clause (c) shall restrict Sphinx or its Subsidiaries from
engaging in general or public searches, solicitations or advertising by or on
behalf of Sphinx or such Subsidiary (including through search firms) that is
not specifically directed towards any such Person described in the first
sentence of this clause (c).

(d) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending 12 months
after the Closing Date, Arion will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not
to, directly or indirectly, solicit to hire or, in such jurisdictions where
such restriction would not be prohibited by Law, hire in any capacity (whether
as an employee, consultant, independent contractor or otherwise) any employee
of Sphinx or its Subsidiaries who has the title of director or other
equivalent or higher position, or any other employee of Sphinx or its
Subsidiaries to whom Arion is introduced, of whom Arion has become aware, or
with whom Arion has otherwise had substantial contact, as a result of the
preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the
transactions



contemplated hereby (other than the Business Employees). This restriction
shall not apply to Persons who have been terminated by Sphinx or its
Subsidiaries at least 90 days prior to commencement of employment discussions
between Arion or its Subsidiaries or its or their representatives and such
Person and nothing in this clause (d) shall restrict Arion or its Subsidiaries
from engaging in general or public searches, solicitations or advertising by
or on behalf of Arion or such Subsidiary (including through search firms) that
is not specifically directed towards any such Person described in the first
sentence of this clause (d).

(e) If after Closing and during the Non-Compete Period Sphinx or any of its
Subsidiaries desire to purchase PKI certificates from a third party for use in
Permitted PKI Offerings, it will purchase those certificates from Arion, so
long as Arion can meet the applicable Sphinx technical requirements and agrees
to sell those certificates at fair market prices and terms, and in no event
less favorable pricing and terms than the most favorable pricing and terms
offered by Arion to any similarly situated customer.

(f) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and agreements set
forth in this Section 6.11 were a material inducement to the other Party to
enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. Sphinx
hereby acknowledges that the restrictive covenants set forth in Section
6.11(a) are reasonable in terms of duration, scope and area restrictions and
are limited to the scope that is necessary to protect the goodwill of the
Business and to prevent the impairment of the value of the substantial
investment therein being made by Arion hereunder. The Parties agree that, if
any court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment
determines that a specified time period, a specified geographical area, a
specified business limitation or any other relevant feature of this Section
6.11 is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser time
period, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant feature which
is determined by such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and not against
public policy may be enforced against the applicable Party. It is agreed that
any breach or threatened breach of the restrictive covenants set forth in this
Section 6.11 would cause irreparable injury to the non-breaching Party and
that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to the non-breaching
Party.

Section 6.12 Further Assurances; Wrong Pockets.

(a) General Assurances. In addition to the actions specifically provided for
elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the Parties will cooperate with each
other and use its reasonable efforts, prior to, at and after the Closing Date,
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
all things reasonably necessary or appropriate on its part to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Purchase
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the
satisfaction of the respective conditions set forth in Article 7 and including
the execution and delivery of such other instruments, certificates, agreements
and other documents and the performance of such other actions as may be
necessary or reasonably desirable to consummate and implement expeditiously
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents; provided that all such actions are in accordance with applicable
Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from time to time, whether at or after the
Closing, Sphinx and its Subsidiaries (as appropriate) will execute and deliver
such further instruments, certificates, agreements and other documents and
perform such other actions, at Sphinx's sole expense and subject to Section
3.6(b), as Arion may reasonably require to more effectively Transfer to Arion
any of the Purchased Assets or Purchased Shares and Arion will execute and
deliver such instruments, certificates, agreements and other documents and
perform such other actions, at Sphinx's sole expense, as Sphinx or its
Subsidiaries may reasonably require for Arion to



more effectively assume the Assumed Liabilities. Neither Arion nor Sphinx will
be required to make any payments, incur any Liability, or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party in connection with
obtaining any Consent of any Person. The obligations of each Party under this
Section 6.12(a) shall expire 18 months after the Closing Date.

(b) Wrong Pockets. In the event that, on or after the Closing, either Party
receives payments or funds or, in the case of Sphinx, retains Purchased
Assets, or in the case of Arion, receives Excluded Assets, or such Party
discovers funds or, in the case of Sphinx, Purchased Assets, or in the case of
Arion, Excluded Assets, due or belonging to the other Party pursuant to the
terms hereof or any of the Transaction Documents, then the Party receiving or
discovering such payments or funds or, in the case of Sphinx, Purchased
Assets, or in the case of Arion, Excluded Assets shall promptly forward or
Transfer or cause to be promptly forwarded or Transferred such payments or
funds or, in the case of Sphinx, Purchased Assets, or in the case of Arion,
Excluded Assets, to the proper party (with appropriate endorsements, as
applicable), for no additional consideration and will account to such other
Party for all such receipts. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, there is no right of offset regarding
such payments and a Party may not withhold funds received from third parties
for the account of the other Party in the event there is a dispute regarding
any other issue under this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents.
Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.12(b), Sphinx
agrees that Arion shall, following the Closing, have the right and authority
to endorse any checks or drafts received by Arion in respect of any account
receivable of the Business included in the Purchased Assets or reflected in
the Final Closing Net Working Capital and Sphinx shall furnish to Arion such
evidence of this authority as Arion may reasonably request. Following the
Closing, if Arion or its Affiliates receives any mail or packages addressed to
Sphinx or its Subsidiaries and delivered to Arion not relating to the
Business, the Purchased Assets, the Purchased Shares or the Assumed
Liabilities, Arion shall promptly deliver (or cause to be delivered) such mail
or packages to Sphinx. Following the Closing, if Sphinx or its Subsidiaries
receives any mail or packages delivered to Sphinx relating to the Business,
the Purchased Assets, the Purchased Shares or the Assumed Liabilities, Sphinx
shall promptly deliver (or cause to be delivered) such mail or packages to
Arion. Without limiting the foregoing, if within 60 days after Closing, Arion
identifies any Patents that it believes are "Exclusive to the Business", then
provided that Sphinx confirms (such confirmation not to be unreasonably
withheld) that such Patents are "Exclusive to the Business", then such Patents
will be deemed to be part of the Purchased Assets and Sphinx will assign such
Patents to Arion through an appropriate amendment to the IPMA. For purposes of
the immediately preceding sentence, a Patent will be considered "Exclusive to
the Business" if (x) all named inventors are or were working within the
Business at the time the claimed invention was conceived or first reduced to
practice; and (y) all claims in the Patent are exclusively related to the
Business, Products or Transferred Technology.

Section 6.13 Privileges. The Parties agree that their respective rights and
obligations to maintain, preserve, assert or waive any attorney-client and
work product privileges belonging to either Party with respect to the Business
and the other businesses of Sphinx or Arion, as applicable (collectively,
"Privileges"), shall be governed by the provisions of this Section 6.13. With
respect to matters relating to Sphinx's businesses, the Excluded Assets or the
Excluded Liabilities, in each case regardless of whether such matters also
relate to the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, and
with respect to all business records, documents, communications or other
information (collectively, "Information") of Sphinx or any Affiliate prepared
in connection with this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, Sphinx shall have sole authority
to determine whether to assert or waive any Privileges, including the right to
assert any Privilege against Arion and its Affiliates. Arion and its
Affiliates (including, as of the Closing Date, the Purchased Entities) shall
take no action without the prior



written consent of Sphinx that would reasonably be expected to result in any
waiver of any such Privileges of Sphinx. With respect to matters relating to
Arion's businesses (not including the Business, the Purchased Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities prior to Closing) and with respect to all Information of
Arion or any Affiliate prepared in connection with this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
Arion shall have sole authority to determine whether to assert or waive any
Privileges, including the right to assert any Privilege against Sphinx and its
Affiliates. Sphinx and its Affiliates shall take no action without the prior
written consent of Arion that would reasonably be expected to result in any
waiver of any such Privileges of Arion. After the Closing, Arion shall have
sole authority to determine whether to assert or waive any Privileges with
respect to matters relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets, the
Purchased Shares and the Assumed Liabilities (but not including the Excluded
Assets, Excluded Liabilities, Information prepared in connection with this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby or any other potential transaction relating to the Business
or related sale process, or matters that relate to the businesses of Sphinx
(other than the Business)). However, Arion may not assert any such Privileges
of the Purchased Entities, Sphinx or its Affiliates related to pre-Closing
advice or communications relating to the Business against Sphinx and its
Affiliates; provided, however, that, if the waiver (or failure to assert such
Privilege) would reasonably be expected to result in such Privilege being
waived in connection with any claim by a third party in connection with the
Purchased Assets, the Purchased Shares or the Assumed Liabilities, Sphinx
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to
enter into such reasonable arrangements designed to ensure that such Privilege
is not otherwise waived with respect to such third party, including customary
joint defense agreements or similar arrangements. Sphinx and its Subsidiaries
shall take no action after the Closing without the prior written consent of
Arion that would reasonably be expected to result in any waiver of any such
Privileges of Arion. The rights and obligations created by this Section 6.13
shall apply to all Information as to which Sphinx, Arion, their respective
Subsidiaries or the Purchased Entities would be entitled to assert or has
asserted a Privilege without regard to the effect, if any, of the transactions
contemplated hereby or by the other Transaction Documents (the "Privileged
Information"). Upon receipt by Sphinx or its Subsidiaries, or Arion and its
Affiliates (including, as of the Closing Date, the Purchased Entities), as the
case may be, of any subpoena, discovery or other request from any third party
that actually or arguably calls for the production or disclosure of Privileged
Information of the other or if Sphinx or its Subsidiaries or Arion or its
Affiliates (including, as of the Closing Date, the Purchased Entities), as the
case may be, obtains knowledge that any current or former employee of Sphinx,
its Affiliates or the Purchased Entities or Arion or its Affiliates
(including, as of the Closing Date, the Purchased Entities), has received any
subpoena, discovery or other request from any third party that actually or
arguably calls for the production or disclosure of Privileged Information of
the other Party, such Party shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
promptly notify the other of the existence of the request and shall provide
the other a reasonable opportunity to review the Information and to assert any
rights it may have under this Section 6.13 or otherwise to prevent the
production or disclosure of Privileged Information. Sphinx's transfer of any
Business Records or other Information to Arion in accordance with this
Agreement and Sphinx's and Arion's agreement to permit the other to obtain
Information existing prior to the Closing are made in reliance on the Parties'
respective agreements, as set forth in this Section 6.13 and Section 6.3, to
maintain the confidentiality of information and to take the steps provided
herein for the preservation of all Privileges that may belong to or be
asserted by Sphinx or Arion, as the case may be. The access to Business
Records and other information being granted pursuant to Section 6.3, Section
6.4, Section 6.6, Section 6.9 and Section 9.3, and the disclosure to Arion and
Sphinx of Privileged Information relating to the Business or the other
businesses of Sphinx or Arion, as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or any other Transaction
Document shall not be asserted by Sphinx or Arion to constitute, or otherwise
be deemed, a waiver of any Privilege that has been or may be asserted under
this Section 6.13 or otherwise.

Section 6.14 [Reserved].



Section 6.15 Delivery of Business Financial Statements.

(a) During the period from the Agreement Date until the earlier of the Closing
Date or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 10, Sphinx shall
deliver to Arion unaudited combined non-GAAP balance sheets and income
statements of the Business prepared on the same basis, and subjected to the
same level of internal and external review, as the Sphinx Unaudited Financial
Statements, including the notes thereto, for each fiscal quarter ending at
least 45 days before the Closing Date (the "Required Financial Information"),
in each case, as soon as reasonably practicable following, but in any event
within 45 days after, the date of the applicable fiscal quarter end. Arion
shall, promptly on request by Sphinx, reimburse Sphinx for all of the
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Sphinx incurred
by Sphinx in providing the balance sheets and income statements described in
this Section 6.15(a).

(b) From and after the date that is 60 days after the Agreement Date, Sphinx
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, use their
reasonable efforts to cooperate and assist Arion with the preparation of
audited "carve-out" combined financial statements with respect to the
Business. Arion shall, promptly on request by Sphinx, reimburse Sphinx for the
reasonable, out-of-pocket costs incurred by Sphinx and owed to external
resources in providing the cooperation and assistance described in this
Section 6.15(b) (it being understood that Sphinx shall be permitted to retain
external resources that it determines in its good faith sole discretion are
appropriate to satisfy its obligations under this Section 6.15(b)).

Section 6.16 Arion Financing.

(a) Arion shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and subject only to the
conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitment and the Fee Letters,
including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly negotiate
definitive agreements on the terms and subject only to the conditions
contained in the Debt Financing Commitment (including any market flex
provisions) so that such agreements are in effect on the Closing Date, (ii)
promptly satisfy (or obtain a waiver to) or cause the satisfaction (or waiver)
of all conditions in the Debt Financing Commitment and the definitive
agreements for the Debt Financing, (iii) consummate the Debt Financing on the
terms and subject only to the conditions (including accepting to the fullest
extent any modifications to the Debt Financing pursuant to any market flex
provisions) contained in the Debt Financing Commitment (including by causing
the Debt Financing Sources and the other Persons providing the Debt Financing
to provide such Debt Financing) on or prior to the date on which the Closing
is required to occur pursuant to Section 8.1, (iv) enforce its rights under
the Debt Financing Commitment in the event of any breach thereof, (v) comply
with and maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitment on the terms and
conditions thereof and (vi) in the event that the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1, Section 7.3 and in the Debt Financing Commitment have been
satisfied or, upon funding would be satisfied, cause the Debt Financing
Sources to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Closing (or if lesser, the Required Amount).

(b) In the event that, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by
Arion to satisfy its obligations under Section 6.16(a), any portion of the
Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and subject only to the
conditions (including any market flex provisions) contemplated in the Debt
Financing Commitment (unless such portion is not reasonably required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), Arion shall
promptly notify Sphinx (and in any event, within two Business Days) thereof
and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative



financing for the Required Amount as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the occurrence of such event; provided that such alternative
financing shall not have any of the effects described in clauses (A) through
(E) of clause (c)(i) below or be directly or indirectly provided by Sphinx or
its Affiliates; provided, further, that Arion shall not be obligated to seek
or obtain financing on terms or conditions materially less favorable (taken as
a whole) to Arion than those contained in the Debt Financing Commitments
(including any market flex provisions). Arion shall deliver to Sphinx true and
complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such alternative
source shall have committed to provide Arion with any portion of the Debt
Financing substantially concurrently with the execution thereof.

(c) Arion shall have the right from time to time to amend, replace, supplement
or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Debt Financing
Commitment or definitive agreement relating to the Debt Financing; provided,
however, that (i) without the prior written consent of Sphinx, no such
amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver shall (A) reduce
(or have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
(including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount in respect of the Debt Financing other than as set forth in the Fee
Letters or as covered by a corresponding increase in any equity commitment)
unless the representations in Section 5.12(d) hereof (as though made at the
time of the effectuation of such amendment, modification, supplement or
replacement) shall remain true and correct after taking into account such
reduction, (B) add conditions precedent to the Debt Financing or amend,
replace, supplement or modify any existing conditions precedent to the Debt
Financing in a manner adverse to Arion (or its Affiliates) or that would
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay or make less likely to
occur the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
the Debt Financing), (C) reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or
materially delay the availability of the Debt Financing, (D) adversely impact
the ability of Arion to enforce or cause the enforcement of its rights under
the Debt Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements relating to the
Debt Financing or (E) impose obligations on Sphinx or its Subsidiaries without
Sphinx's consent and (ii) it is understood and agreed that Arion may amend the
Debt Financing Commitment to add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents,
managers, commitment parties or similar entities that have not executed the
Debt Financing Commitment as of the Agreement Date.

(d) To the extent Arion obtains alternative financing pursuant to Section
6.16(b), or amends, replaces, supplements, modifies or waives any of the
Financing pursuant to Section 6.16(c), references to the "Debt Financing" and
"Debt Financing Commitment" (and other like terms in this Agreement) shall be
deemed to refer to such alternative financing, or the Financing as so amended,
replaced, supplemented, modified or waived.

(e) Arion shall keep Sphinx informed on a timely basis upon reasonable request
and in reasonable detail of the status of Arion's efforts to arrange and
obtain the Debt Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Arion shall notify
Sphinx promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) if at any time
prior to the Closing Date: (i) the Debt Financing Commitment expires or is
terminated for any reason, (ii) Arion obtains knowledge of any material breach
or default by any party to any Debt Financing Commitment, (iii) Arion receives
any written communication from any Person providing a Debt Financing
Commitment with respect to any (A) actual, potential or threatened breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Financing
Commitment with respect to a material provision of the Debt Financing
Commitment or (B) a material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to the Debt Financing Commitment with respect to the obligation to
fund the Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to be



funded at Closing or (iv) any other event or development occurs that Arion
should reasonably expect may have a material and adverse impact on the ability
of Arion to obtain all or any material portion of the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment on the terms, in the manner or
from the sources contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment or the
definitive documents related to the Debt Financing or Arion, for any reason,
otherwise no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all
or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms described in the Debt
Financing Commitment. As soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event
within two Business Days after the date Sphinx delivers to Arion a written
request therefor), Arion shall provide any information reasonably requested by
Sphinx relating to the status of the Financing and any circumstance referred
to in clause (i) through (iv) of the immediately preceding sentence.

(f) Sphinx shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide, shall cause its
Subsidiaries and their respective representatives to use reasonable best
efforts to provide such reasonable cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by Arion, in
each case at Arion's sole expense, including its reasonable best efforts to
(i) participate (and use reasonable best efforts to cause members of senior
management of Sphinx and/or the Business to participate) in meetings,
presentations and due diligence sessions with the Debt Financing Sources, (ii)
furnish Arion and the Debt Financing Sources and rating agencies with
historical and projected financial and other pertinent information regarding
the Business as may be reasonably requested by Arion or the Debt Financing
Sources in connection with the Debt Financing, in each case to the extent
reasonably available to Sphinx, (iii) assist Arion and the Debt Financing
Sources in the preparation of customary marketing materials for any portion of
the Debt Financing, (iv) provide reasonable and customary cooperation with any
marketing efforts of Arion and the Debt Financing Sources for any portion of
the Debt Financing (including executing customary authorization letters
authorizing the distribution of information about Sphinx to prospective
lenders and containing a customary representation to the Debt Financing
Sources that the public side versions of marketing materials, if any, do not
include material non-public information about the Business for purposes of
U.S. federal and state securities laws), (v) facilitate the pledging of
collateral, (vi) furnish Arion and the Debt Financing Sources at least three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date with all customary documentation and
other information required with respect to the Debt Financing under applicable
"know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations as is
reasonably requested in writing by the Lead Arrangers at least 10 days prior
to the Closing Date and (vii) satisfy the conditions precedent set forth in
the Debt Financing Commitment to the extent satisfaction thereof requires the
cooperation, and is within the control, of any Sphinx, its Subsidiaries or
their respective representatives; provided that (x) neither Sphinx nor any of
its Subsidiaries (including, prior to Closing, the Purchased Entities) shall
be required to pledge any assets as collateral, execute any definitive
agreement in respect of the Debt Financing or any closing certificate, pay any
commitment or other similar fee, incur any other Liability in connection with
the Debt Financing or issue any offering memo, bank book or similar document
with respect to the Debt Financing and (y) no obligation of any Purchased
Entity under any document, certificate or instrument executed pursuant to this
Section 6.16(f) shall be effective, in each case of (x) and (y), until the
Closing (other than, in the case of clause (x) or (y), executing customary
authorization letters authorizing the distribution of information about Sphinx
to prospective lenders). Arion shall be responsible for all reasonable and
documented fees and expenses related to the Debt Financing and shall promptly
reimburse upon request of Sphinx, all documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel)
incurred by Sphinx or its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of
Sphinx as contemplated by this Section 6.16. Arion shall, and hereby agrees
to, indemnify and hold harmless Sphinx, its Subsidiaries and their respective
representatives from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with



the arrangement of the Debt Financing except to the extent such Losses arise
out of or result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Sphinx,
its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives. All non-public or other
Confidential Information provided by Sphinx or its representatives pursuant to
this Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that Arion will be permitted to disclose
such information to any financing sources or prospective financing sources and
other financial institutions and investors that may become parties to the Debt
Financing and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents in
connection with the Debt Financing (and, in each case, to their respective
counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons (A) agree to be bound by the
Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto or (B) are subject to other
confidentiality undertakings that are customary or are reasonably satisfactory
to Sphinx and of which Sphinx is a beneficiary.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Arion
acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to consummate the Purchase
Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby and by the other
Transaction Documents is not contingent upon Arion obtaining the Debt
Financing or any other third-party financing. In the event that Arion fails to
obtain the full Required Amount at or after the time the Closing would
otherwise occur until the Outside Date, without prejudice to any other remedy
which may be available to the Parties by Law or this Agreement, Sphinx may, in
its sole discretion, elect the alternative set forth on Schedule 6.16(g) of
the Sphinx Disclosure Letter. Sphinx, its controlled Affiliates and its
Subsidiaries shall not be, and shall not take any actions to become, whether
directly or indirectly (including through any Debt Financing Source or the
syndication of any Debt Financing), a lender of the Debt Financing or a Debt
Financing Source, including pursuant to any alternative debt financing.

Section 6.17 Transition Services.

(a) Subject to Section 6.17(b), as promptly as practicable following the
execution of this Agreement, Arion and Sphinx agree to negotiate in good faith
concerning any additions, modifications, adjustments or clarifications with
respect to the schedules set forth in Schedule 6.17 of the Sphinx Disclosure
Letter (as may be amended by the Parties in accordance with the terms of this
Section 6.17, the "Preliminary Transition Service Schedules") so as to
finalize the Transition Service Schedules to be attached to the Transition
Services Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sphinx will not be required to provide a
Transition Service that (i) is an Excluded Service; or (ii) either (A) was not
provided to the Business by Sphinx, including in connection with the Shared
Services, during the 12-month period preceding the Agreement Date or (B) is
not reasonably necessary in connection with the transition of the Business to
Arion as conducted during the 12-month period preceding the Agreement Date;
provided that, if Sphinx did not provide a Transition Service as set forth in
subsection (ii)(A) above, if such Transition Service is reasonably necessary
in connection with the transition of the Business to Arion as currently
conducted and is so requested by Arion, the parties will negotiate in good
faith to establish a Transition Service Schedule (including applicable fees
payable to Sphinx in accordance with this Section 6.17) pursuant to which
Sphinx will provide an additional Transition Service solely in the form of
assistance and cooperation reasonably required to enable a third party service
providers to provide all elements of the requested Transition Service, with
such third party service provider to be selected and managed (and paid for) by
Arion at its sole cost and expense.

(c) Unless otherwise agreed by Arion and Sphinx or set forth in the
Preliminary Transition Service Schedules, no Transition Period will last for
more than 12 months following the



Closing Date (excluding any extensions made to the Transition Period in
accordance with the terms of the Transition Services Agreement).

(d) Arion and Sphinx agree that, unless otherwise provided in the Preliminary
Transition Service Schedules, the pricing for any Transition Service shall be
equal to the Service Provider's fully-loaded cost (which shall include actual
cost and pro-rated overhead allocation), which will be determined in a manner
consistent with the methodology used to calculate fees for similar Transition
Services, if any, as set forth in the applicable Pre-Closing Transition
Service Schedule.

(e) Any requests to add additional Transition Services to the Preliminary
Transition Service Schedules or to make any other modifications, adjustments
or clarifications to the Preliminary Transition Service Schedules must be made
in writing by the requesting Party within 60 days after the Agreement Date. To
the extent that, notwithstanding such good faith efforts, Arion and Sphinx are
unable to agree upon the Transition Service Schedules to be attached to the
Transition Services Agreement prior to the earlier of 60 days after the
Agreement Date and the date this Agreement has been validly terminated
pursuant to Article 10, such unresolved matters shall be referred for
resolution to the chief financial officer of Sphinx, on the one hand, and
chief financial officer of Arion, on the other hand, who shall work together
in good faith to reach final resolution within 10 days of such referral.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that 120 days after the Agreement
Date, neither the Closing has occurred nor this Agreement has been validly
terminated pursuant to Article 10, either Arion or Sphinx may request in
writing to add additional Transition Services or make other modifications,
adjustments or clarifications to the Preliminary Transition Service Schedules
that meet the conditions described in Section 6.17(b), and the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith concerning such modifications, adjustments or
clarifications in accordance with the terms of this Section 6.17; provided
that if any such matters remain unresolved as of the Closing, the Parties
shall continue such negotiations after Closing in accordance with and subject
to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement.

(f) Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Transition Services
Agreement, and subject to Section 2.6, all Shared Services provided to the
Business by Sphinx, including pursuant to a Contract that is the subject of
Section 2.6 shall cease as of the Closing Date.

(g) As promptly as practicable following the Agreement Date, and solely for
the purposes of defining the damages limitations for Section 6.2(b) of the
Transition Services Agreement, Arion and Sphinx agree to negotiate in good
faith to establish an estimate of amounts to be paid to Service Provider under
the Transition Services Agreement for all applicable Transition Services
identified by Arion and Sphinx in the Transition Service Schedules as being
within the same functional area (as such areas are identified on Exhibit A of
the Transition Services Agreement), and at the Closing, subject to Section
6.17(e), Exhibit A to the Transition Services Agreement shall be updated to
reflect such agreed upon amounts.

(h) Capitalized terms used in this Section 6.17 but not otherwise defined in
this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the
Transition Services Agreement.

Section 6.18 Guarantees. Arion recognizes that Sphinx and certain of its
Subsidiaries have provided credit support to the Business, the Purchased
Assets or the Purchased Entities pursuant to guarantees, letters of credit,
bonds, sureties and other credit support or assurances provided by Sphinx or
its Subsidiaries in support of any obligation of the Business (the "Business
Guarantees"), each as set forth on Schedule 6.18 of the Sphinx Disclosure
Letter, and that Sphinx may supplement Schedule 6.18 of the Sphinx Disclosure



Letter from time to time prior to Closing to include any additional Business
Guarantees entered into after the Agreement Date (to the extent permitted by
Section 6.1(a) of this Agreement). Following the Agreement Date, Arion and
Sphinx shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain from the
respective beneficiary, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Sphinx, on or before the Closing Date, valid and binding written releases of
Sphinx and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, from any Liability, whether
arising before, on or after the Closing Date, under any Business Guarantees
listed on Schedule 6.18 of the Sphinx Disclosure Letter (as supplemented prior
to the Closing Date) (such Business Guarantees, the "Scheduled Guarantees"),
which release shall be effective as of the Closing, including, in the case of
Arion and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, by providing substitute guarantees,
furnishing letters of credit, posting surety or performance bonds or making
other arrangements as the beneficiary may reasonably request. If any Scheduled
Guarantee has not been released as of the Closing Date, then Arion and Sphinx
shall continue to use their respective reasonable best efforts after the
Closing to cause as promptly as practicable the complete and unconditional
release of Sphinx and its Subsidiaries under such Business Guarantee. Arion
shall, and hereby agrees to, indemnify and hold harmless Sphinx and its
Subsidiaries from and after the Closing for any amounts required to be paid
under any Business Guarantees that relate to the post-Closing period (it being
understood and agreed that Sphinx and its Subsidiaries shall be responsible
for all costs and expenses associated with such Business Guarantees prior to
the Closing), except as a result of Sphinx or any of its Subsidiaries' gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

Section 6.19 Existing Intercompany Agreements and Arrangements.

(a) Except as set forth in Section 6.19(b), Arion acknowledges and agrees that
all Sphinx Intercompany Agreements, and all rights and obligations of the
Business or the Purchased Entities under such Sphinx Intercompany Agreements
will be terminated at or prior to the Closing. No such terminated Sphinx
Intercompany Agreement or any arrangement, commitment or understanding
relating thereto (including any provision thereof that purports to survive
termination) shall be of any further force or effect after the Effective Time.
Arion and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Purchased
Entities) shall have no Liability or obligation in respect of such Sphinx
Intercompany Agreement, whether arising prior to, on or after the Closing
Date.

(b) The provisions of Section 6.19(a) shall not apply to any of the following
agreements, arrangements, commitments or understandings (or to any of the
provisions thereof):

(i) this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and each other agreement,
arrangement, commitment or understanding expressly contemplated by this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document to be entered into or continued
after the Effective Time; and

(ii) the Shared Contracts and the arrangements for Subcontracted Work, which
are addressed in Section 2.6.

Section 6.20 Cooperation in Litigation. Without limiting the obligations of
the Parties under Article 9, from and after the Closing, the Parties shall
reasonably cooperate with each other in the investigation, prosecution or
defense of any Proceedings (other than Proceedings with respect to Taxes)
arising from or related to the conduct of the Business, the ownership, assets
or Liabilities of the Purchased Entities, the ownership, operation or use of
the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Excluded Assets or the
Excluded Liabilities and, in each case, involving one or more third parties.
Such reasonable cooperation shall include using reasonable best efforts in (a)
providing, and causing their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries, as
applicable, to provide, documentary or other evidence, (b) implementing, and
causing their respective Affiliates to implement, record retention, litigation
holds or other documentary or evidence



policies or (c) making, and causing their respective Affiliates to make,
available directors, officers and employees to give depositions or testimony,
all as reasonably requested by the requesting Party from time to time. Except
as otherwise provided in Article 9, the Party requesting such cooperation
shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such
cooperation (including reasonable legal fees and disbursements) by the Party
(or Affiliate thereof, as the case may be) providing such cooperation and by
its officers, directors, employees and agents, but not including reimbursing
such Party (or Affiliate thereof, as the case may be) or its officers,
directors, employees and agents for their time spent in such cooperation.

Section 6.21 Exclusivity. During the period from the Agreement Date until the
earlier of the Closing Date and termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article 10, Sphinx will not, nor will it authorize or permit any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives to, directly or indirectly: (a) solicit or
knowingly encourage, facilitate or induce the making, submission or
announcement of, or take any other action designed or reasonably likely to
facilitate, any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer concerning
the sale or other conveyance of any portion of the Business as an alternative
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (an "Acquisition Proposal")
from any Person other than Arion or its Affiliates or Representatives, (b)
deliver or make available to any Person any nonpublic information with respect
to the Business or afford access to the properties, books, records or
representatives of the Business to any Person (other than Arion or its
Affiliates or Representatives, or as required by applicable Law) or (c)
negotiate, or accept any proposals, offers or inquiries from, or enter into
any Contract with, any Person relating to or in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no
event shall any transaction or proposal with respect to an acquisition of
control of Sphinx (whether by way of merger, purchase of capital stock,
purchase of assets, joint venture, license, lease or otherwise) constitute an
Acquisition Proposal. In the event that Sphinx or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives receives an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal from any Person
after the Agreement Date and prior to the Closing Date, Sphinx will provide
Arion with notice of such event and a summary of the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that Sphinx will not be required to
disclose the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such
Acquisition Proposal.

shall promptly negotiate definitive versions of the Sphinx Other Agreements to
which it is a party, in each case to be entered into and effective as of the
Closing.

Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, effectuate and consummate the Sphinx Pre-

Restructuring Documents within a reasonable time frame (but in any event, no
later than five Business Days) prior to their anticipated execution or
effectiveness.

Section 6.24 Enforcement of Employee and Bidder NDAs.

(a) Employee NDAs. Following the Closing, in the event (i) Sphinx provides
written notice to Arion of an actual or threatened breach, or actions that
would reasonably be expected to result in a breach, of an Employee NDA by the
applicable employee counterparty and (ii) Sphinx reasonably requests that it
be permitted to take action against such employee in order to protect Sphinx's
interests under the applicable Employee NDA which interests would be harmed by
such breach, Arion shall, at Sphinx's expense, promptly take all actions
reasonably necessary to permit and authorize Sphinx to enforce Arion's rights
under the applicable Employee NDA on behalf and for the benefit of Sphinx or
its applicable Subsidiary or Affiliate.



(b) Bidder NDAs. Following the Closing, in the event (i) Arion provides
written notice to Sphinx of an actual or threatened breach, or actions that
would reasonably be expected to result in a breach, of a Bidder NDA by the
applicable third party counterparty with respect to the confidential
information of the Business and (ii) Arion reasonably requests in such notice
that Sphinx take action against such counterparty in order to protect Arion's
interests in preserving the confidentiality of such confidential information
of the Business under the applicable Bidder NDA which interests would be
harmed by such breach, Sphinx shall, at Arion's expense, promptly take all
actions reasonably necessary to permit and authorize Arion to enforce or cause
the enforcement of Sphinx's rights under the applicable Bidder NDA on behalf
and for the benefit of Arion or its applicable Subsidiary or Affiliate.

(c) Cooperation. Each of the Parties shall cooperate reasonably, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to cooperate reasonably, in the

contemplated by this Section 6.24. Such cooperation shall include using
commercially reasonable efforts in the retention and the provision of
documents, records and information that are reasonably relevant to such
requested enforcement action upon reasonable request therefor (subject to the
receiving Party's agreement to appropriate provisions for maintaining
confidentiality and privilege in a manner consistent with Section 6.3 and
Section 6.13).

commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Arion, prior to the Closing,
true, correct and complete copies of all Sphinx Material Contracts that were
not made available to Arion prior to the Agreement Date.

Exhibits. Sphinx shall use commercially reasonable efforts to identify (i) any

not included in Exhibit A thereto prior to the Agreement Date within 30 days
of the Agreement Date, and at the Closing, Exhibit A thereto shall be updated
accordingly, including with applicable Service Periods, (ii) any Internal

and warranties of Arion contained in this Agreement (other than the
Fundamental Representations of Arion) shall have been and be true and correct
(without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality", "material", "in
all material respects" or "Arion Material Adverse Effect", or other
derivations of the word "material" used alone or in a phrase that have a
similar impact or effect, set forth therein) as of the Agreement Date and as
of the Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date (except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date),
other than for such failures to be true and correct (without giving effect to
any limitation as to "materiality", "material", "in all material respects" or
"Arion Material Adverse Effect", or other derivations of the word "material"
used alone or in a phrase that have a similar impact or effect, set forth

Date as though made on the Closing Date (except to the extent expressly made
as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date). Sphinx shall
have received a certificate dated as of the Closing Date and signed on behalf

Section 7.3 Conditions Precedent to Obligation of the Arion Entities. The
obligation of the Arion Entities to consummate and cause the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the
satisfaction (or waiver by Arion) on or prior to the Closing Date of each of

correct as of the Agreement Date and as of the Closing Date as though made on
the Closing Date, other than such failures to be true and correct that would
not have a material and adverse effect on the value of the Business, taken as
a whole (for purposes of clarity, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
words "material and adverse effect on the value of the Business, taken as a
whole" were intentionally chosen to be separate and distinct from the defined
term Sphinx Material Adverse Effect and the parties do not intend or desire
for such definition of Sphinx Material Adverse Effect to apply to the
foregoing); provided that in the event that Arion believes that the condition
set forth in this sentence is not satisfied, Arion shall promptly identify
with reasonable specificity what assets it believes are required to satisfy
such condition and if Sphinx agrees to deliver such identified assets, this
condition shall be deemed satisfied; provided, however, for the avoidance of
doubt, Sphinx may instead dispute that such identified assets are required to
satisfy this condition, and such matter shall be resolved as a dispute
hereunder. Arion shall have received a certificate dated as of the Closing
Date and signed on behalf of Sphinx by an authorized officer of Sphinx to such
effect.

(a) Subject to Section 6.9 relating to Taxes, following the Closing and

(where it is acting as Sphinx) and otherwise as agent for the Other Sphinx
Entities indemnify and hold harmless Arion, its Subsidiaries (including, from
and after the Closing, the Purchased Entities), Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, successors and
assigns (each, an "Arion Indemnified Party" or collectively, the "Arion
Indemnified Parties") from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse
each Arion Indemnified Party for (i) all Losses actually incurred, sustained,
suffered or paid by such Arion Indemnified Party arising out of or as a result
of any Excluded Liabilities, including Sphinx's obligations under Section
6.7(j), and (ii) any amount of Transferred Pension Liabilities, as calculated
in accordance with the principles set forth on Schedule 9.1(a), in excess of
$1,500,000 (such Losses, individually and collectively, the "Arion Losses").
An Arion Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to recover more than once for
the same Arion Loss or the same sets of facts giving rise to such Arion Loss.

(b) Subject to Section 6.9 relating to Taxes, following the Closing and
subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Article 9, Arion shall
indemnify and hold harmless Sphinx, its controlled Affiliates, Subsidiaries
and their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, successors
and assigns (each, a "Sphinx Indemnified Party" or collectively, the "Sphinx
Indemnified Parties") from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse
each Sphinx Indemnified Party for, all Losses actually incurred, sustained,

Sphinx Loss or the same sets of facts giving rise to such Sphinx Loss.

Section 9.2 Certain Limitations.

(a) The representations and warranties of Sphinx and Arion contained in
Article 4 and Article 5, respectively, of this Agreement and in any other
Closing Transfer Document shall not survive and shall expire, terminate and
cease to have any further force or effect upon the consummation of the
Closing. The covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this
Agreement which require performance following the Closing shall survive the
Closing until the date or dates explicitly specified therein or, if not so
specified, until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to the matters contained therein; provided that notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the obligations of Arion and Affiliates with
respect to Assumed Liabilities, and the obligations of Sphinx and its
Subsidiaries with respect to Excluded Liabilities (other than the
indemnification obligations with respect to Excluded Tax Liabilities pursuant
to Section 6.9(a)(i)), shall survive the Closing; provided, further, that the
indemnification obligations with respect to Excluded Tax Liabilities pursuant
to Section 6.9(a)(i) and Liabilities pursuant to Section 6.9(a)



(ii) shall survive the Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable
statutory period of limitations, in each case with respect to the underlying
liabilities of issue. The Parties acknowledge and agree that with respect to
any claim that any Party may have against any other Party that is permitted
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the survival periods set forth and
agreed to in this Section 9.2(a) shall govern when any such claim may be
brought and shall replace and supersede any statute of limitations that may
otherwise be applicable.

(b) For purposes of this Article 9, an Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover special damages from the Indemnifying Party solely to the extent such
special damages are awarded to a third party by a Governmental Authority or
arbitrator in connection with a Third-Party Claim.

(c) If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party
in respect of any Losses pursuant to Section 9.1(a) or Section 9.1(b), as the
case may be, and the Indemnified Party would have recovered all or a part of
such Losses from a third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on the
underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall, to the extent permitted by Law and any pertinent Contract, assign
such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are
necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential
Contributor the amount of such payment; provided that the Indemnified Party
shall not be required to assign any right to proceed against a Potential
Contributor if the Indemnified Party determines in its reasonable discretion
that such assignment would be materially detrimental to its business,
reputation or future business prospects or if such Potential Contributor is a
customer of the Business.

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in no event
will any Arion Indemnified Party have any right to indemnification (and Arion
Losses shall not be deemed to have been incurred) with respect to any matter
to the extent that such matter is accrued or reflected in the calculation of
the Final Cash Consideration pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

Section 9.3 Indemnification Procedures, Third-Party Claims.

(a) General Claim Procedure. Except with respect to Tax Claims which are
addressed in Section 6.9, in respect of any claim regarding indemnification
for any Loss or Liability under this Agreement, the Party making such claim
shall have the burden of proof that such Party is entitled to such
indemnification. In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim
against any Indemnifying Party for indemnification of Losses hereunder, the
Notifying Party shall deliver a notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party
within 20 Business Days of becoming aware of the facts underlying such claim,
stating in reasonable detail the nature and basis of such claim (including, to
the extent such claim relates to a Third-Party Claim, reasonable details of
each claim made by the relevant third party in connection with such Third-
Party Claim and the provision of copies of the relevant material documents
received by the Indemnified Party evidencing such Third-Party Claim), the
amount of the claim (to the extent known or reasonably estimable), the basis
for the indemnification sought and all material documents reflecting or
evidencing the basis for such claim; provided that the failure to provide any
such notice, information or documents will not relieve the Indemnifying Party
of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party or Notifying Party
for indemnification of Losses hereunder, except to the extent that the defense
of such action is actually and materially prejudiced thereby or to the extent
that the amount of Losses for which the Indemnifying Party is responsible is
materially increased thereby.



(b) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Notifying Party that it does not
dispute the claim described in such notice, or fails to notify the Notifying
Party within 30 Business Days after delivery of such notice by the Notifying
Party whether the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim described in such
notice, the Loss in the amount specified in the Notifying Party's notice shall
be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and, subject to
the limitations set forth in this Article 9, the Indemnifying Party shall pay
the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party on demand. If the
Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its Liability with respect to such
claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Notifying Party shall proceed in good
faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through
negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation subject to Section
11.9. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of any such Loss no later than 10
Business Days following the final determination of the Indemnifying Party's
Liability (whether such determination is made pursuant to the procedures set
forth in this Section 9.3, by written agreement between the Indemnifying Party
and the Notifying Party or by final adjudication subject to Section 11.9).

(c) Third-Party Claims.

(i) Within 10 Business Days after the receipt by any Indemnified Party of a
notice of any claim by any third party, or any Proceeding by any third party,
that may be subject to indemnification under this Article 9 (a "Third-Party
Claim"), including any claim or Proceeding relating to any Excluded Liability
or any Assumed Liability, the Notifying Party shall give written notice of
such Third-Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party in accordance with Section
9.3(a) above (the "Third-Party Claim Notice"). Thereafter, the Notifying Party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after any Indemnified
Party's receipt thereof, copies of all material notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party, or filed or
published, relating to the Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the failure to provide any Third-Party Claim Notice or such
other notices or documents described herein will not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party or Notifying
Party for indemnification of Losses hereunder, except to the extent that the
defense of such action is actually prejudiced thereby or to the extent that
the amount of Losses for which the Indemnifying Party is responsible is
increased thereby.

(ii) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof. In
addition, the Indemnifying Party may elect (by written notice to the
Indemnified Party within 45 Business Days after the Indemnifying Party
receives notice of such claim, or at any time thereafter if a diligent and
good faith defense of such claim is not being, or ceases to be, conducted by
the Indemnified Party and such conduct is not remedied within 10 Business Days
after notice in writing to the Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying Party) to
assume and control the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party; provided,
however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to direct such
defense if (A) the Indemnifying Party fails to conduct such defense in a
diligent manner, (B) the Third-Party Claim is in respect of any matter
involving potential criminal liability or seeks as a remedy the imposition of
an equitable remedy that, if granted, would be binding upon the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, (C) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes
an adverse determination with respect to the Third-Party Claim would be
materially detrimental or materially adverse to the Indemnified Party's
reputation or future business prospects or (D) the Indemnified Party has been
advised by counsel that a



reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party (other than as a result of the
operation of this Article 9). Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume
the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
to the Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof for so long as it
continues to direct such defense. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such
defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ, at its own expense, counsel separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the
Indemnifying Party shall control such defense and shall be empowered to make
any settlement with respect to such Third-Party Claim, subject to the terms of
this Section 9.3(c). If and solely to the extent that the underlying Third-
Party Claim is determined to be indemnifiable hereunder, the Indemnifying
Party shall be liable to indemnify the Indemnified Party for any reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party in defense of
such Third-Party Claim for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has
not assumed the defense thereof.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim if the Indemnified
Party is the only Person with actual or potential liability with respect to
the Third-Party Claim and the Indemnified Party irrevocably waives any rights
it may have to indemnification under this Article 9 with respect to such
Third-Party Claim.

(iv) Each of the Parties shall cooperate reasonably, and shall cause their
Subsidiaries to cooperate reasonably, in the defense or prosecution (or
settlement) of any Third-Party Claim against any of them. Such cooperation
shall include using commercially reasonable efforts in (A) the retention and
(upon the reasonable request of an Indemnifying Party or other Party involved
in such claim) the provision of documents, records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim upon reasonable request therefor
(subject to the receiving Party's agreement to appropriate provisions for
maintaining confidentiality and privilege in a manner consistent with Section
6.3 and Section 6.13) and (B) making employees available on any basis
reasonably requested by such Party to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder or otherwise relating to the
Third-Party Claim.

(v) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any Liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the
Indemnifying Party's prior written consent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the Indemnified Party
irrevocably waives its right to indemnification under this Article 9 with
respect to such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may compromise or
settle the same; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall give the
Indemnified Party notice reasonably in advance of any proposed compromise or
settlement and in no event shall the Indemnifying Party compromise or settle
any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, unless such compromise or settlement (i) provides for no relief other
than the payment of monetary damages borne solely by the Indemnifying Party,
(ii) does not include any admission of wrongdoing or violation of Law on the
part of the Indemnified Party or its Subsidiaries and (iii) includes an
unconditional release from all liability or obligation of



the Indemnified Party, its Subsidiaries, Affiliates and their respective
Representatives in respect thereof given by the third party who brought such
Third-Party Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnifying Party shall
have no obligation or right to obtain any settlement, compromise, discharge or
release with respect to any portion of a Third-Party Claim that is not
indemnifiable by the Indemnifying Party hereunder.

(vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of this
Section 9.3 shall not apply to any claim with respect to Taxes, which shall be
governed solely by Section 6.9.

(vii) In the case of any Third-Party Claims where the Indemnifying Party
reasonably believes that it would be appropriate to settle such claim using
equitable remedies (i.e., remedies involving the future activity and conduct
of the Business), the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall work
together in good faith to agree to a settlement; provided, however, that no
Party shall be under any obligation to agree to any such settlement.

Section 9.4 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Any payment made pursuant
to the indemnification obligations arising under this Agreement shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Total Consideration.

Section 9.5 Remedies Exclusive. Following the Closing, with the exception of
(a) the matters covered by Section 3.5 and Section 6.9 and the reimbursement
obligations set forth in Section 2.8, Section 2.9, Section 3.4, Section
6.3(c), Section 6.6(c), Section 6.7(s), Section 6.8, Section 6.15, Section
6.16 and Section 10.3(c) and (b) remedies awarded by a court of competent
jurisdiction based on a judgment that Sphinx or Arion committed actual and
intentional common law fraud with scienter, the indemnification rights and
associated time limits set forth in this Article 9 shall constitute the sole
and exclusive remedy for money damages and shall be in lieu of any other
remedies for money damages that may be available to the Indemnified Parties
under any other agreement or pursuant to any statutory or common Law
(including Environmental Law), whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise,
with respect to any Losses, Liabilities or Proceedings (including legal,
expert and consultant fees and expenses) of any kind or nature incurred
directly or indirectly resulting from or arising out of, under or with respect
to any of this Agreement (including certificates delivered pursuant to Article
7) or the Closing Transfer Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby (it being understood that nothing in this Section 9.5 shall affect
the Parties' rights to specific performance, injunctive relief or other
similar non-monetary equitable remedies with respect to the covenants referred
to in this Agreement to be performed before, at or after the Closing); for
clarity, this Section 9.5 shall not limit the rights and remedies of the
Parties under any of the other Transaction Documents (other than the Closing
Transfer Documents), provided that Section 9.2, shall apply to any
indemnification rights available under any of the other Transaction Documents
and Section 6.9. Sphinx and Arion each hereby waive any provision of any
applicable Law to the extent that it would limit or restrict the agreement
contained in this Section 9.5. Sphinx and Arion hereby irrevocably waive any
right of rescission with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 9.6 No Contribution. In the case of an indemnification claim by an
Arion Indemnified Party against Sphinx pursuant to Section 9.1(a), Sphinx
acknowledges and agrees that neither Sphinx nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
have any right to indemnification or contribution from, or other right or
remedy against, the Purchased Entities or Purchased Minority Interests in
connection with such claim. However, for clarity, to the extent that the
matter underlying such Arion Indemnified Party's indemnification claim would
also entitle a Sphinx Indemnified Party to indemnification against Arion
pursuant to Section 9.1(b), Arion acknowledges and agrees that its assets and
properties (including its ownership interests in the Purchased



Entities and Purchased Minority Interests) will be available to satisfy such
claim if it is resolved in favor of such Sphinx Indemnified Party.

ARTICLE 10 
TERMINATION

Section 10.1 Termination Events. Without prejudice to other remedies which may
be available to the Parties by Law or this Agreement, this Agreement may be
terminated and the transactions contemplated herein may be abandoned:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Parties, if the board of directors (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) of each Party so determines;

(b) after the date that is 12 months following the Agreement Date (the
"Outside Date"), by any Party by notice to the other Party if the Closing
shall not have occurred on or prior to the Outside Date; provided that (x) the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(b) shall not be
available to any Party whose failure to perform any of its obligations under
this Agreement has been the principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of
the Closing to occur on or before such date and (y) the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 10.1(b) shall not be available to the Arion
Entities if, prior to the Outside Date, (i) Arion fails to obtain the full
Required Amount, (ii) Sphinx is otherwise entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1(f) and (iii) Sphinx has provided written notice to
Arion that it has elected to effect the Purchase Transaction pursuant to the
alternative structure referenced in Section 6.16(g) (such notice the,
"Alternative Structure Notice") and is negotiating in good faith with Arion to
make such changes to the organizational and other related documents thereof
necessary to implement such alternative structure; provided, further that,
notwithstanding the foregoing clause (y)(iii), the Arion Entities shall be
entitled to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(b) if the Outside
Date has passed and the Parties fail to consummate the Closing contemplated by
the Alternative Structure Notice previously delivered to Arion within ten
Business Days after Sphinx has provided such notice (unless such failure is a
result of Arion's failure to reasonably cooperate in good faith to make such
necessary changes);

(c) by either Party by notice to the other Party, if (i) a Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a nonappealable final
order, decree or ruling or taken any other nonappealable final action, in each
case having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to occur on the Closing Date; provided that neither Party shall have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(c) if such
Party's failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement has been the
principal cause of, or resulted in, such order, decree or ruling or other
action or (ii) any U.S. federal or state Law has been enacted that would make
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal;

(d) by Sphinx, if there has been a breach of any representation or warranty
set forth in Article 5, or a breach of or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement on the part of Arion set forth in this Agreement, which breach or
failure to perform (i) would cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a)
or Section 7.2(b) not to be satisfied if the date on which such breach or
failure to perform was the Closing Date and (ii) shall not have been cured
within 20 Business Days (or by the Outside Date, if earlier) following receipt
by Arion of written notice of such breach from Sphinx; provided that the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(d) will not be



available to Sphinx if Sphinx is then in breach of, or has failed to perform
with respect to, any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement such that any condition set forth in Section
7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) is incapable of being satisfied;

(e) by Arion, if there has been a breach of any representation or warranty set
forth in Article 4, or a breach of or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement on the part of Sphinx set forth in this Agreement, which breach or
failure to perform (i) would cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a)
or Section 7.3(b) not to be satisfied if the date on which such breach or
failure to perform was the Closing Date and (ii) shall not have been cured
within 20 Business Days (or by the Outside Date, if earlier) following receipt
by Sphinx of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from Arion;
provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
10.1(e) will not be available to Arion if Arion is then in breach of, or has
failed to perform with respect to, any representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement such that any condition set forth in
Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) is incapable of being satisfied; or

(f) by Sphinx, if (i) Arion shall have failed to consummate the Purchase
Transactions within two Business Days after the date on which the Closing
should have occurred pursuant to Section 8.1, (ii) all the conditions set
forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 would have been satisfied if the Closing
were to have occurred at such time (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied on the Closing Date; provided that such conditions
would have been satisfied as of the date on which the Closing should have
occurred pursuant to Section 8.1) and (iii) Sphinx shall have irrevocably
confirmed in writing to Arion at least two Business Days prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(f) (which
confirmation may be given on the date the Closing should have occurred) that
Sphinx stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Purchase Transactions
(subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2); provided that during such period of two Business Days following
the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 8.1, no Party
shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(f)
and Sphinx cooperates with Arion to effect the Closing.

Section 10.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of any termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 10.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
wholly void and of no further force and effect, all further obligations of the
Parties shall terminate and there shall be no Liability on the part of any
Party (or any stockholder, Affiliate, director, officer, employee, agent,
consultant or Representative of such Party) to any other Party (or its
stockholders, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants
or Representatives), except that the Limited Guarantees will survive in
accordance with their respective terms and the provisions of Section 6.3(b),
this Section 10.2, Section 10.3 and Article 11 of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and the Parties shall remain bound by and continue to
be subject to the provisions thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but
subject to Section 10.3, the provisions of this Section 10.2 shall not relieve
either party of any Liability for any material Willful Breach of this
Agreement occurring prior to the termination of this Agreement, or pursuant to
the sections specified in this Section 10.2 to survive such termination;
provided that in no event shall (a) the aggregate amount (whether relating to
any damages, Losses or other Liabilities directly or indirectly incurred or
suffered by any Person) payable by Arion, Arion Opco or any of their
respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries to Sphinx or its Affiliates or
Subsidiaries for breaches or violations of this Agreement exceed $110,000,000
in the aggregate for all such breaches and violations (the "Arion Liability
Limitation") and (b) Sphinx, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or
Representatives, nor will they permit any Person acting on their behalf or
through them to, seek or obtain any monetary recovery or award in excess of
the Arion Liability Limitation for, or with respect to, this Agreement
(including any breach



or termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or any Proceedings under applicable Law arising out of any
such breach, termination or failure).

Section 10.3 Expenses and Termination Fee.

(a) General. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, including in this
(i) this Section 10.3, (ii) the last sentence of each of Section 2.7(b) and
Section 2.7(c) and (iii) Section 2.8, Section 2.9, Section 6.15 and Section
6.16(f), whether or not the Closing occurs, whether or not the Closing occurs,
Sphinx, Arion and Arion Opco shall each pay their respective expenses (such as
legal, investment banker and accounting fees) incurred in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Arion shall pay all filing fees in
connection with filings under the HSR Act and other applicable Antitrust Laws;
provided that, other than the foregoing filing fees, each of Sphinx and Arion
shall bear their own fees, costs or expenses associating with receiving
approval or consent under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws.

(b) Arion Payment. The Arion Entities shall collectively pay to Sphinx (for
Sphinx's own account and as agent for any Other Sphinx Entity) an aggregate
cash amount equal to $110,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") in the event that
this Agreement is terminated (i) by any Party pursuant to Section 10.1(b) if
this Agreement was terminable by Sphinx pursuant to (x) Section 10.1(d) for a
Specified Breach (taking into account, for the avoidance of doubt, any right
to cure such Specified Breach set forth in Section 10.1(d)) or (y) Section
10.1(f), in each case at the time of such termination or (ii) by Sphinx
pursuant to (x) Section 10.1(d) for a Specified Breach or (y) Section 10.1(f).
The Arion Entities shall pay to Sphinx the Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Sphinx promptly but in
no event later than one Business Day after the date of such termination. As
used herein, the term "Specified Breach" means (A) Arion's breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.12 (Financial Capacity),
Section 5.17 (Solvency) (except in the case the primary cause for the breach
of such solvency representation is the financial status of the Purchased
Assets, Assumed Liabilities and the Business transferred to Arion in
connection with the Purchase Transactions) and/or Section 5.18 (Limited
Guarantee) and/or (B) the Arion Entities' breach or failure to perform, on the
part of the Arion Entities, the covenants or agreements set forth in (I)
Section 6.2(a)(y) (Operation of the Business) (but solely with respect to sub-
clauses (i) (ii), (iii), (iv), (vi), (vii), (viii) or (x) thereof) and/or (II)
Section 6.4 (Necessary Efforts; No Inconsistent Action) (provided that, with
respect to the foregoing clause (II), Sphinx shall only be permitted to seek
the Termination Fee as a result of the termination of this Agreement for a
Specified Breach of Section 6.4 of this Agreement on the Outside Date and any
earlier termination of this Agreement as a result of the breach of Arion's
obligations set forth in Section 6.4 of this Agreement shall not entitle
Sphinx to seek or be paid the Termination Fee; provided, further, that for the
avoidance of doubt Sphinx may terminate this Agreement for a Specified Breach
of Section 6.4 of this Agreement prior to the Outside Date and seek damages
for a material Willful Breach thereof to the extent permitted pursuant to
Section 10.2), in each case of clauses (A) and (B) where such Specified Breach
would permit Sphinx to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(d)
(taking into account, for the avoidance of doubt, any right to cure such
Specified Breach set forth in Section 10.1(d)).

(c) Termination Fee Payment. The Parties acknowledge that (i) the agreement
contained in this Section 10.3 is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the amount of, and the basis for payment
of, the fee described herein is reasonable and appropriate in



all respects and (iii) without this agreement, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Arion Entities fail to pay in a
timely manner the Termination Fee and, in order to obtain such payment, Sphinx
makes a claim that results in a judgment for the amount set forth in Section
10.3(b), the Arion Entities shall pay to Sphinx its reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and costs of
counsel) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount
set forth in Section 10.3(b) at the prime rate of J.P. Morgan Chase Bank,
N.A., in effect from time to time from the date such payment was required to
be made hereunder. All payments under Section 10.3(b) or this Section 10.3(c)
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Sphinx.

(d) Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, subject to Sphinx's right to seek specific performance pursuant to,
and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in, Section 11.7, if Arion
fails to effect the Closing when required by Section 8.1 for any or no reason
or otherwise breaches this Agreement in any way (whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) prior to the Closing or fails to
perform hereunder in any way (whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise) prior to the Closing, then, the sole and
exclusive remedy of Sphinx and its Subsidiaries against (i) the Arion Entities
or the Investors, (ii) any Debt Financing Source or prospective lender, lead
arranger, arranger, agent or representative of or to Arion or the Investors
(including the Debt Financing Sources) and (iii) the direct or indirect,
former, current and future holders of any equity, partnership or limited
liability company interest, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, agents, attorneys, Representatives, Affiliates, members, managers,
or assignees of any Person named in clause (i) or (ii) (the Persons described
in clauses (i) through (iii) collectively, the "Arion Related Parties") for
any Losses suffered as a result thereof or any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, any of transactions
contemplated hereby, the Limited Guarantees or the Debt Financing Commitment
shall be (A) the right to terminate this Agreement (subject to the terms of
Section 10.1) and receive payment of the Termination Fee from the Arion
Entities (or the Guarantors in accordance with the Limited Guarantees) (and in
each case, the expenses and interest, if any, contemplated by the second
sentence of Section 10.3(c)) as and to the extent provided by Section 10.3(b)
and Section 10.3(c) or (B) the right of Sphinx to seek to enforce the
obligations of Arion by a decree of specific performance and to seek
temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of the obligations of Arion pursuant to this Agreement as
and only to the extent expressly permitted by Section 11.7; provided that, in
no event shall Sphinx be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance for the consummation of the Closing and the transactions
contemplated hereby and payment of the Termination Fee. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except as set forth in the
preceding sentence, none of the Arion Related Parties will have any Liability
or obligation to Sphinx, its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates,
shareholders, employees, directors, officers or Representatives, relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitment or in respect
of any other agreement, document or theory of law or equity, through Arion or
otherwise whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by
or through a claim by or on behalf of Arion, Arion Opco or against any other
Arion Related Party, by the enforcement of any assessment by any legal or
equitable Proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable
Law or otherwise. Without limiting the foregoing, upon termination of this
Agreement by Sphinx and the payment of the Termination Fee, none of the Arion
Related Parties shall have any further Liability or other obligation to Sphinx
or any of its Subsidiaries relating or arising out of this Agreement, the
Limited Guarantee, the Debt Financing Commitment or in respect of any of the
other Transaction Documents or any transactions contemplated herein or
therein.

with the provisions of all applicable Laws relating to bulk transfers in
connection with the Transfer of the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Assets.

Section 11.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be
declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or
unenforceable, all other provisions of this Agreement and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances other than those which it is
determined to be illegal, void or unenforceable, shall not be impaired or
otherwise affected and shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, and Sphinx and Arion shall negotiate in
good faith to replace such illegal, void or unenforceable provision with a
provision that corresponds as closely as possible to the intentions of the
Parties as expressed by such illegal, void or unenforceable provision.

Section 11.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which
together shall be deemed to be one and the same



instrument. Copies of executed counterparts transmitted by telecopy, .pdf,

executed counterparts for purposes of this Section 11.4. Once this Agreement
is signed, any reproduction of this Agreement made by reliable means (for
example, photocopy or facsimile) is considered an original, to the extent
permissible under applicable Law.

Section 11.5 Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall not
be assigned by any Party without the prior written consent of the other
Parties, and any attempted assignment, without such consent, shall be null and
void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of Sphinx, each of
Arion and Arion Opco may assign its rights or obligations hereunder (a) to any
Other Arion Entity (including the right to purchase any of the Purchased
Assets or Purchased Shares and the obligation to assume all or part of the
Assumed Liabilities, as the case may be, in which event all references herein
to Arion or Arion Opco will be deemed to refer to such Other Arion Entity, as
appropriate), (b) to any Person that acquires substantially all of the assets
or a majority of the equity interests of Arion or Arion Opco following the
Closing or (c) to any parties providing the Debt Financing for purposes of
creating a security interest herein or otherwise assign as collateral in
respect of such Debt Financing; provided that no such assignment shall limit
or affect the obligations of Arion or Arion Opco hereunder. Subject to the
foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any Person other than the Arion Entities, Sphinx or their successors or
permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement; provided, that the Debt Financing Sources shall be express third
party beneficiaries of and shall be entitled to rely upon Section 10.3(d), the
last sentence of Section 11.6, Section 11.7, the proviso in Section 11.8,
Section 11.9, Section 11.12, Section 11.13, Section 11.14 and this Section
11.5, and each Debt Financing Source may enforce such provisions.

Section 11.6 Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified only by a written instrument executed by the Parties. No
waiver by any Party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless
explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the Party so waiving. Except
as provided in the preceding sentence, no action taken pursuant to this
Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any Party, or a
failure or delay by any Party in exercising any power, right or privilege
under this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party
taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained herein, or in any documents delivered or to
be delivered pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the Closing
hereunder. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision of this
Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
breach. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Section
10.3(d), Section 11.5, the proviso in Section 11.8, Section 11.9, Section
11.12, Section 11.13, Section 11.14 and this Section 11.6 (and the defined
terms therein and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment,
modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the
substance of Section 10.3(d), Section 11.5, the proviso in Section 11.8,
Section 11.9, Section 11.12, Section 11.13, Section 11.14 and this Section
11.6) may not be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a manner that
adversely impacts in any respect the Debt Financing Sources without the prior
written consent of the Debt Financing Sources.

Section 11.7 Specific Performance; Remedies. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement was not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof or were otherwise breached and
that the Parties shall be entitled (without the requirement to post a bond or
other security) to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches and
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at Law or in equity. The Parties agree not to assert that a
remedy of injunctive relief, specific performance or other equitable relief is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason,



nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate
remedy. The Parties agree that, notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Sphinx shall only be entitled to seek or obtain any injunction,
specific performance or any other equitable relief requiring Arion or Arion
Opco to cause the Arion Entities to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including to effect the Closing in accordance with Section 8.1, on the
terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement, if and only if: (i)
this Agreement has not been validly terminated in accordance with Section
10.1, (ii) all conditions in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3 have been satisfied
as of the date on which the Closing would otherwise be required to occur
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied on the
Closing Date, provided that such conditions will be satisfied as of the
Closing Date if the Closing were to occur), (iii) Arion fails to complete the
Closing by the date the Closing would otherwise be required to have occurred
pursuant to Section 8.1, (iv) the Debt Financing (or alternative financing in
accordance with, and satisfies the conditions of, Section 6.16) has been
funded or would be funded (or, if such Debt Financing has been funded into
escrow, such funds have been or will be released from escrow at the Closing)
if the Closing were to occur and (v) Sphinx has irrevocably confirmed in
writing to Arion that Sphinx is prepared, able and would take such actions
required of it by this Agreement to effect the Closing upon the funding of the
Debt Financing. The election of Sphinx to pursue an injunction or specific
performance shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit Sphinx from
subsequently seeking to terminate this Agreement and seeking to collect the
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 10.3(b); provided, however, that under no
circumstances shall Sphinx be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance resulting in the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to this Section 11.7 and the payment of the
Termination Fee. In the event that Sphinx elects to concurrently pursue a
remedy of specific performance for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and a remedy for money damages against the
Arion Entities (including payment of the Termination Fee), Arion shall be
entitled, at Arion's sole election, to settle any pre-Closing claims against
the Arion Entities relating to their obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by consummating the Closing in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to the entry of any
judgement or award for damages to Sphinx.

Section 11.8 Governing Law. This Agreement and all claims and Proceedings
arising out of this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the internal Laws of the State of Delaware (whether arising
in contract, tort, equity or otherwise), without regard to any conflicts or
choice of law principles that would result in the application of any Law other
than the Law of the State of Delaware; provided that notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such disputes involving the Debt Financing Sources will be
governed by, construed in accordance with, and enforced under the applicable
Laws of the State of New York without giving regard to conflicts or choice of
law principles that would result in the application of any Law other than the
Law of the State of New York.

Section 11.9 Consent to Jurisdiction. The Parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any Federal court of the United States of America located within
the State of Delaware, solely with respect to any and all claims and
Proceedings related to this Agreement and the interpretation and enforcement
of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(including resolution of disputes under Article 9 hereof), and, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense
in any action, suit or other Proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement
hereof or thereof, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or
other Proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or
that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any
such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties
irrevocably and unconditionally agree that all claims with respect to such
action, suit or other Proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a
Delaware State or, to the extent permitted by Law, Federal court. The Parties
hereby consent to and



grant any such court jurisdiction over the Person of such Parties and over the
subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such action, suit or Proceeding in the manner
provided for notices in Section 11.1 or in such other manner as may be
permitted by applicable Law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.
The Parties further agree, to the extent permitted by Law, that final and non-
appealable judgment against a party in any action or Proceeding contemplated
above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within
or outside the United States by suit on the judgment, a certified or
exemplified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount
of such judgment. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not bring or support
the bringing of any Proceeding, action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in Law or in equity,
whether arising in contract, tort, equity or otherwise, against the Debt
Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitment or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is
vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof).

Section 11.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Sphinx Disclosure Letter, the
Arion Disclosure Letter and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto set forth the
entire agreement and understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, representations or warranties relating to such subject matter.
In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and
any Closing Transfer Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.

Section 11.11 No Joint Venture on the Agreement Date. This Agreement does not
authorize any Party (a) to bind or commit, or to act as an agent, employee or
legal representative of, another Party, except as may be specifically set
forth in other provisions of this Agreement or (b) to have the power to
control the activities and operations of another Party. The Parties are
independent contractors with respect to each other under this Agreement. Each
Party agrees not to hold itself out as having any authority or relationship
contrary to this Section 11.11.

Section 11.12 LIMITATION ON LIABILITY. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT
WILL ANY PARTY HERETO, OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCES,
BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL (OTHER THAN ARISING BY REASON
OF OR RESULTING FROM EFFORTS TO MITIGATE LOSSES), EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING DIMINUTIONS OR REDUCTIONS IN VALUE, LOST
PROFITS, LOST OPPORTUNITIES, THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH ANY EQUITABLE
REMEDIES OR CHANGES IN BUSINESS PRACTICES, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOST SALES OR
OTHER SPECULATIVE DAMAGES) IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIMS, LOSSES, DAMAGES OR
INJURIES ARISING OUT OF ANY BREACH BY SUCH PARTY OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY
FAILURE OF SUCH PARTY TO PERFORM ITS OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER SUCH BREACHING OR NONPERFORMING PARTY WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES OR NOT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING,
NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT A PERSON'S ABILITY TO RECOVER ANY LOSSES IN RESPECT
OF SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
TO THE EXTENT AWARDED TO A THIRD PARTY BY A GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY OR
ARBITRATOR IN CONNECTION WITH A THIRD-PARTY CLAIM.



Section 11.13 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE) ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT FINANCING
COMMITMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR THEREOF (INCLUDING ANY
PROCEEDING INVOLVING THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCES UNDER THE DEBT FINANCING
COMMITMENT). THE PARTIES HEREBY FURTHER IRREVOCABLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR
OTHERWISE) BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY AGAINST THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCES IN ANY
MATTER WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN RELATION TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE DEBT FINANCING COMMITMENT OR THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

Section 11.14 Non-Recourse. Subject to the rights of Arion under the Debt
Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements relating thereto, in each
case under the terms thereof, none of the Debt Financing Sources shall have
any Liability for any obligations or Liabilities of any Party under this
Agreement or for any claim (whether arising in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of (or in any way relating
to), the transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitment, the transactions
contemplated thereby or the performance thereof and the Parties agree not to
assert any such claim or bring any action, suit or other Proceeding in
connection with any such claim against any Debt Financing Sources.

Section 11.15 Retention of Counsel. Each of Arion and Arion Opco, for itself
and, following the Closing, the Purchased Entities, and for Arion's and Arion
Opco's and, following the Closing, the Purchased Entities' respective
successors and assigns, irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all
communications between Sphinx and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and legal
counsel, on the other hand, including Fenwick and West LLP, made in connection
with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or
any dispute or Proceeding arising under or in connection with, this Agreement
which, immediately prior to the Closing, would be deemed to be privileged
communications of Sphinx or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Purchased
Entities) and their counsel and would not be subject to disclosure to Arion or
Arion Opco in connection with any process relating to a dispute arising under
or in connection with this Agreement or otherwise, shall continue after the
Closing to be privileged communications between Sphinx and such counsel, and
none of Arion, Arion Opco or any Person, acting or purporting to act on behalf
of or through Arion or Arion Opco shall seek to obtain the same by any process
on the grounds that the privilege attaching to such communications belongs to
the Purchased Entities and not to Sphinx. Each of Arion, Arion Opco and the
Purchased Entities agree that any attorney-client privilege, attorney work-
product protection, and expectation of client confidence arising from or as a
result of counsel's representation of an Purchased Entity or Sphinx prior to
the Closing, and all information and documents covered by such privilege or
protection, shall belong to and be controlled by Sphinx and may be waived only
by Sphinx, and not a Purchased Entity, and shall not pass to or be claimed or
used by Arion, Arion Opco or any Purchased Entity, except with respect to the
assertion of such privilege or protection against a third party.

Section 11.16 Rules of Construction.

(a) The Parties have been represented by counsel during the negotiation,
preparation and execution of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and, therefore, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement, any

or in this Appendix F, cash and cash equivalents used in the calculation of
Business Cash shall be determined in accordance with GAAP.



| 
---|--- 

B.

Methodologies for Calculating Closing Net Working Capital. 

 

The account balances comprising Closing Net Working Capital shall be derived
from the Unaudited Non-GAAP Combined Statement of Net Operating Assets of the
Business as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet"). Unless otherwise specifically
provided for in this Appendix F, the Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared
using only the same accounting methods, policies, practices, principles and
procedures (with consistent classifications), judgments and estimation
methodologies as were used in the preparation of the Unaudited Non-GAAP
Combined Statement of Net Operating Assets as of March 31, 2017 included in
Schedule 4.11(a) of the Agreement (the "Past Practices").



The Closing Balance Sheet shall entirely disregard (i) any and all effects on
the assets or liabilities of the Parties and their Subsidiaries as a result of
(A) the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and the Transaction
Documents, (B) any financing or refinancing arrangements entered into (i) at
any time by any of the Parties and/or their respective Affiliates or (ii) by
the Parties at the Closing pursuant to the terms of the Agreement or (C) any
other transaction entered into by any of the Parties and/or their respective
Affiliates in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents. Valuations and estimates for the
Closing Balance Sheet shall not reflect or take into account developments
between the date thereof and the date of preparation of the Closing Balance
Sheet except for those developments that provide additional evidence with
respect to conditions that existed on the date of the Closing Balance Sheet
(but without taking into account any of the Purchased Transactions to occur on
the Closing Date).



Notwithstanding anything to contrary provided for this in the Agreement or
this Appendix F, the following accounting methods and provisions will be
utilized for purposes of preparing and determining the Closing Balance Sheet,
regardless of whether or not such accounting methods and provisions are
consistent with, and in accordance with, the Past Practices.

shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and consistent with the
methodologies described in Schedule 4.11.

Accrued Paid Time Off ("PTO") - Accrued PTO for Continuing Employees shall be

---|--- 

(iii)

|

Accrued Bonus - Employee incentive compensation and bonus accruals reflected
on the Closing Balance Sheet shall equal the annual budgeted bonus amount,
which assumes payment of 100% of the bonus target, divided by 365 days
multiplied by the number of days from April 1, 2017 to the date of the Closing
Balance Sheet, less any payments made prior to the date of the Closing Balance
Sheet in respect of incentive compensation and bonuses for fiscal year 2018.

|

Purchase Accounting Adjustments - Any purchase accounting adjustments required
under GAAP that result from the transactions contemplated by the Agreement

governing such commissions and the underlying commission agreements for each
respective employee through the close of business on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(vi)

|

Accrued payroll, payroll taxes and benefits - Payroll, payroll taxes and
benefits for costs incurred but not yet paid shall be accrued on a daily pro
rata basis based on the total number of days since the last payroll, payroll
tax and benefits payments through the close of business on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date based on each respective Continuing Employee's
individual compensation arrangement, the applicable tax rates and applicable
benefit costs incurred. 

 

|

Purchased Entities' Closing Net Working Capital Balances - To the extent not
addressed in Appendix F, the components of Closing Net Working Capital

with the same accounting methods, policies, practices, principles and
procedures (with consistent classifications), judgments and estimation
methodologies as were used historically in the respective balance sheet of
each Purchased Entity as of March 31, 2017. Intercompany receivables and
payables will be excluded from the Closing Net Working Capital attributable to
Purchased Entities. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(viii)
