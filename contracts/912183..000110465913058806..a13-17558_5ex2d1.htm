 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

 **THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER** (" ** _Agreement_** ") is made and
entered into as of July 30, 2013, by and among: **Cubist Pharmaceuticals,
Inc.**, a Delaware corporation (" ** _Parent_** "); **BRGO Corporation** , a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" **
_Purchaser_** "); and **Trius Therapeutics, Inc.**, a Delaware corporation
(the " ** _Company_** "). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are
defined in **Exhibit A**.

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

A. Parent has agreed to cause Purchaser to commence a cash tender offer (as it
may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " **
_Offer_** ") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(the " ** _Shares_** ") for (a) $13.50 per share, net to the seller in cash
(the " ** _Closing Amount_** "), without interest, plus one contingent value
right per share (a " ** _CVR_** ") which shall represent the right to receive
the Payment Amounts (as such term is used in the Contingent Value Rights
Agreement in the form attached hereto as **Annex III** (the " ** _CVR
Agreement_** ") to be entered into between Parent and a trustee mutually
agreeable to Parent and the Company (the " ** _Trustee_** "), if any, at the
times provided for in the CVR Agreement, without interest (the Closing Amount
plus one CVR, collectively, or any higher amount per share paid pursuant to
the Offer, being the " ** _Offer Price_** ").

 



 

B. Following the consummation of the Offer, upon the terms and conditions set
forth herein, Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company (the " **
_Merger_** "), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the
merger (the " ** _Surviving Corporation_** "), on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby, except as expressly provided
in Section 2.5, (i) each issued and outstanding Share not owned by Parent,
Purchaser or the Company as of the Effective Time shall be converted into the
right to receive the Offer Price, in cash, without interest, and (ii) the
Company shall become a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent as a result of the
Merger.

 



 

C. The Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that this
Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, are
advisable to, and in the best interest of, the Company and its stockholders,
(ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Offer and
the Merger, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the
Company tender their shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer, and, if
applicable, adopt this Agreement (the " ** _Company Board Recommendation_**
").

 



 

D. The Board of Directors of each of Parent and Purchaser have approved this
Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Purchaser, respectively, to
enter into this Agreement.

 



 

E. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent and Purchaser entering into this Agreement,
certain holders

      
 

 



 

of the Shares (the " ** _Principal Stockholders_** ") have entered into tender
and voting agreements, dated as of the date hereof, in substantially the form
set forth in **Annex II** , pursuant to which, among other things, each of the
Principal Stockholders has agreed to tender his, her or its Shares to
Purchaser in the Offer (the " ** _Tender and Voting Agreements_** ").

 



 

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

The Parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 



 

 **SECTION 1.** ** ****THE OFFER**

 



 

 **1.1** ** ****The Offer**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** ****Commencement of the Offer**. Provided that this Agreement
shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 8, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement but in no event more than ten
(10) business days after the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act) the Offer.

 



 

 **(b)** ** ****Terms and Conditions of the Offer**. The obligations of
Purchaser to, and of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, and pay
for, any Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the prior satisfaction of
the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions
set forth in **Annex I** (collectively, the " ** _Offer Conditions_** "). The
Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " ** _Offer to
Purchase_** ") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, including
the Minimum Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser expressly
reserves the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer
Condition and (iii) make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the
Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; _provided, however,_
that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement, without the prior written
consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (A) decrease the Closing Amount or
amend the terms of the CVR or the CVR Agreement, (B) change the form of the
consideration payable in the Offer, (C) decrease the maximum number of Shares
sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose conditions or requirements to
the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend or modify any of the
Offer Conditions in a manner that adversely affects any holder of Shares in
its capacity as such, (F) change or waive the Minimum Condition, or (G) extend
or otherwise change the Expiration Date in a manner other than as required or
permitted by this Agreement. The Offer may not be withdrawn prior to the
Expiration Date (or any rescheduled Expiration Date) of the Offer, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.

 



 

 **(c)** ** ****Expiration and Extension of the Offer**. The Offer shall
initially be scheduled to expire on the date that is twenty-one (21) business
days following the Offer Commencement Date (determined as set forth in Rule
14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) at 9:00 a.m. Eastern
Time (the " ** _Initial Expiration Date_** _,_ " such date or such

 



      
 

 



 

subsequent date to which the expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, the " ** _Expiration Date_** ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to the Parties respective termination rights under Section 8: (i) if,
as of the scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and
has not been waived, Purchaser may, in its discretion (and without the consent
of the Company or any other Person), extend the Offer on one or more
occasions, for an additional period of up to ten (10) business days per
extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; (ii) Purchaser
shall extend the Offer from time to time for: (A) any period required by any
Legal Requirement applicable to the Offer; and (B) periods of up to ten (10)
business days per extension, until any waiting period (and any extension
thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Offer under the HSR Act and any
foreign antitrust or competition-related Legal Requirement shall have expired
or been terminated; and (iii) if, as of the scheduled Expiration Date, any
Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, at the request of
the Company, Purchaser shall extend the Offer on one or more occasions for an
additional period of up to ten (10) business days per extension, to permit
such Offer Condition to be satisfied; _provided_ that the Company can only
request one (1) such extension in the event the Minimum Condition has not been
satisfied; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall Purchaser: (1) be
required to extend the Offer beyond the earliest to occur of (x) the valid
termination of this Agreement in compliance with Section 8 and (y) the first
business day immediately following the End Date (such earlier occurrence, the
" ** _Extension Deadline_** "); or (2) be permitted to extend the Offer beyond
the Extension Deadline without the prior written consent of the Company.
Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date
without the prior written consent of the Company except in the event that this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, if, as of the scheduled Expiration Date, all of the Offer
Conditions are satisfied or waived, but there shall not have been validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that number of Shares
necessary to permit the Merger to be effected without a meeting of the
Companys stockholders, Purchaser may provide a "subsequent offering period"
in accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

 **(d)** ** ****Termination of Offer**. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) promptly (and, in any event, within two (2) business days of
such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and
shall not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated
or withdrawn by Purchaser, Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause
any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof.

 



 

 **(e)** ** ****Offer Documents**. As promptly as practicable on the date of
commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act), Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer
statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " **
_Schedule TO_** ") that will contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to
Purchase and form of the related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the
Offer to Purchase and related documents to

 



      
 

 



 

be disseminated to holders of Shares. Parent and Purchaser agree that they
shall cause the Schedule TO and all exhibits, amendments or supplements
thereto (which together constitute the " ** _Offer Documents_** ") filed by
either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC to comply in all material respects
with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other
applicable Legal Requirements. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect, and Parent further agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company shall
promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and Purchaser or
Parents legal counsel all information concerning the Company and the
Companys stockholders that may be required in connection with any action
contemplated by this Section 1.1(e). The Company and its counsel shall be
given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser agree to
provide the Company and its counsel with any comments Parent, Purchaser or
their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments. Each of Parent and
Purchaser shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer.

 



 

 **(f)** ** ****Funds**. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.10 and
subject to Section 8, Parent shall cause to be provided to Purchaser all of
the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a
timely basis, all of Purchasers obligations under this Agreement. Parent and
Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and Purchaser shall ensure that all of
their respective Affiliates shall, tender any Shares held by them into the
Offer.

 



 

 **(g)** ** ****CVR Agreement**. Parent and the Trustee shall, at or prior to
the Offer Acceptance Time, duly authorize, execute and deliver the CVR
Agreement.

 



 

 **1.2** ** ****Company Actions**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** ****Schedule 14D-9**. As promptly as practicable on the day that
the Offer is commenced, following the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company
shall file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, a Tender
Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with
any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " ** _Schedule 14D-9_**
") that, subject to Section 6.1(b), shall reflect the Company Board
Recommendation. The Company agrees that it will cause the Schedule 14D-9 to
comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable
Legal Requirements. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as

 



      
 

 



 

and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and
its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment thereto prior to the filing thereof with the
SEC. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel with any comments
the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments. The Company
shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9.

 



 

 **(b)** ** ****Stockholder Lists**. The Company shall promptly furnish Parent
with a list of its stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or
computer file containing the names and addresses of all record holders of
Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories,
in each case accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date, and
shall provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists
of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such
other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the Offer
and the Merger. Parent and Purchaser and their agents shall hold in confidence
the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use
such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver, and shall use
their reasonable efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the Company (or
destroy) all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then
in their possession or control.

 



 

 **1.3** ** ****Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders**. In the event that
Purchaser has acquired at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares
of each class of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote on the Merger,
pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, the Parties hereto agree, at the request
of Parent, to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to
become effective as soon as practicable after such acquisition, without a
meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in accordance with and subject to
the DGCL.

 



 

 **1.4** ** ****Directors.**

 



 

 **(a)** ** **Upon the Offer Acceptance Time, and from time to time
thereafter, Purchaser will be entitled to designate such number of directors,
rounded up to the next whole number, on the Board of Directors of the Company
as will give Purchaser representation on the Board of Directors of the Company
equal to the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Board of
Directors of the Company (after giving effect to any increase in the number of
directors pursuant to this Section 1.4) and (ii) the percentage that such
number of Shares so purchased bears to the total number of then-outstanding
Shares on a fully-diluted basis, and the Company will, upon request by
Purchaser, promptly increase the size of the Board of Directors of the Company
or use commercially reasonable efforts to seek the resignations of such number
of directors as is necessary to provide Purchaser with such level of
representation and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
Purchasers designees to be so elected or appointed. Subject to the applicable
requirements of NASDAQ, the Company will also use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause individuals designated by Purchaser to constitute the same
percentage of each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company as the
percentage of the entire

 



       
 

 



 

Board of Directors of the Company represented by individuals designated by
Purchaser. The Companys obligations to appoint designees to the Board of
Directors of the Company will be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act.
At the request of Purchaser, the Company will file with the SEC and mail to
the holders of Shares the information required by Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. Parent and Purchaser will
supply to the Company all information with respect to themselves and their
respective officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, and Parent and Purchaser
will be solely responsible for such information. For purposes of this
Agreement, such information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder that is filed with the SEC and mailed to
holders of Shares will be considered part of the Schedule 14D-9.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.4, the Company,
Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Board of Directors of the Company to
include, at all times prior to the Effective Time, at least three of the
members of the Board of Directors of the Company, selected by the members of
the Board of Directors of the Company, who were directors of the Company on
the date of this Agreement (" ** _Continuing Directors_** "), each of whom
shall be an "independent director" as defined by Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq
Marketplace Rules and eligible to serve on the Companys audit committee under
the Exchange Act and the applicable requirements of NASDAQ; provided, however,
that if at any time prior to the Effective Time there shall be fewer than
three (3) Continuing Directors serving as directors of the Company for any
reason, then the Board of Directors of the Company shall take all necessary
action (including creating a committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company) to cause an individual selected by the remaining Continuing Directors
(or Continuing Director, if there shall be only one (1) Continuing Director
remaining) who satisfies the foregoing independence requirements and who is
not an officer, director, stockholder or designee of Parent or any of its
Affiliates to be appointed to serve on the Board of Directors of the Company
(and such individual shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for all
purposes under this Agreement).

 



 

 **(c)** ** **Following the election or appointment of Purchasers designees
pursuant to Section 1.4(a) and prior to the Effective Time, any action by the
Company with respect to any amendment, supplement, modification, or waiver of
any term of this Agreement, any termination of this Agreement by the Company,
any extension of time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of Parent or Purchaser under this Agreement, any waiver of compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions under this Agreement that are for the
benefit of the Company, any amendment to the Companys certificate of
incorporation or bylaws, any authorization of an agreement between the Company
and any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent, Purchaser or any of
their Affiliates, on the other hand, any exercise of the Companys rights or
remedies under this Agreement and any action to seek to enforce any obligation
of Parent or Purchaser under this Agreement (or any other action by the Board
of Directors of the Company with respect to this Agreement, the Offer or the
Merger if such other action adversely affects, or could reasonably be expected
to adversely affect, any of the holders of Shares other than Parent or
Purchaser) may only be authorized by, and will require the

 



      
 

 



 

authorization of, a majority of the Continuing Directors (or by the Continuing
Director should there be only one). For purposes of considering any matter set
forth in this Section 1.4(c), the Continuing Directors will be permitted to
meet without the presence of the other directors. The Continuing Directors
will have the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current
counsel to the Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as
determined by the Continuing Directors and will have the authority to
institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this
Agreement or any of the Companys rights hereunder. The Company will indemnify
and advance expenses to, and Parent will cause the Company to indemnify and
advance expenses to, the Continuing Directors in connection with their service
as directors of the Company prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirement and in accordance with the
provisions of Section 6.5 hereof.

 



 

 **(d)** ** **In the event that Purchasers designees are elected or appointed
to the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to Section 1.4(a), until the
Effective Time, (i) the Board of Directors of the Company will have at least
such number of directors as may be required by the NASDAQ rules or the federal
securities Legal Requirements who are considered independent directors within
the meaning of such rules and Legal Requirements (" ** _Independent
Directors_** ") and (ii) each committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company that is required (or a majority of which is required) by the NASDAQ
rules or the federal securities Legal Requirements to be composed solely of
Independent Directors will be so composed; _provided_ , _however_ , if the
number of Independent Directors is reduced below the number of directors as
may be required by such rules or Legal Requirements for any reason, the
remaining Independent Director(s) will be entitled to designate persons to
fill such vacancies who will be deemed to be Independent Directors for
purposes of this Agreement or, if no Independent Director then remains, the
other directors will designate such number of directors as may be required by
the NASDAQ rules and the federal securities Legal Requirements to fill such
vacancies who will not be shareholders or Affiliates of Parent or Purchaser,
and such Persons will be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of
this Agreement.

 



 

 **1.5** ** ****Top-Up Option.**

 



 

 **(a)** ** **The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option
(the " ** _Top-Up Option_** "), exercisable only on the terms and conditions
set forth in this Section 1.5, to purchase at a price per share equal to the
greater of (i) the last reported sale price of a Share on NASDAQ on the last
trading day prior to the date on which the Top-Up Option is exercised or (ii)
the Closing Amount, newly issued Shares (the " ** _Top-Up Shares_** ") so
that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Purchaser prior to the
exercise of the Top-Up Option, Purchaser will own at least ninety percent
(90%) of the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the Company
entitled to vote on the Merger immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up
Shares (not including in the Shares owned by Purchaser any Shares tendered
pursuant to unfulfilled guaranteed delivery procedures); _provided, however_ ,
that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for the number of Shares in
excess of the authorized and unissued Shares less the maximum number of Shares
potentially necessary for issuance with respect to Company Equity Plan Awards
or other obligations of the Company. The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable
once

 



      
 

 



 

at any time following the Offer Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier to
occur of (A) the Effective Time and (B) the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms; _provided, however,_ that the obligation of the
Company to deliver Top-Up Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is
subject to the condition that (i) immediately following the exercise of the
Top-Up Option, the number of Shares owned in the aggregate by Parent and
Purchaser constitutes at least one share more than 90% of the number of the
outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the Company entitled to
vote on the Merger immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares (not
including in the Shares owned by Purchaser any Shares tendered pursuant to
unfulfilled guaranteed delivery procedures) and (ii) the Minimum Condition
shall have been satisfied. Purchaser may assign the Top-Up Option and its
rights and obligations pursuant to this Section 1.5, in its sole discretion,
to Parent.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and
delivery of the Top-Up Shares comply with all applicable Legal Requirements,
including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration under the
Securities Act. If Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Purchaser
shall give the Company written notice, specifying (i) the number of Shares
owned by Purchaser and (ii) a place and a time for the closing of such
purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such
notice, deliver written notice to Purchaser specifying, based on the
information provided by Purchaser in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares.
Prior to the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, upon Purchasers
request, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to
Purchaser the number of Shares issued and outstanding (A) as of immediately
prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and (B) after giving effect to the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares.

 



 

 **(c)** ** **The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Shares may
be paid, at Purchasers option, (i) in cash, (ii) by executing and delivering
to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the
balance of the remaining aggregate purchase price, or (iii) a combination
thereof, provided that Purchaser shall use cash for at least the aggregate par
value of the Top-Up Shares. The Board of Directors of the Company has approved
such consideration for the Top-Up Shares. Any such promissory note shall
include the following terms: (1) the maturity date shall be one (1) year after
issuance, (2) the unpaid principal amount of the promissory note shall accrue
simple interest at a per annum rate of one percent (1.00%) and (3) the
promissory note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, without
penalty or prior notice.

 



 

 **(d)** ** **At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, Purchaser
shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration required to be
delivered in exchange for such Top-Up Shares, and the Company shall cause such
Top-Up Shares to be issued to Purchaser via book-entry delivery.

 



 

 **(e)** ** **Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares that
Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that Purchaser is,

 



      
 

 



 

and will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "Accredited Investor,"
as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act.

 



 

 **SECTION 2.** ** ****MERGER TRANSACTION**

 



 

 **2.1** ** ****Merger of Purchaser into the Company**. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
the Company and Parent shall consummate the Merger, whereby Purchaser shall be
merged with and into the Company, and the separate existence of Purchaser
shall cease. The Company will continue as the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

 **2.2** ** ****Effect of the Merger**. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 **(a)** ** **Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to
Section 8, and unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company, Parent and Purchaser, the consummation of the Merger (the " **
_Closing_** ") shall take place at the offices of Cooley LLP, 4401 Eastgate
Mall, San Diego, CA 92121, at 9:05 a.m. Eastern Time on a date specified by
the Parties, which shall be no later than the second (2nd) business day after

"

 



 

 **(b)** ** **Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as
practicable on the Closing Date, the Company and Purchaser shall file or cause
to be filed a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware with respect to the Merger, in such form as required by, and
executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the date and time of the filing
of such certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or such later date and time as is agreed upon in writing by the
parties hereto and specified in the certificate of merger (such date and time,
the " ** _Effective Time_** ").

 



 

 **2.4** ** ****Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and
Officers**. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:

 



 

 **(a)** ** **the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to Exhibit
B;

 



 

 **(b)** ** **the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the Bylaws of Purchaser as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

 



      
 

 



 

 **(c)** ** **the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation

are directors and officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 



 

 **2.5** ** ****Conversion of Shares**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** **At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any
stockholder of the Company:

 



 

 **(i)** ** **any Shares then held by the Company (or held in the Companys
treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 



 

 **(ii)** ** **any Shares then held by Parent, Purchaser or any other wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 



 

 **(iii)** ** **except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and
subject to Section 2.5(b), each Share then outstanding (other than any
Dissenting Shares, as defined below) shall be converted into the right to
receive the (i) the Closing Amount, payable to the holder thereof in cash,
without interest, plus (ii) one CVR, or any such higher consideration as may
be paid in the Offer (the " ** _Merger Consideration_** "), subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Legal Requirements in accordance
with Section 2.6(e); and

 



 

 **(iv)** ** **each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
Purchaser then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock

 **(b)** ** **If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares
by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted.

 



 

 **2.6** ** ****Surrender of Certificates; Payment of Non-Employee Options;
Stock Transfer Books**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** **Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " **
_Paying Agent_** ") for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to
receive the aggregate Closing Amounts to which holders of such Shares shall
become entitled pursuant to Section 2.5 and for holders of Company Options who
received such Company Options other than through employment by the Company or
who are former employees of the Company who cannot be paid through the
Companys payroll (the " ** _Non-Employee Optionees_** ") to receive the
aggregate Closing Amounts to which the Non-

 



      
 

 



 

Employee Optionees become entitled pursuant to Section 2.8. At or prior to the
Effective Time (subject to Section 2.8(b)), Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Closing Amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.5 and to the Non-
Employee Optionees pursuant to Section 2.8 (the **_"Payment Fund_** "). The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall
be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation;
_provided_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or
in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category
granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a
combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall
have a maturity exceeding three (3) months.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than
five (5) business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to
be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
the shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5 or was, at the Effective Time, a Non-
Employee Optionee entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.8 a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in reasonable and
customary form and shall, with respect to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.5, specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the certificates evidencing such shares (the " ** _Certificates_** ") shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or in accordance with
Section 2.6(f), if applicable) to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant
to such letter of transmittal. With respect to any holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.5, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or in
accordance with Section 2.6(f), if applicable) or Book-Entry Shares, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the
Merger Consideration payable with respect to the Non-Employee Options or
payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the
benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificates formerly evidencing the shares of Company Common Stock is
registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the

 



      
 

 



 

Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
applicable. None of Parent, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall have
any liability for the transfer and other similar Taxes described in this
Section 2.6(b) under any circumstance. Payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

 



 

 **(c)** ** **At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any funds (with respect to the Closing Amount) which had been
made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or Non-Employee Optionees (including, all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds
made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look
to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other
similar Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with respect to
the Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them or with respect to their
Company Options. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving
Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares or Non-Employee Optionee for the Merger Consideration
delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body shall become,
to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the property of the
Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

 **(d)** ** **At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable
Legal Requirements.

 



 

 **(e)** ** **Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold) from the Merger Consideration payable to any holder of the Shares or
any holder of Company Options or any other consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required, in Parents
reasonable discretion, by any Legal Requirement to deduct and withhold with
respect to Taxes. Each such payor shall take all action that may be necessary
to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are promptly and properly remitted
to the appropriate Governmental Body. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock, holder of Company Options or other recipient of consideration hereunder
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



      
 

 



 

 **(f)** ** **If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount
as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay (less any
amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.6(e)), in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Section 2.

 



 

 **2.7** ** ****Dissenters  Rights**. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and held by holders who are entitled
to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and have properly exercised
and perfected their respective demands for appraisal of such shares in the
time and manner provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the Effective
Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to such
appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the " ** _Dissenting Shares_** "), shall
not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration, but shall, by
virtue of the Merger, be entitled to only such consideration as shall be
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided, that_ if any such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost such holders right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such
holders shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been converted
as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to Section
2.6(e)), and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. Within
ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
provide each of the holders of Company Common Stock with the notice
contemplated by Section 262 of the DGCL. Parent, Purchaser and the Company
agree that the Surviving Corporation will not assert that any Top-Up Shares or
any promissory note used as a portion of the consideration for the Top-Up
Shares negatively impact the fair value of any Dissenting Shares. The Parties
hereby agree and acknowledge that in any appraisal proceeding with respect to
the Dissenting Shares, and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, the fair value if the Dissenting Shares will be determined in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL without regard to the Top-Up Option,
the Top-Up Shares or any promissory note delivered by Purchaser or Parent to
the Company in payment for the Top-Up Shares.

 



 

 **2.8** ** ****Treatment of Company Options and Warrants**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** **As of the Offer Acceptance Time, each Company Option that is
then outstanding and unexercised, whether or not vested, shall be cancelled.
Further, with respect to those Persons holding such cancelled Company Options
whose service relationship with the Company had not terminated more than three
months prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, such cancelled Company Options
shall be converted into the right to receive (x) a cash payment equal to (i)
the excess, if any, of (A) the Closing Amount over (B) the exercise price
payable per Share under such Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the total
number of shares of Company Common

 



      
 

 



 

Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance
Time (without regard to vesting) and (y) a CVR with respect to the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time (without regard to vesting). No
holder of a Company Option that has an exercise price per Share that is equal
to or greater than the Closing Amount shall be entitled to any payment with
respect to such cancelled Company Option before or after the Offer Acceptance
Time.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but
no later than the second payroll date after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall pay the aggregate consideration payable pursuant to Section
2.8(a)(x), net of any applicable withholding Taxes, payable with respect to
Company Options through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving Corporations
payroll (subject to any required tax withholdings) to the holders of Company
Options; _provided, however,_ that to the extent the holder of a Company
Option is not an employee, the consideration payable pursuant to Section
2.8(a)(x) payable with respect to such Company Options shall be paid in the
manner described in Section 2.6 through the Payment Fund rather than this
Section 2.8(b).

has maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as

designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures
that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

the Company; or (3) any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

 **(d)** ** **The Company maintains and has since January 1, 2010 maintained,
disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act that are reasonably designed to ensure that all information
required to be disclosed in the Companys reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
enable each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the

(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

 



 

 **(b)** ** **Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, at any time prior to Purchaser accepting, for the first time, for
payment and paying for such number of Shares validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as satisfies the Minimum Condition (the " **
_Offer Acceptance Time_** ") the Companys Board of Directors may make a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation if:

 



 

 **(i)** ** **if the Company has received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal did not arise out of a breach of Section
5.3) from any Person that has not been withdrawn and after consultation with
outside legal counsel, the Companys Board of Directors shall have determined,
in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, (x) the
Companys Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation,
or (y) the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) to
enter into a Specified Agreement with respect to such Superior Offer, if and
only if: (A) the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to do
so would reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board
of Directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Legal Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent prior written
notice of its intention to consider making a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) at least
four (4) business days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change
Recommendation or termination (a " ** _Determination Notice_** ") (which
notice shall not constitute a Company Adverse Change Recommendation); and (C)
(1) the Company shall have provided to Parent the material terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal in accordance with Section 8.1(f), (2)
the Company shall have given Parent the four (4) business days after the
Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or
make another proposal so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to
constitute a Superior Offer, and shall have negotiated in good faith with
Parent with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, and
(3) after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to
the proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, the Companys Board of Directors shall have determined, in good
faith, that such Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Offer and that the
failure to make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) would reasonably constitute a breach of
fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements. Issuance of any "stop, look
and listen" communication by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) shall not be considered a Company Adverse Change Recommendation and
shall not require the giving of a Determination Notice or compliance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 6.1. For the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of this Section 6.2(b)(i) shall also apply to any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal and

 



       
 

 



 

require a new Determination Notice, except that the references to four (4)
business days shall be deemed to be two (2) business days; and

 



 

 **(ii)** ** **other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the
Companys Board of Directors may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation
in response to a Change in Circumstance, if and only if: (A) the Companys
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably
constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the
Company to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (B)
the Company shall have given Parent a Determination Notice at least four (4)
business days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation;
and (C) (1) the Company shall have specified the Change in Circumstance in
reasonable detail, (2) the Company shall have given Parent the four (4)
business days after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms
of this Agreement or make another proposal so that such Change in Circumstance
would no longer necessitate a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, and shall
have negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to such proposed
revisions or other proposal, if any, and (3) after considering the results of
such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Companys Board of
Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the
Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to such Change in
Circumstance would reasonably continue to constitute a breach of fiduciary
duties of the Board of Directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Legal Requirements. For the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of this Section 6.1(b)(ii) shall also apply to any material change
to the facts and circumstances relating to such Change in Circumstance and
require a new Determination Notice, except that the references to four (4)
business days shall be deemed to be two (2) business days.

 



 

 **(c)** ** **If, following the Tender Completion Time, the adoption of this
Agreement by the holders of the Shares is required under the DGCL in order to
consummate the Merger, the Company shall take all actions in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements, the Companys certificate of incorporation and
bylaws and the rules of NASDAQ to promptly and duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold as promptly as practicable, a special meeting of its
stockholders to consider the adoption of this Agreement (the " ** _Special
Meeting_** "). For purposes of this Agreement, the term " ** _Tender
Completion Time_** " means the latest to occur of (x) the Offer Acceptance
Time and (y) if a subsequent offering period is commenced by Purchaser, the
expiration of such subsequent offering period.

 



 

 **(d)** ** **If the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of the Shares
is required under the DGCL in order to consummate the Merger as contemplated
by Section 6.1(c), the Company shall, as soon as practicable following the
Offer Acceptance Time, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in
preliminary form. Parent and Purchaser will be given a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the Proxy Statement prior to its filing with the SEC.
The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall
supply Parent and its counsel with copies of all

 



      
 

 



 

correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. Parent and Purchaser will be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement and
any communications, prior to making such filings or communications with the
SEC. The Company, Parent and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto. If at any time prior to receipt of the adoption of this
Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Vote there shall occur any event
that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement,
the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders such an
amendment or supplement to the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements. The Company shall not mail any Proxy Statement, or any amendment
or supplement thereto, to which Parent reasonably objects. The Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the holders of the Shares as promptly as practicable after the Proxy
Clearance Date. Parent agrees to cause all Shares owned by Parent or any
subsidiary of Parent to be voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at
the Special Meeting.

 



 

 **6.2** ** ****Filings, Consents and Approvals**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** **The Parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to take
promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under the Antitrust Laws, that may be asserted by any Governmental
Body or other person, so as to enable the Closing to occur expeditiously, but
in no case later than the End Date, including providing as promptly as
reasonably practicable all information required by any Governmental Body
pursuant to its evaluation of the Transactions under the HSR Act (or other
applicable Antitrust Laws). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither
this Section 6.2 nor the "reasonable best efforts" standard shall require or
obligate Parent or any of its Affiliates to (and in no event shall any
representation, warranty or covenant of Parent or Purchaser contained in this
Agreement be breached or deemed as a result of the failure of Parent to), or
permit the Company or any of its Affiliates to (and in no event shall any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Company contained in this
Agreement be breached or deemed as a result of the failure of the Company to),
(a) sell, license, divest or dispose of or hold separate (through the
establishment of a trust or otherwise), before or after the Offer Acceptance
Time or the Effective Time, any entities, assets, Intellectual Property Rights
or businesses of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Company (or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates) or (b) agree to any restriction
on its conduct. The Parties shall defend through litigation on the merits any
claim asserted in court by any party under Antitrust Laws in order to avoid
entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that could restrain, delay, or
prevent the Closing by the End Date.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
the Parties hereto shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if
applicable, to): (i) promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) business
days after the date hereof, (i) make an appropriate filing of all Notification
and Report forms as required by the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions;
(ii) promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) business days after the
date hereof, make all other filings, notifications or other consents as may be
required to be made or obtained by such Party

 



      
 

 



 

under foreign Antitrust Laws in those jurisdictions identified in Schedule
6.2(b), which contains the list of the only jurisdictions where clearance is a
condition to Closing; and (iii) cooperate with each other in determining
whether, and promptly preparing and making, any other filings, notifications
or other consents are required to be made with, or obtained from, any other
Governmental Bodies in connection with the Transactions.

 



 

 **(c)** ** **Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this
Section 6.2, during the Pre-Closing Period, each Party hereto shall (i) give
the other Parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding brought by a Governmental
Body or brought by a third party before any Governmental Body, in each case,
with respect to the Transactions, (ii) keep the other Parties reasonably
informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or Legal Proceeding, (iii) promptly inform the other Parties of any
communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Body in
connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding, (iv) promptly furnish to the other Party, subject to an
appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure to counsel and
outside consultants, with copies of documents provided to or received from any
Governmental Body in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding (other than "4(c) documents" as that term is used
in the rules and regulations under the HSR Act), (v) subject to an appropriate
confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure to counsel and outside
consultants, and to the extent reasonably practicable, consult and cooperate
with the other Parties and consider in good faith the views of the other
Parties in connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum,
brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, and (vi)
except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Body or by any Legal
Requirement, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding in respect of the Transactions, permit authorized
Representatives of the other Party to be present at each meeting or conference
relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding
and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any argument,
opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Body in connection
with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding.

 



 

 **6.3** ** ****Company Options; ESPP; Warrants**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** **Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all
actions (including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions
of the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof) that may be
necessary (under the Company Equity Plans and award agreements pursuant to
which Company Options are outstanding or otherwise) to (i) immediately prior
to the Offer Acceptance Time, accelerate the vesting and exercisability of
each unexpired and unexercised Company Option then outstanding and then held
by a Person whose service relationship with the Company had not terminated
more than three months prior to the Offer Acceptance Time (or one year prior
to the Offer Acceptance Time, with respect to the 2010 Directors Plan) so
that each such Company Option shall be fully vested and exercisable prior to
the Offer Acceptance Time, (ii) terminate each Company Equity Plan (except as
otherwise agreed by Parent) and (iii) cause, as of the Offer Acceptance Time,
each unexpired and

 



      
 

 



 

unexercised Company Option then outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time, whether vested or unvested (and each plan, if any,
under which any Company Option may be granted except, with respect to any such
plan, as otherwise agreed by Parent) to be cancelled, terminated and
extinguished, subject, if applicable, to payment pursuant to Section 2.8 (or,
with respect to Non-Employee Optionees, Section 2.6).

 



 

 **(b)** ** **Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary or required under the ESPP and Legal Requirements to (i)
ensure that, except for the six month purchase period under the ESPP that
commenced on May 21, 2013, no purchase period or offering period shall be
authorized or commenced on or after the date of this Agreement, (ii) ensure
that, for the offering period commenced on May 21, 2013, no employee who is
not a participant in the ESPP as of the date hereof may become a participant
after the date hereof and (iii) if the Closing shall occur prior to the end of
the offering period in existence under the ESPP on the date of this Agreement,
cause the rights of participants in the ESPP with respect to any such offering
period then underway under the ESPP to be determined by treating the last
business day prior to the Offer Acceptance Time as the last day of such
offering period and by making such other pro-rata adjustments as may be
necessary to reflect the shortened offering period but otherwise treating such
shortened offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period
for all purposes under the ESPP. The Company shall terminate the ESPP in its
entirety effective as of the Offer Acceptance Time. Prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions (including, if
appropriate, amending the terms of the ESPP) that are necessary to give effect
to the transactions contemplated by this Section 6.3(b).

 



 

 **(c)** ** **Following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to assume all outstanding Company Warrants set forth on Schedule
6.3(c) and take all actions necessary and required to comply with the terms of
such Company Warrants.

 



 

 **6.4** ** ****Employee Benefits**. For a period of one year following the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to those
employees of the Company who are employed by the Company as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and who continue to be actively employed by the
Surviving Corporation (or any Affiliate thereof) during such one year period
(the " ** _Continuing Employees_** ") base salary and base wages, short-term
cash incentive compensation opportunities and benefits (including severance
benefits) (excluding equity based compensation) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to such base salary and base wages, short-term
cash incentive compensation opportunities and benefits (including severance
benefits) (excluding equity based compensation) provided to such Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement. The Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to implement a severance plan,
including approving such arrangements in accordance with Section 6.12, that is
reasonably acceptable to Parent comprising cash payments with a value of not
more than $6,000,000. Without limiting the foregoing:

 



 

 **(a)** ** **Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to
continue to participate in the Surviving Corporations health and welfare
benefit plans (to the same extent such Continuing Employees were eligible to
participate under the Companys health and welfare

 



      
 

 



 

benefit plans immediately prior to the Effective Time); _provided, however,_
that (i) nothing in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate
any such health or welfare benefit plan at any time and (ii) if Parent or the
Surviving Corporation terminates any such health or welfare benefit plan, then
(upon expiration of any appropriate transition period), the Continuing
Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Surviving Corporations
health and welfare benefit plans to the extent that coverage under such plans
is replacing comparable coverage under an Employee Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time. To the
extent that service is relevant for eligibility or vesting under any health or
welfare benefit plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, then Parent
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such health or
welfare benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility and vesting, but not
for purposes of benefit accrual, credit Continuing Employees for service prior
to the Effective Time with the Company to the same extent that such service
was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding health or
welfare benefit plan of the Company. In addition, the Parent and/or the
Surviving Corporation shall credit each Continuing Employee with paid time off
equal to the accrued paid time off such Continuing Employee had accrued with
the Company that was unused as of the Effective Time. For purposes of
determining the amount of paid time off only, to the extent that service is
relevant for benefit levels, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that any employee plan of Parent and/or the Surviving
Corporation shall, for purposes of benefit levels, credit Continuing Employees
for service prior to the Effective Time with the Company to the same extent
that such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the
corresponding Employee Plan of the Company. Nothing in this Section 6.4 or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any Person
to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Affiliate of
the Surviving Corporation or to any compensation or benefits and the
employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **The provisions of this Section 6.4 are solely for the benefit of
the Parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 6.4 is
intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an
amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and
no current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the
Agreement or have the right to enforce the provisions hereof.

 



 

 **6.5** ** ****Indemnification of Officers and Directors**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** **All rights to indemnification by the Company existing in favor
of those Persons who are directors and officers of the Company as of the date
of this Agreement (the " ** _Indemnified Persons_** ") for their acts and
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws of the Company (as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement) and as provided in the indemnification agreements
between the Company and said Indemnified Persons (as set forth on Part 6.5(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule and in effect as of the date of this
Agreement) in the forms made available by the Company to Parent or Parents
Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement, shall survive

 



      
 

 



 

the Merger and shall be observed by the Surviving Corporation (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to observe) to the fullest extent
available under Delaware law for a period of six years from the Effective
Time, and any claim made requesting indemnification pursuant to such
indemnification rights within such six-year period shall continue to be
subject to this Section 6.5(a) and the indemnification rights provided under
this Section 6.5(a) until disposition of such claim.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, the
existing policy of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by
the Company as of the date of this Agreement (an accurate and complete copy of
which has been made available by the Company to Parent or Parents
Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement) for the benefit of the
Indemnified Persons who are currently covered by such existing policy with
respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time in
their capacities as directors and officers of the Company (as applicable), on
terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less favorable than
the existing policy (or at or prior to the Effective Time Parent or the
Company may (through a nationally recognized insurance broker approved by
Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned)) purchase a six-year "tail" policy for the existing policy
effective as of the Effective Time) and if such "tail policy" has been
obtained, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain and/or
maintain insurance pursuant to this Section 6.5(b); _provided, however_ , that
in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one
year an amount in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently payable by
the Company with respect to such current policy, it being understood that if
the annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount,
Parent shall be obligated to cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such amount.

 



 

 **(c)** ** **In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parents option, Parent, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5.

 



 

 **(d)** ** **The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall survive the acceptance
of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs. Unless
required by applicable Legal Requirement, this Section 6.5 may not be amended,
altered or repealed after the Offer Acceptance Time in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or any of their
successors, assigns or heirs without the prior written consent of the affected
Indemnified Person.

 



 

 **6.6** ** ****Securityholder Litigation**. The Company shall give Parent the
right to review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by
the Company in connection with

 



      
 

 



 

any litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
Transactions, and the right to consult on any settlement with respect to such
litigation, and the Company will in good faith take such comments into
account, and, no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such litigation and
shall keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the status
thereof.

 



 

 **6.7** ** ****Additional Agreements**. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, including Section 6.2(a), Parent and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger and make effective the other
Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party to this Agreement (i) shall
make all filings (if any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made
and given by such Party in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the
other Transactions, (ii) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
each Consent (if any) required to be obtained pursuant to any applicable Legal
Requirement or Material Contract by such Party in connection with the
Transactions, and (iii) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to lift any
restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Offer or the Merger brought by
any third Person against such Party. The Company shall promptly deliver to
Parent a copy of each such filing made, each such notice given and each such
Consent obtained by the Company during the Pre-Closing Period.

 



 

 **6.8** ** ****Disclosure**. The initial press release relating to this
Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent and
thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing
any further press release(s) or otherwise making any public statement or
making any announcement to Company Associates (to the extent not previously
issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Offer,
the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other Transactions and shall not
issue any such press release, public statement or announcement to Company
Associates without the other Partys written consent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing: (a) each Party may, without such consultation or consent, make any
public statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors
or those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to
employees and make disclosures in Company SEC Documents, so long as such
statements are consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved by
the other Party), (b) a Party may, without the prior consent of the other
Party hereto but subject to giving advance notice to the other Party, issue
any such press release or make any such public announcement or statement as
may be required by Legal Requirement; and (c) the Company need not consult
with Parent in connection with such portion of any press release, public
statement or filing to be issued or made pursuant to Section 5.3(e) or with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Company Adverse Change Recommendation.

 



 

 **6.9** ** ****Takeover Laws; Advice of Changes**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** **If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable
to the Transactions, each of Parent and the Company and the members of their
respective Boards of

 



      
 

 



 

Directors shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and conditions
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to lawfully eliminate the effect of any
Takeover Law on any of the Transactions.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **The Company will give prompt notice to Parent (and will
subsequently keep Parent informed on a current basis of any developments
related to such notice) upon its becoming aware of the occurrence or existence
of any fact, event or circumstance that (i) has had or would reasonably be
expected to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii)
is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in Section 7
or **Annex I** not being able to be satisfied prior to the End Date. Parent
will give prompt notice to the Company (and will subsequently keep the Company
informed on a current basis of any developments related to such notice) upon
its becoming aware of the occurrence or existence of any fact, event or
circumstance that (i) has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or (ii) is reasonably likely to result in any of the
conditions set forth in Section 7 not being able to be satisfied prior to the
End Date.

of Directors, shall, to the extent necessary, take appropriate action, prior
to or as of the Offer Acceptance Time, to approve, for purposes of Section

disposition and cancellation of shares of Company Common Stock, Company
Options and Company Warrants in the Transactions by applicable individuals and
to cause such dispositions and/or cancellations to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 **6.12** ** ****Rule 14d-10 Matters**. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time
and to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the Compensation
Committee of the Companys Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and
held, will approve, as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under
the Exchange Act, each agreement, arrangement or understanding between
Purchaser, the Company or their respective Affiliates and any of the officers,
directors or employees of the Company that are effective as of the date of
this Agreement or are entered into after the date of this Agreement and prior
to the Offer Acceptance Time pursuant to which compensation is paid to such
officer, director or employee and will take all other action reasonably
necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set
forth in Rule 14d-10(d) (2) under the Exchange Act.

 



 

 **6.13** ** ****Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration. **Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be

satisfaction, at or prior to the Closing, of each of the following conditions:

 



 

 **7.1** ** ****No Restraints**. There shall not have been issued by any court

 **SECTION 8.** ** ****TERMINATION**

 



 

 **8.1** ** ****Termination**. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the
Effective Time (whether before or after the adoption of this Agreement by the
Required Stockholder Vote, except as otherwise expressly noted):

 



      
 

 



 

 **(a)** ** **by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company at any time
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time;

 



 

 **(b)** ** **by either Parent or the Company if the Offer shall have expired
without the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer; _provided,
however,_ that a Party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) if the failure of the acceptance for payment
of Shares pursuant to the Offer is attributable to a failure on the part of
such Party to perform in all material respects any covenant or obligation in
this Agreement required to be performed by such Party at or prior to the
acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer and such Party has not
cured such failure within ten (10) days after having received notice thereof;

 



 

 **(c)** ** **by either Parent or the Company if a court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Body shall have issued a decree or ruling,
or shall have taken any other action, having the effect of (i) permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the acceptance for payment of
Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger, (ii) making consummation of the
Offer or the Merger illegal, (iii) restraining or prohibiting Parents or its
Affiliates ownership or operation of the business of the Company, or of Parent
or Affiliates, or to compel Parent or any of its Affiliates to dispose of or
hold separate all or any portion of the business or assets of the Company or
of Parent or its Affiliates or (iv) impose or confirming material limitations
on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates effectively to exercise full
rights of ownership of the Shares, which order, decree, ruling or other action
shall be final and nonappealable; _provided, however,_ that a Party shall not
be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) if
the issuance of such final and nonappealable order, decree, ruling or other
action is attributable to a failure on the part of such Party to perform in
any material respect any covenant or obligation in this Agreement required to
be performed by such Party at or prior to the Effective Time;

 



 

 **(d)** ** **by Parent at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if,
whether or not permitted to do so: (i) the Companys Board of Directors shall
have failed to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9
when mailed or shall have effected a Company Adverse Change Recommendation;
(ii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have failed to publicly
reaffirm its recommendation of this Agreement in the absence of a publicly
announced Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) business days after Parent so
requests in writing, or, if earlier, two (2) business days prior to the
Expiration Date, _provided that_ , unless an Acquisition Proposal shall have
been publicly disclosed, Parent may only make such request once every thirty
(30) days; or (iii) in the case of a tender offer or exchange offer subject to
Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act, the Companys Board of Directors fails
to recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9,
rejection of such tender offer or exchange offer within ten (10) business days
of the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer, or, if earlier,
two (2) business days prior to the Expiration Date, or (iv) there has been a
material breach of Section 5.3;

 



       
 

 



 

 **(e)** ** **by either Parent or the Company if the Offer Acceptance Time
shall not have occurred on or prior to the close of business on the earlier to
occur of (i) April 30, 2014 or (ii) sixty (60) days after Parent certifies
substantial compliance with a second request for additional information from
the FTC unless prior to the date set forth in (i) above, Parent initiates
litigation against the FTC seeking legal clearance to consummate the
Transactions (such date, the " ** _End Date_** "), _provided, however,_ that a
Party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(e) if the failure of the Offer Acceptance Time to occur prior to
the End Date is attributable to the failure on the part of such Party to
perform in any material respect any covenant or obligation in this Agreement
required to be performed by such Party;

 



 

 **(f)** ** **by the Company, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time,
in order to accept a Superior Offer and, substantially concurrent with such
termination, to enter into a binding written definitive acquisition agreement
providing for the consummation of a transaction constituting a Superior Offer
(a " ** _Specified Agreement_** "), if (i) the Company has complied in all
material respects with the requirements of Section 5.3 and Section 6.1(b) and
(ii) prior to such termination (or if the Specified Agreement is executed on a
day that is not a business day, the preceding business day), the Company pays
the Termination Fee due to Parent under Section 8.3(b);

 



 

 **(g)** ** **by Parent at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if a
breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or
failure to perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement on the part of
the Company shall have occurred such that the condition set forth in clause
"(b)" or "(c)" of **Annex I** would not be satisfied and cannot be cured by
the Company, or if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within
forty-five (45) days of the date Parent gives the Company notice of such
breach or failure to perform (which, with respect to the failure by the
Company to timely file or mail the 14D-9, shall not have been cured within
three (3) business days of the date Parent gives the Company notice of such
breach or failure to perform); _provided, however,_ that, Parent shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) if
either Parent or Purchaser is then in material breach of any representations,
warranties, covenants or obligation hereunder;

 



 

 **(h)** ** **by the Company at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time,
if a breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or
failure to perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement on the part of
Parent or Purchaser shall have occurred, in each case if such breach or
failure has had or would reasonably be expected to prevent Parent or Purchaser
from consummating the Transactions and such breach of failure cannot be
satisfied and cannot be cured by Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, or if
capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within forty-five (45) days
of the date the Company gives Parent notice of such breach or failure to
perform; _provided, however,_ that, the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(h) if the Company is
then in material breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or
obligation hereunder; or

 



 

 **(i)** ** **by the Company if Purchaser shall have failed to commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer within the
period specified in

 



      
 

 



 

Section 1.1(a) or if Purchaser shall have failed to purchase all Shares
validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) as of the expiration of the Offer
(as may be extended) and has not cured such failure within three (3) business
days of the date on which the Company gives Parent notice of such failure.

 



 

 **8.2** ** ****Effect of Termination**. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall be
given to the other Party or Parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant
to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall be of no further
force or effect and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent,
Purchaser or the Company or their respective directors, officers and
Affiliates following any such termination; _provided, however,_ that (a) this
Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Section 9 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect, (b) the Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms; and (c) subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 8.3, the termination of this Agreement shall
not relieve any Party from any liability or damages resulting from any willful
and material breach of this Agreement prior to the date of termination.
Nothing shall limit or prevent any Party from exercising any rights or
remedies it may have under Section 9.5(b) in lieu of terminating this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.

 



 

 **8.3** ** ****Expenses; Termination Fees**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** **Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid
by the Party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Offer and Merger are
consummated.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **In the event that:

 



 

 **(i)** ** **this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(f);

 



 

 **(ii)** ** **this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(d); or

 



 

 **(iii)** ** **(x) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b),
Section 8.1(e), or Section 8.1(g), (y) any Person shall have publicly
disclosed a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof and prior
to such termination (unless such Acquisition Proposal is irrevocably, in good
faith and publicly withdrawn prior to such termination) and (z) within twelve
(12) months of such termination the Company shall have entered into a
definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or consummated an
Acquisition Proposal (provided that for purposes of this clause (z) the
references to "20%" in the definition of " ** _Acquisition Proposal_** " shall
be deemed to be references to "50%"); then, in any such event under clause
"(i)", "(ii)" or "(iii)" of this Section 8.3(b), the Company shall pay to
Parent or its designee the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds
(x) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(ii), within two (2) business days after such
termination, (y) prior to (or if the Specified

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement is executed on a day that is not a business day, the following
business day) such termination if pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(i) or (z) in the
case of Section 8.3(b)(iii), prior to the consummation of the Acquisition
Proposal referred to in Section 8.3(b)(iii)(z) above; it being understood that
in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more
than one occasion. As used herein, " ** _Termination Fee_** " shall mean a
cash amount equal to $23,300,000. In the event that Parent or its designee
shall receive full payment pursuant to this Section 8.3(b), the receipt of the
Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Purchaser, any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof)
or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent,
Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates (collectively, " ** _Parent
Related Parties_** ") or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its
Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the
Transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination; _provided,
however,_ that nothing in this Section 8.3(b) shall limit the rights of Parent
or Purchaser under Section 9.5(b); _provided, further, however,_ nothing in
this Section 8.3(b) shall relieve the Company of liability for any willful and
material breach of this Agreement.

 



 

 **(c)** ** **Reserved

 



 

 **(d)** ** **In the event that this Agreement (i) is terminated (A) by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e) and either (1) the condition
set forth in clause (e) of Annex I shall not have been satisfied, (2) the
condition set forth in clause (g) of Annex I shall not have been satisfied as
a result of any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent
injunction or other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction under
any Antitrust Laws (including the HSR Act) in respect of this Agreement or the
Transactions, (3) any Governmental Body shall have filed suit to seek an
injunction against consummation of the Transactions on the grounds that they
violate or may violate Antitrust Law, and such suit has not been dismissed, or
(4) the condition set forth in clause (h) of Annex I shall not have been
satisfied or (B) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c) as
a result of any permanent injunction or other final, non-appealable order
issued by any court of competent jurisdiction under any Antitrust Laws
(including the HSR Act) in respect of this Agreement or the Transactions) and
(ii) the Company has not materially breached any of its obligations under
Section 6.2, then Parent shall pay the Company $38,800,000 (the " ** _Parent
Termination Fee_** "), by wire transfer of same day funds within two (2)
business days after any such termination. In the event that the Company or its
designee shall receive full payment pursuant to this Section 8.3(d), the
receipt of the Parent Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages
for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company, any of
its respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby
(and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and none of the Company and any of its respective former, current
or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, optionholders,
managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, " ** _Company Related
Parties_** ") or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
claim,

 



      
 

 



 

action or proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out
of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any
matters forming the basis for such termination; _provided, however,_ that
nothing in this Section 8.3(d) shall limit the rights of the Company under
Section 9.5(b); _provided, further, however,_ nothing in this Section 8.3(d)
shall relieve Parent and the Purchaser of liability for any willful and
material breach of this Agreement.

 



 

 **(e)** ** **The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to timely pay any
amount due pursuant to this Section 8.3, and, in order to obtain the payment,
Parent or the Company, as applicable, commences a Legal Proceeding which
results in a judgment against the Company or Parent, as applicable, the
Company shall pay Parent (in the case of an award against the Company with
respect to the Termination Fee), or Parent shall pay the Company (in the case
of an award against Parent with respect to the Parent Termination Fee), as
applicable its reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in the
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date such payment was actually received.

 



 

 **(f)** ** **In the event that the Parent Termination Fee becomes payable,
Parent shall not be entitled to a Termination Fee pursuant to Section
8.3(b)(iii) with respect to a termination under Section 8.1(e).

 



 

 **SECTION 9.** ** ****MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS**

 



 

 **9.1** ** ****Amendment**. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to Section
6.5(d) and subject to Section 1.4(c) in the case of the Company, this
Agreement may be amended with the approval of the respective Boards of
Directors of the Company and Parent at any time; _provided_ that after the
Offer Acceptance Time no amendment shall be made which decreases the Merger
Consideration and, after the approval of this Agreement by the stockholders,
no amendment shall be made which by applicable Legal Requirements requires
further approval by such stockholders without obtaining such further approval.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 



 

 **9.2** ** ****Waiver**. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the
part of any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under
this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any
claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege
or remedy is expressly set forth in a written

 



      
 

 



 

instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such
waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific
instance in which it is given.

 



 

 **9.3** ** ****No Survival of Representations and Warranties**. None of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Schedule or in any certificate or schedule or other document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger.

 



 

 **9.4** ** ****Entire Agreement; Counterparts**. This Agreement and the other
agreements, annexes and schedules referred to herein constitute the entire
agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among or between any of the Parties, with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof; _provided, however,_ that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall not be superseded and shall remain in full force and effect;
_provided, further, that,_ if the Effective Time occurs, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no further force and effect.
This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same
instrument. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by PDF shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

 **9.5** ** ****Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific
Performance; Remedies**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** **This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.
Subject to Section 9.5(c), in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, its negotiation or any of the Transactions: (i)
each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if such court lacks
subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New
Castle County in the State of Delaware, (it being agreed that the consents to
jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 9.5(a) shall not constitute
general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have
no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not
be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties hereto); and
(ii) each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of process by first
class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the
address at which such Party is to receive notice in accordance with Section
9.8. The Parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Legal
Requirements; _provided, however,_ that nothing in the foregoing shall
restrict any Partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any
appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

 



 

 **(b)** ** **The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the Parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement in accordance

 



      
 

 



 

with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Subject to the
following sentence, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or
other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in
Section 9.5(a) without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, (ii) the
provisions set forth in Section 8.3 (A) are not intended to and do not
adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this
Agreement and (B) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in
any respect any Partys right to specific enforcement and (iii) the right of
specific performance is an integral part of the Transactions and without that
right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.
Each of the Parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
the other Parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this Section 9.5(b) shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 



 

 **(c)** ** **EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



 

 **9.6** ** ****Assignability**. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and
shall be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided, however,_
that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned
without the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto, and any
attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such
consent shall be void and of no effect; _provided, further, however,_ that
Parent or Purchaser may assign this Agreement to any of their Affiliates (
_provided_ that such assignment shall not impede or delay the consummation of
the Transactions or otherwise impede the rights of the stockholders of the
Company under this Agreement); _provided that_ no such assignment or pledge
permitted pursuant to this Section 9.6 shall relieve Parent of its obligations
hereunder.

 



 

 **9.7** ** ****No Third Party Beneficiaries**. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than
the Parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement; except for: (i) if the Offer Acceptance
Time occurs (A) the right of each Company stockholder to receive the Offer
Price at the Offer Acceptance Time or the Merger Consideration at the
Effective Time, (B) the right of each holder of Company Options to receive the
consideration due to it pursuant to Section 2.6 or 2.8, as applicable or (c)
the right of each holder of Company Warrants set forth on Schedule 2.8(c) to
receive the consideration due to it pursuant to Section 2.8, as applicable,
(ii) if the Closing occurs, the right of each holder of Company Warrants to
the treatment set forth in

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.3; (iii) the provisions set forth in Section 6.5 of this Agreement
and (iv) the rights of the Company Related Parties in Section 8.3(d) and the
Parent Related Parties in Section 8.3(c).

 



 

 **9.8** ** ****Notices**. Any notice or other communication required or
permitted to be delivered to any Party under this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed properly delivered, given and received (a) upon
receipt when delivered by hand, (b) two (2) business days after being sent by
registered mail or by courier or express delivery service, (c) if sent by
email transmission prior to 6:00 p.m. recipients local time, upon
transmission when receipt is confirmed, or (d) if sent by email transmission
after 6:00 p.m. recipients local time and receipt is confirmed, the business
day following the date of transmission; _provided that_ in each case the

set forth beneath the name of such Party below (or to such other physical
address or email address as such Party shall have specified in a written

 **9.9** ** ****Severability**. Any term or provision of this Agreement that
is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of
this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties hereto
agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit
such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in
the prior sentence, the Parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

 **WHEREAS** , capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined have
the meaning given to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in contemplation of the foregoing and in consideration
of the mutual agreements, covenants, representations and warranties contained
herein and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

 



 

1. _Certain Covenants_.

 



 

1.1 _Lock-Up_. Subject to Section 1.5, except as contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees that between the date
hereof and the Termination Date, Stockholder will not (a) directly or
indirectly, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, tender, encumber or
otherwise dispose of or limit its right to vote in any manner any of the
Securities, or agree to do any of the foregoing, or (b) take any action which

defined in the Merger Agreement), Stockholder may transfer any or all of the
Securities as follows: (i) in the case of a Stockholder that is an entity, to
any parent entity, subsidiary or affiliate under common control with such

_provided_ , _however_ , that in any such case, prior to and as a condition to
the effectiveness of such transfer, (x) each person to which any of such
Securities or any interest in any of such Securities is or may be transferred
shall have executed and delivered to Parent and Purchaser a counterpart to
this Agreement pursuant to which such person shall be bound by all of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, and (y) this Agreement shall be the
legal, valid and binding agreement of such person, enforceable against such
person in accordance with its terms.

 



 

1.2 RESERVED

 



 

1.3 _Certain Events_. This Agreement and the obligations hereunder will attach
to the Securities and will be binding upon any person to which legal or
beneficial ownership of any or all of the Securities passes, whether by
operation of Law or otherwise, including without limitation, Stockholders
successors or assigns. This Agreement and the obligations hereunder will also
attach to any additional Shares or other Securities of the Company issued to
or acquired by Stockholder.

 



 

1.4 _Grant of Proxy; Voting Agreement_.

 



 

(a) The Stockholder has revoked or terminated any proxies, voting agreements
or similar arrangements previously given or entered into with respect to the
Securities and hereby irrevocably appoints Parent as proxy for Stockholder to
vote the Securities for Stockholder and in Stockholders name, place and
stead, at any annual or special meeting, or at any adjournment thereof or
pursuant to any consent of the holders of the Shares, in lieu of a meeting or
otherwise, whether before or after the Acceptance Time (as defined in the
Merger Agreement), for the adoption of the Merger Agreement and against any
Acquisition Proposal. Stockholder may vote the Securities in its sole
discretion on all other matters not referred to in this Section 1.4(a), and
Parent may not exercise this proxy with respect to such other matters. The
parties acknowledge and agree that neither Parent, nor Parents successors,
assigns, subsidiaries, divisions, employees, officers, directors,
stockholders, agents and affiliates shall owe any duty to, whether in law or
otherwise, or incur any liability of any kind whatsoever, including without
limitation, with respect to any and all claims, losses, demands, causes of
action, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) and
compensation of any kind or nature whatsoever to Stockholder in connection
with or as a result of any voting by Parent of the Securities or any execution
of any consent in accordance with this Section 1.4(a). The parties acknowledge
that, pursuant to the authority hereby granted under the irrevocable proxy,
Parent may vote the Securities in furtherance of its own interests, and Parent
is not acting as a fiduciary for Stockholder.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing grant to Parent of the irrevocable proxy, if
Parent elects not to exercise its rights to vote the Securities pursuant to
the irrevocable

      
 

 



 

proxy, Stockholder agrees to vote the Securities during the term of this
Agreement in favor of or give its consent to, as applicable, a proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement and otherwise as described in Section 1.4(a) at any
annual or special meeting or action of the holders of the Shares in lieu of a
meeting or otherwise.

 



 

(c) This irrevocable proxy shall not be terminated by any act of Stockholder
or by operation of law, whether by the death or incapacity of Stockholder or
by the occurrence of any other event or events (including, without limiting
the foregoing, the termination of any trust or estate for which Stockholder is
acting as a fiduciary or fiduciaries or the dissolution or liquidation of any
corporation or partnership). If between the execution hereof and the
Termination Date, Stockholder should die or become incapacitated, or if any
trust or estate holding the Securities should be terminated, or if any
corporation or partnership holding the Securities should be dissolved or
liquidated, or if any other such similar event or events shall occur before
the Termination Date, certificates representing the Securities shall be
delivered by or on behalf of Stockholder in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement and this Agreement, and actions taken by
Parent hereunder shall be as valid as if such death, incapacity, termination,
dissolution, liquidation or other similar event or events had not occurred,
regardless of whether or not Parent has received notice of such death,
incapacity, termination, dissolution, liquidation or other event.

 



 

(d) The irrevocable proxy granted pursuant to this Section 1.4 will terminate
on the Termination Date.

 



 

1.5 _Tender of Securities_. Stockholder agrees, in exchange for the
consideration described in the Merger Agreement, to tender the Shares
beneficially owned as of the date hereof and set forth on Schedule I hereto to
Purchaser in the Offer as soon as practicable following the commencement of
the Offer, and in any event not later than ten (10) business days following
the commencement of the Offer, or if Stockholder has not received the Offer
Documents by such time, within two (2) business days following Stockholders
receipt of such Offer Documents but in any event prior to the Expiration Date.
Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms,
Stockholder shall not withdraw any such Shares so tendered unless the Offer is
terminated.

 



 

1.6 RESERVED

 



 

1.7 _Public Announcement_. Stockholder shall consult with Parent before
issuing any press releases or otherwise making any public statements with

press release or make any such public statement without the approval of
Parent, except as may be required by Law, including any filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "). This Section 1.6
shall terminate and be null and void upon the earlier of (i) the Termination
Date and (ii) consummation of the Merger.

publish and disclose in any announcement or disclosure required by the SEC,
The Nasdaq Stock Market or any other national securities exchange and in the

arising through Stockholder.

2.3 _No Violation_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor

Stockholder to file or register with, or obtain any permit, authorization,
consent or approval of, any governmental agency, authority, administrative or

entity other than filings with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, or (b)
violate, or cause a breach of or default under, or conflict with any contract,

violations, breaches, defaults or conflicts which are not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
Stockholders ability to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement. No
proceedings are pending which, if adversely determined, will have an adverse
effect on Stockholders ability

      
 

 



 

to vote or dispose of any of the Securities. The Stockholder has not
previously assigned or sold any of the Securities set forth on _Schedule I_
hereto to any third party.

 



 

2.4 _Stockholder Has Adequate Information_. Stockholder is a sophisticated
seller with respect to the Securities and has adequate information concerning
the business and financial condition of the Company to make an informed
decision regarding the sale of the Securities and has independently and
without reliance upon either Purchaser or Parent and based on such information
as Stockholder has deemed appropriate, made its own analysis and decision to
enter into this Agreement. Stockholder acknowledges that neither Purchaser nor
Parent has made and neither makes any representation or warranty, whether
express or implied, of any kind or character except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement. Stockholder acknowledges that the agreements contained herein
with respect to the Securities by Stockholder are irrevocable (prior to the

Securities, Parent or Purchaser, except with respect to breaches of
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements expressly set forth in
this Agreement.

delivered this Agreement and this Agreement is a legal, valid and binding
agreement of each of Parent and Purchaser, enforceable against each of Parent
and Purchaser in accordance with its terms.

 



 

3.2 _No Violation_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will violate, or
cause a breach of or default under, any contract or agreement, any statute or
law, or any judgment, decree, order, regulation or rule of any governmental
agency, authority, administrative or regulatory body, court or other tribunal,
foreign or domestic, or any other entity or any arbitration award binding upon
Parent or Purchaser, except for such violations, breaches or defaults which
are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on either Parents
or Purchasers ability to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

4. _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The respective representations and warranties of Stockholder, Parent and Purchaser contained herein shall not be deemed waived or otherwise affected by any investigation made by the other party hereto. The representations and warranties contained herein shall not survive the Termination Date, subject to Section 6.1.

 



 

5. _Specific Performance_. Stockholder acknowledges that Purchaser and Parent will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate remedy at law for a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of Stockholder which are contained in this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedies which may be available to Purchaser

      
 

 



 

and Parent upon the breach by Stockholder of such covenants and agreements,
Purchaser and Parent shall have the right to obtain injunctive relief to
restrain any breach or threatened breach of such covenants or agreements or
otherwise to obtain specific performance of any of such covenants or
agreements.

for an identical value of potential payments under the CVR Agreement (as
defined in the Merger Agreement), if approved by the Companys Board of
Directors, shall not result in a termination of this Agreement, and (iv) the
termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 8 thereof and, if due
in connection therewith, the payment in full of the Termination Fee (the
earliest of (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), the " _Termination Date_ "). Upon
termination of this Agreement, all obligations of the parties under this
Agreement will terminate, without any liability or other obligation on the
part of any party hereto to any Person in respect hereof or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and no party shall have any claim against another (and no
person shall have any rights against such party), whether under contract, tort
or otherwise, with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided, however,
that the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party from
liability arising from any willful breach prior to such termination.

contrary: (a) Stockholder makes no agreement or understanding herein in any
capacity other than in Stockholders capacity as a record holder and
beneficial owner of Securities, and (b) nothing herein will be construed to
limit or affect any action or inaction by Stockholder or any Representative of

respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as provided in Section
1.1, no party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the
other parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of Parent and Purchaser may
freely assign its rights to another direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary

hereunder. Any purported assignment requiring consent without such consent
shall be void.

counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but each of which together
shall constitute one and the same Agreement.

programs and coupon discounts;

payable to any third party providing distribution services to the Selling
Entities.

categories set forth in clauses (1) through (9) above, such item may not be
deducted more than once.

(including by consolidation or merger) or without consideration in connection
with the dissolution, liquidation or termination of any corporation, limited
liability company, partnership or other entity; or (d) in the case of CVRs

2. CONTINGENT Value RIGHTS

 



 

2.1. _CVRs_. The CVRs represent the rights of Holders to receive contingent
cash payments pursuant to this Agreement. The initial Holders will be
determined pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.

 



 

2.2. _Nontransferable_. The CVRs may not be sold, assigned, transferred,
pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or disposed of, in
whole or in part, other than through a Permitted Transfer.

 



 

2.3. _No Certificate; Registration; Registration of Transfer; Change of
Address_.

 



 

(a) The CVRs will not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument.

 



 

(b) The Rights Agent will keep a register (the " _CVR Register_ ") for the
purpose of registering CVRs and transfers of CVRs as herein provided. The CVR
Register will initially show one position for Cede and Co representing all the
shares of Company Common Stock held by DTC on behalf of the street holders of
the shares of Company Common Stock tendered by such holders in the Offer or
held by such holders as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Rights
Agent will have no responsibility whatsoever directly to the street name
holders with respect to transfers of CVRs. With respect to any payments to be
made under Section 2.4 below, the Rights Agent will accomplish the payment to
any former street name holders of shares of Company Common Stock by sending
one lump payment to DTC. The Rights Agent will have no

 



      
 

 



 

responsibilities whatsoever with regard to the distribution of payments by DTC
to such street name holders.

 



 

(c) Subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in Section 2.2,
every request made to transfer a CVR must be in writing and accompanied by a
written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Rights
Agent pursuant to its guidelines, duly executed by the Holder thereof, the
Holders attorney duly authorized in writing, the Holders personal
representative or the Holders survivor, and setting forth in reasonable
detail the circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon receipt of such
written notice, the Rights Agent will, subject to its reasonable determination
that the transfer instrument is in proper form and the transfer otherwise
complies with the other terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the
provisions of Section 2.2), register the transfer of the CVRs in the CVR
Register. Parent and Rights Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any stamp or other tax or governmental charge that is imposed in
connection with any such registration of transfer. The Rights Agent shall have
no duty or obligation to take any action under any section of this Agreement
that requires the payment by a Holder of a CVR of applicable taxes or charges
unless and until the Rights Agent is satisfied that all such taxes or charges
have been paid. All duly transferred CVRs registered in the CVR Register will
be the valid obligations of Parent and will entitle the transferee to the same
benefits and rights under this Agreement as those held immediately prior to
the transfer by the transferor. No transfer of a CVR will be valid until
registered in the CVR Register.

 



 

(d) A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to change such
Holders address of record in the CVR Register. The written request must be
duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights
Agent will, subject to its reasonable determination that the transfer
instrument is in proper form, promptly record the change of address in the CVR
Register.

 



 

2.4. _Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(a) On or before February 15, 2017, Parent will deliver to the Rights Agent
(i) a notice (the " _Milestone Notice_ ") indicating whether the Sales
Milestone was achieved and (ii) the Net Sales Statement for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2016 along with any letter of instruction required by the
Rights Agent. In addition, in the event that Parent does not timely file, in
accordance with applicable SEC rules and regulations, with the SEC a quarterly
report on Form 10-Q with respect to any of the first, second or third fiscal
quarters of 2016, Parent will deliver to the Rights Agent on or before the
45th day following the completion of any such fiscal quarter of 2016 a Net
Sales Statement with respect to all then completed fiscal quarters during the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.

 



 

(b) The Rights Agent will promptly, and in any event within ten Business Days
of receipt of a Milestone Notice and/or Net Sales Statement as well as any
letter of instruction required by the Rights Agent, send each Holder at its
registered address a copy of such Milestone Notice and/or Net Sales Statement.
If a Payment Amount is payable to the Holders, then at the time the Rights
Agent sends a copy of the Milestone

 



      
 

 



 

Notice to the Holders, the Rights Agent will also pay the Payment Amount to
each of the Holders (the amount to which each Holder is entitled to receive
will be the Payment Amount multiplied by the number of CVRs held by such
Holder as reflected on the CVR Register) by check mailed to the address of
each Holder as reflected in the CVR Register as of the close of business on
the date of the Milestone Notice.

 



 

(c) Parent shall be entitled to deduct or withhold, or cause the Rights Agent
to deduct or withhold, from any Payment Amount otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under the Code, the Treasury Regulations thereunder, or any other
applicable Tax Law, as may be determined by Parent or the Rights Agent. Prior
to making any such Tax withholdings or causing any such Tax withholdings to be
made with respect to any Holder, Parent shall instruct the Rights Agent to
solicit IRS Form W-9s from Holders eligible for Tax withholding within a
reasonable amount of time in order to provide the opportunity for the Holder
to provide any necessary Tax forms (including an IRS Form W-9 or an applicable
IRS Form W-8) in order to avoid or reduce such withholding amounts. To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid, and prior to the 15th day of
February in the year following any payment of such taxes by Parent or the
Rights Agent, Parent shall deliver (or shall cause the Rights Agent to
deliver) to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid the
original Form 1099 or other reasonably acceptable evidence of such
withholding.

 



 

(d) Any portion of any Payment Amount that remains undistributed to the
Holders six (6) months after the date of the Milestone Notice will be
delivered by the Rights Agent to Parent, upon demand, and any Holder will
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of such Payment Amount, without
interest, but such Holder will have no greater rights against Parent than
those accorded to general unsecured creditors of Parent under applicable law.

 



 

(e) Neither Parent nor the Rights Agent will be liable to any person in
respect of any Payment Amount delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If, despite Parents
and/or the Rights Agents commercially reasonable efforts to deliver a Payment
Amount to the applicable Holder, such Payment Amount has not been paid
immediately prior to the date on which such Payment Amount would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Payment
Amount will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto. In addition to and not in limitation of any other indemnity
obligation herein, Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Rights Agent
with respect to any liability, penalty, cost or expense Rights Agent may incur
or be subject to in connection with transferring such property to Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

2.5. _No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership Interest in
Parent_.

 



 

(a) The CVRs will not have any voting or dividend rights, and interest will
not accrue on any amounts payable on the CVRs to any Holder.

 



 

(b) The CVRs will not represent any equity or ownership interest in Parent or
in any constituent company to the Merger.

 



 

3. THE RIGHTS AGENT

 



 

3.1. _Certain Duties and Responsibilities_. The Rights Agent will not have any
liability for any actions taken or not taken in connection with this
Agreement, except to the extent of its willful misconduct, bad faith or gross
negligence.

such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this
Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations will be read into this
Agreement against the Rights Agent. In addition:

 



 

(a) the Rights Agent may rely and will be protected and held harmless by
Parent in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate,
statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent,
order or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been
signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

 



 

(b) whenever the Rights Agent will deem it desirable that a matter be proved
or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder,
the Rights Agent may rely upon an Officers Certificate, which certificate
shall be full authorization and protection to the Rights Agent, and the Rights
Agent shall, in the absence of bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct on its part, incur no liability and be held harmless by Parent for
or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it under
the provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon such certificate;

 



 

(c) the Rights Agent may engage and consult with counsel of its selection and
the written advice of such counsel or any opinion of counsel will be full and
complete authorization and protection and shall be held harmless by Parent in
respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith
and in reliance thereon;

 



 

(d) the permissive rights of the Rights Agent to do things enumerated in this
Agreement will not be construed as a duty;

 



 

(e) the Rights Agent will not be required to give any note or surety in
respect of the execution of such powers or otherwise in respect of the
premises;

 



 

(f) the Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of, and shall be
held harmless by Parent with respect to any of the statements of fact or
recitals contained in this Agreement or be required to verify the same, but
all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by
the Parent only;

 



       
 

 



 

(g) the Rights Agent will have no liability and shall be held harmless by
Parent in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and
delivery hereof (except the due execution and delivery hereof by the Rights
Agent and the enforceability of this Agreement against the Rights Agent
assuming the due execution and delivery hereof by Parent); nor shall it be
responsible for any breach by the Parent of any covenant or condition
contained in this Agreement;

 



 

(h) Parent agrees to indemnify Rights Agent for, and hold Rights Agent
harmless against, any loss, liability, claim, demands, suits or expense
arising out of or in connection with Rights Agents duties under this
Agreement, including the costs and expenses of defending Rights Agent against
any claims, charges, demands, suits or loss, unless such loss has been
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be a result of Rights
Agents gross negligence, bad faith or willful or intentional misconduct;

 



 

(i) Rights Agent shall not be liable for consequential damages under any
provision of this Agreement or for any consequential damages arising out of
any act or failure to act hereunder in the absence of bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct on its part;

 



 

(j) Parent agrees (i) to pay the fees and expenses of the Rights Agent in
connection with this Agreement as agreed upon in writing by the Rights Agent
and Parent on or prior to the date hereof, and (ii) to reimburse the Rights
Agent for all taxes and governmental charges, reasonable expenses and other
charges of any kind and nature incurred by the Rights Agent in the execution
of this Agreement (other than taxes imposed on or measured by the Rights
Agents net income and franchise or similar taxes imposed on it (in lieu of
net income taxes)). The Rights Agent will also be entitled to reimbursement
from Parent for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses paid or
incurred by it in connection with the administration by the Rights Agent of
its duties hereunder; and

 



 

(k) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to expend or
risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the
performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if
there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds
or adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not reasonably
assured to it.

 



 

3.3. _Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor_.

 



 

(a) The Rights Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof
to Parent specifying a date when such resignation will take effect, which
notice will be sent at least 60 days prior to the date so specified but in no
event will such resignation become effective until a successor Rights Agent
has been appointed. Parent has the right to remove Rights Agent at any time by
a Board Resolution specifying a date when such removal will take effect but no
such removal will become effective until a successor Rights Agent has been
appointed. Notice of such removal will be given by Parent to Rights Agent,
which notice will be sent at least 60 days prior to the date so specified.

 



 

(b) If the Rights Agent provides notice of its intent to resign, is removed or
becomes incapable of acting, Parent, by a Board Resolution, will as soon as is
reasonably possible

 



      
 

 



 

appoint a qualified successor Rights Agent who, unless otherwise consented to
in writing by the Holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding CVRs,
shall be a stock transfer agent of national reputation or the corporate trust
department of a commercial bank. The successor Rights Agent so appointed will,
forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with Section
3.4, become the successor Rights Agent.

 



 

(c) Parent will give notice of each resignation and each removal of a Rights
Agent and each appointment of a successor Rights Agent by mailing written
notice of such event by first-class mail to the Holders as their names and
addresses appear in the CVR Register. Each notice will include the name and
address of the successor Rights Agent. If Parent fails to send such notice
within ten days after acceptance of appointment by a successor Rights Agent,
the successor Rights Agent will cause the notice to be mailed at the expense
of Parent.

 



 

3.4. _Acceptance of Appointment by Successor_. Every successor Rights Agent
appointed hereunder will execute, acknowledge and deliver to Parent and to the
retiring Rights Agent an instrument accepting such appointment and a
counterpart of this Agreement, and thereupon such successor Rights Agent,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, will become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Rights Agent. On request of
Parent or the successor Rights Agent, the retiring Rights Agent will execute
and deliver an instrument transferring to the successor Rights Agent all the
rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Rights Agent.

 



 

4. COVENANTS

 



 

4.1. _List of Holders_. Parent will furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Rights Agent in such form as Parent receives from the Companys transfer agent
(or other agent performing similar services for the Company), the names and
addresses of the Holders within ten Business Days of the Effective Time.

 



 

4.2. _Payment of Payment Amount_. If the Sales Milestone has been achieved in
accordance with this Agreement, Parent will, promptly following the delivery
of the Milestone Notice, deposit with the Rights Agent, for payment to the
Holders in accordance with Section 2.4, the aggregate amount necessary to pay
the Payment Amount to all Holders. For the avoidance of doubt, the Payment
Amount shall only be paid, if at all, one time under this Agreement.

 



 

4.3. _Books and Records_. Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
keep true, complete and accurate records in sufficient detail to enable the
Holders and their consultants or professional advisors to determine the
amounts payable hereunder.

 



 

4.4. _Audits_.

 



 

(a) Upon the written request of the Acting Holders provided to Parent within
120 days of the date on which the Holders are delivered the final Net Sales
Statement pursuant to Section 2.4(b) of this Agreement (the " _Review Request
Period_ "), Parent shall permit, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to
permit, the Independent Accountant to have access during normal business hours
to such of the records of the Company or other

 



      
 

 



 

applicable Selling Entity as may be reasonably necessary to verify the
accuracy of the Net Sales Statement and the figures underlying the
calculations set forth therein, including, without limitation, all written
materials related to any sale transaction reasonably requested by such
Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall be charged to come to
a final determination with respect to those specific items in the Net Sales
Statement that the parties disagree on and submit to it for resolution. All
other items in the Net Sales Statement that the parties do not submit, prior
to the end of the Review Request Period, to the Independent Accountant for
resolution shall be deemed to be agreed by the parties and the Independent
Accountant shall not be charged with calculating or validating those agreed
upon items. If issues are submitted to the Independent Accountant for
resolution, Parent shall, and shall cause to its controlled Affiliates to,
furnish to the Independent Accountant such access, work papers and other
documents and information related to those disputed issues as the Independent
Accountant may request and as are available to Parent. The Independent
Accountant shall disclose to Parent and the Acting Holders any matters
directly related to their findings to the extent necessary to verify the
accuracy or completeness of the Net Sales Statements. The fees charged by such
accounting firm shall be paid by Parent.

 



 

(b) If the Independent Accountant concludes that a Payment Amount that was
properly due was not paid to the Holders, Parent shall pay to the Rights Agent
(for further distribution to the Holders) or to each Holder the applicable
Payment Amount, plus interest on such Payment Amount at the "prime rate" as
published in the Wall Street Journal or similar reputable data source from
time to time calculated from when the Payment Amount should have been paid (if
Parent had given notice of achievement of the Sales Milestone following its
actual achievement, as determined by the Independent Accountant, at the time
required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement), as applicable, to the date
of actual payment (such amount including interest being the "CVR Shortfall").
The CVR Shortfall shall be paid within ten (10) days of the date the
Independent Accountant delivers to Parent and the Acting Holders the
Independent Accountants written report. The decision of the Independent
Accountant shall be final, conclusive and binding on Parent and the Holders,
shall be non-appealable and shall not be subject to further review.

 



 

(c) If, upon the expiration of the Review Request Period, the Acting Holders
have not requested a review of the Net Sales Statement in accordance with this
Section 4.8, the calculations set forth in the Net Sales Statement shall be
binding and conclusive upon the Holders.

 



 

(d) Each person seeking to receive information from Parent in connection with
a review pursuant to this Section 4.8 shall enter into, and shall cause its
accounting firm to enter into, a reasonable and mutually satisfactory
confidentiality agreement with Parent or any controlled Affiliate obligating
such party to retain all such information disclosed to such party in
confidence pursuant to such confidentiality agreement.

 



 

(e) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, enter into any
license or distribution agreement with any third party (other than Parent or
its Affiliates) with respect to a Product unless such agreement contains
provisions that would allow any

 



      
 

 



 

Independent Accountant appointed pursuant to this Section 4.4 such access to
the records of the other party to such license or distribution agreement as
may be reasonably necessary to perform its duties pursuant to this Section
4.4; _provided_ that Parent and its Affiliates shall not be required to amend
any of its existing licenses. The parties hereto agree that, if Parent or its
Affiliates have exercised audit rights under any license or distribution
agreement prior to the Acting Holders request for an audit under this Section
4.4 and under such license or distribution agreement Parent and its Affiliates
cannot request another audit, the results of Parents prior audit of such
licensee or distributor shall be used for purposes of the audit requested by
the Acting Holders under this Section 4.4 and that Parent shall not have any
further obligation to provide access to an Independent Accountant with respect
to such licensee until such time as Parent may again exercise its rights of
audit under the license agreement with such licensee.

 



 

4.5. _Milestones_. Parent shall, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to,
use Diligent Efforts to achieve the Sales Milestone.

 



 

5. AMENDMENTS

Resolution, and the Rights Agent may enter into one or more amendments hereto
for the purpose of adding, eliminating or changing any provisions of this
Agreement, even if such addition, elimination or change is materially adverse
to the interest of the Holders; provided, however, that no such amendment
shall, without the consent of the Holders of sixty six (66%) percent of the

5.4. _Effect of Amendments_. Upon the execution of any amendment under this

The Rights Agent or Parent may specify a different address or facsimile number
by giving notice in accordance with this Section 6.1.

 



 

6.2. _Notice to Holders_. Where this Agreement provides for notice to Holders,
such notice will be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly
provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each
Holder affected by such event, at the Holders address as it appears in the
CVR Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the
earliest date, if any, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case
where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such
notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder will
affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.

 



 

6.3. _Parent Successors and Assigns_. Parent may assign, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Parent or to any purchaser or licensee of
substantial rights to the Product (each, an " _Assignee_ ") provided that the
Assignee agrees to assume and be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement.
Any such Assignee may thereafter assign, in its sole discretion and without
the consent of any other party, any or all of its rights, interests and
obligations hereunder to one or more additional Assignees who agree to assume
and be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that in
connection with any assignment to an Assignee, Parent and Sub (or the other
assignor) shall agree to remain liable for the performance by each
Assignee(and such other assignor, if applicable) of all obligations of Parent
and Sub hereunder, with such Assignee substituted for Parent and Sub under
this Agreement. This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of
and be enforceable by Parents successors and each Assignee, and this
Agreement shall not restrict Parents, any Assignees or any of their
respective successors ability to merge or consolidate. Each of Parents
successors and assigns shall expressly assume by an instrument supplemental
hereto, executed and delivered to the Rights Agent, the due and punctual
payment of the CVRs and the due and punctual performance and observance of all
of the covenants and obligations of this Agreement to be performed or observed
by Parent.

 



 

6.4. _Benefits of Agreement_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
will give to any Person (other than the Rights Agent, Parent, Parents
successors and assignees, and the Holders) any benefit or any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under this Agreement or under any covenant or
provision herein contained, all such covenants and provisions being for the
sole benefit of the, Rights Agent, Parent, Parents successors and assignees,
and the Holders. The rights of Holders are limited to those expressly provided
in this Agreement and the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, any Holder may agree to renounce, in whole or in
part, such Holders rights under this Agreement by written notice to the
Rights Agent and Parent, which notice, if given, shall be irrevocable.

 



      
 

 



 

6.5. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the CVRs and all actions arising under
or in connection therewith shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof.

 



 

6.6. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree shall remain in
full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. The
parties further agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable provision of
this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to
the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid
or unenforceable provision.

 



 

6.7. _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts (including by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered
by electronic mail), each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other party, it being understood that the parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

 



 

6.8. _Termination_. This Agreement will be terminated and of no force or
effect, the parties hereto will have no liability hereunder (other than with
respect to monies due and owing by Parent to Rights Agent), and no payments
will be required to be made, upon the earlier to occur of (a) the mailing by
the Rights Agent to the address of each Holder as reflected in the CVR
Register the full amount of all potential Payment Amounts required to be paid
under the terms of this Agreement and (b) in the event the Milestone Notice
indicates that the Net Sales Milestone has not been achieved, the expiration
of the Review Request Period, unless there has been a request for an audit
pursuant to Section 4.4 prior to the end of the Review Request Period, in
which case until such audit has been completed and any CVR Shortfall
determined to be payable as a result of such audit, if applicable, has been
paid. In no event will any Payment Amount become payable on account of sales
of the Product consummated prior to January 1, 2016 or after December 31,
2016.

 



 

6.9. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Merger Agreement (including
the schedules, annexes and exhibits thereto and the documents and instruments
referred to therein) contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto
and thereto with reference to the transactions and matters contemplated hereby
and thereby and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, among the
parties with respect hereto and thereto. If and to the extent that any
provision of this Agreement is inconsistent or conflicts with the Merger
Agreement, this Agreement will govern and be controlling.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties has caused this Agreement to be
executed on its behalf by its duly authorized officers as of the day and year
