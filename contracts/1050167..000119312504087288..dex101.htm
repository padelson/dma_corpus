the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet, if any. For purposes of illustration of
this _Section 2.9_ only, assuming the Closing occurs on April 15, 2004 and
the Agreed EBITDA is $17,600,000, the decrease in the value of the Companies
prior to Closing would be determined as follows:

\- 16 - ARTICLE III



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

OF THE COMPANY AND THE SELLERS



The Parent and the Company jointly and severally represent and warrant to
Buyer and Global, jointly and severally with respect to matters relating to
the Company (but not with respect to a member of Parent individually), and
each Seller represents and warrants severally but not jointly with respect to
matters relating to such Seller individually in _Sections 3.1_ and _3.9(a)_ ,
_(d)_ and _(e)_ , that subject to the specific qualifications and limitations
set forth herein, including, without limitation, the qualifications and
limitations set forth in the disclosure schedules delivered by the Parent to
Buyer and Global on the date hereof (the "Disclosure Schedules"), the
statements contained in this _Article III_ are correct and complete as of the
date hereof and will be correct and complete as of the Closing Date (as though
made then and as though the Closing Date were substituted for the date of this
Agreement throughout this  _Article III_ ), except to the extent that such
representations and warranties are expressly made as of another specified
date, and as to such representation, the same shall be true as of such date
and except with respect to factors, circumstances or events, including
execution of contracts or other agreements, first arising or, in the case of
representations given to the Companys Knowledge, such Knowledge being
obtained in good faith after the date hereof; provided that such factors,
circumstances or events do not constitute a breach of any of the Sellers or
Companys covenants pursuant to _Article V_ of this Agreement except as would
not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Disclosure Schedules may be updated
one or more times prior to the Closing Date and the delivery of such updated
Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to have cured any misrepresentation or
breach of warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason of
such variance or inaccuracy and neither Buyer nor Global shall have any claim
(whether for indemnification or otherwise) against the Company or the Sellers
for any such variance or inaccuracy; _provided_ that any such updated
Disclosure Schedules containing any change that would result in any Material
Adverse Effect shall not cure any misrepresentation or breach of warranty of
the Company and Sellers under this _Article III_. The inclusion of any item on
any Disclosure Schedule shall not constitute an admission that such item is
material or that a violation, right of termination, default, liability or
other obligation of any kind exists with respect to such item, but rather is
intended only to qualify certain representations and warranties in this
Agreement and to set forth other information required by this Agreement. The
headings with respect to each item are included for convenience only, and are
not a part of the responses to requirements or a qualification of
the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement. Capitalized
terms used in the Disclosure Schedules but not otherwise defined shall have
the meanings assigned to them in this Agreement. Nothing in the Disclosure
Schedules shall be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a
representation or warranty made herein, unless the Disclosure Schedules
identify the exception with reasonable particularity or the disclosure
manifestly states an exception to a warranty or representation, as the
context requires. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the mere
listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a document or other item shall not be
deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty



 

\- 17 - made herein (unless (i) the representation or warranty had to do with the
existence of the document or other item itself or (ii) the representation and
warranty refers to a specific violation or exception contained in the document
or other item itself, which violation or exception to a representation or
warranty would be reasonably obvious to a reasonable purchaser upon review of
the document or item). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a disclosure on one
schedule would be reasonably obvious to a reasonable purchaser to apply to the
disclosure under another schedule, then such disclosure shall be
sufficient for such other schedule (for example, if the Sellers specifically
disclose on _Schedule 3.12(b)_ an uncollectable Account Receivable that has
not been reserved for on the Financial Statements, such disclosure shall be
sufficient for a disclosure under _Schedule 3.11(b)_ ). The Disclosure
Schedules will be arranged in Schedules corresponding to the lettered and
numbered paragraphs contained in this _Article III_ _._



3.1 _Due Authorization_. The Company and such Seller have all requisite
power, right and authority to execute, deliver and perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and each of the Transaction Documents to
which they are a party. The execution, delivery, and performance of this
Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action of the Company. This Agreement and each of the Transaction Documents to
which the Company and such Seller is a party have been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and such Seller, as applicable, and constitute the
valid and binding obligations of the Company and such Seller, as applicable,
and are enforceable against the Company and such Seller, as applicable, in
accordance with their respective terms, except to the extent that the

moratorium, general equitable principles, or public policy.

rulings, requests for rulings, or closing agreements relating to any of the
Companies which could materially affect any of the Companies liability
for Taxes for any period after the Closing Date. None of the Companies will
be required to take into income for any period on or after the Closing Date
any adjustment under Section 481 of the Code (or any corresponding provision
of state or local Tax law) as a result of any change of accounting method for
a tax period beginning prior to the Closing Date or required by virtue of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(b) Each of the Companies is not, nor has it been since the later of (i) March
12, 1999 or (ii) the date such Subsidiary was, directly or indirectly, formed

consolidated, combined, or unitary group for purposes of filing Tax Returns or
paying Taxes at any time other than with the Company. The Companies do not

999 of the Code. Each of the Companies has not received any written notice of
any foreign income Tax rulings with respect to any of the Companies that
are material to the continuing operations of the Company. As a result of
compliance with this Agreement, none of the Companies will be obligated to
make a payment to an individual that would be a "parachute payment" to a
"disqualified individual" as those terms are defined in Section 280G of the
Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax law)
without regard to whether such payment is to be made in the future.

or lessor, of any real property (each a "Listed Contract," and collectively,

of oral agreements, complete descriptions, previously have been made
available. The Companies are neither in default, nor has any event occurred
that, with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both, would
constitute a default by any of the Companies, under any Listed Contract and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred that, with the giving
of notice or the passage of time, or both would constitute a default by any
other party to any such Listed Contract; provided, however, any defaults, by

from the scope of this representation. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14_

of the Companies have renewed and billed all expired but uncancelled Service
Contracts and has no Knowledge that any customer will not continue to pay and
perform such customers obligations under any Service Contract. Except as

ARTICLE VI



POST-CLOSING COVENANTS



6.1 _General_. In case at any time after the Closing any further action is
legally necessary or reasonably desirable (as determined by Buyer and the
Sellers) to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the Parties will
take such further action (including the execution and delivery of such
further instruments and documents) as any other party reasonably may request,
all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting party (unless the
requesting party is entitled to indemnification therefor under _Article VIII_
below). In addition, the Sellers, the Company, Buyer and Global shall take
all further action as is legally necessary or reasonably desirable (at
Sellers expense) to remove any and all liens and obligations of the Companies
as of the Closing Date, if any, to the Company Lenders. The Parent and Buyer
acknowledge and



 

\- 41 - agree that from and after the Closing, Buyer will be entitled to possession of
all documents, books, records, agreements, and financial data of any sort
relating to the Companies, which shall be maintained at the chief executive
office of the Company; _provided, however,_ that the Parent and the Sellers
shall be entitled to reasonable access to and to make copies of such books
and records at their sole cost and expense, and Buyer will maintain all of the
same for a period of at least six (6) years after the Closing. The Parent and
the Sellers will also extend reasonable cooperation and assistance to
Global after the Closing (at Globals sole cost and expense) in preparing any
financial statements of the Companies or securities reports required to be
made by Global under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the
extent not obtained prior to the Closing, Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the release of the Sellers and any other member
of the Parent, if applicable, from all personal guarantees, if any, with
respect to the Companies.



6.2 _Transition_. Each Seller agrees not to knowingly take any action that
primarily is designed or intended to have the effect of discouraging any
lessor, licensor, customer, supplier, officer, employee or other
business associate of the Companies from maintaining the same business
relations with the Companies after the Closing as it maintained with any of
the Companies prior to the Closing (including, without limitation, interfering
in the Companys business operations). After the Closing, (i) each Seller
agrees not to intentionally make to any customer, supplier, employee or
business relation or affiliate of any of the Companies or the general public
any statement that intentionally and materially disparages Global or its
Subsidiaries (including their respective officers, directors, stockholders and
employees) and (ii) Global agrees not to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, intentionally make to any customer, supplier, employee or business
relation or Affiliate of any of the Sellers or the general public any
statement that intentionally and materially disparages any of the Sellers or
their Affiliates (including their respective officers, directors, stockholders
and employees).



6.3 _Confidentiality_. Following the Closing Date, except as otherwise
permitted in this Agreement, each Seller agrees to (i) treat and hold as such
all Confidential Information and (ii) refrain from using any of the
Confidential Information except in connection with this Agreement, including
enforcement of its rights under the Transaction Documents, as an employee of
the Company, or otherwise for the benefit of the Company, Buyer or their
respective affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent and the
Sellers may disclose the basic terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to the equityholders of the Parent and its affiliates to the extent
such information is customarily provided to such equityholders in the ordinary
course of business. In the event that a Seller is requested or required (by
oral question or written request for information or documents in any legal
proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar
legal proceeding) to disclose any Confidential Information, such Seller will
notify Buyer promptly of the request or requirement.



6.4 _Covenant Not to Compete_. Without any allocation of the Purchase Price
paid to the Sellers by Buyer, each Seller (other than Allstate Insurance
Company) covenants and agrees, for a period of three (3) years from and after
the Closing Date, that he or it will not intentionally, directly or indirectly
without the prior written consent of Buyer, for himself or on behalf of
any entity:



 

\- 42 - (a) become interested or engaged, as a stockholder, bondholder, creditor,
officer, director, partner, agent, contractor with, employer or
representative of, or give financial, technical or other assistance to, any
Person, firm or corporation, in each case primarily for the purpose of
engaging in the Business in competition with any of the Companies within the
greater of (i) a 100 mile radius of any of the Companies current retail
service locations, or (ii) in any geographic area in the States of California,
Texas, Arizona, Washington and/or Oregon in which any of the
Companies currently conducts business (the "Current Trade Area");



(b) enter into any agreement with, service, assist or solicit the business of
any customers of the Companies, Global or any of their respective affiliates
primarily for the purpose of providing retail office equipment sales or
service to such customers in competition with the Business in the Current
Trade Area or to intentionally cause such customers to reduce or end their
business with the Companies; or



(c) enter into any agreement with, or solicit the employment of, employees of
the Companies for the purpose of causing them to leave the employment of the
Companies;



The foregoing shall in no event limit or prevent any Seller from being the
owner of less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of any publicly-
traded corporation.



6.5 _Additional Tax Matters_.



(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall engage Ernst and Young (or
other accounting firm of national standing reasonably acceptable to Buyer) to
prepare all federal, state and local income Tax Returns with respect to all
periods ending on or before the Effective Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Periods")
that have not been filed as of the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice except as otherwise
required by applicable law, and shall utilize accounting methods, elections
and conventions that do not have the effect of distorting the allocation of
income or expense between Pre-Closing Tax Periods and periods ending after the
Closing Date. The Company shall deliver a draft of any such Tax Return to
Parent for Parents review and comment at least 15 days prior to the due date
for the filing of such Tax Return (or if earlier, 15 days prior to the filing
date thereof). Buyer, the Company and Parent shall cooperate to resolve any
disagreement they may have regarding whether such Tax Return has been
prepared in accordance with the prior practice of the Company (or, where no
past practice has been established for an item, whether such item has been
reported in a manner better supported by applicable law than any other
manner). The Parents consent shall not be required for the Company to file
the Tax Return (or for Buyer to cause the Tax Return to be filed) as Buyer
deems appropriate, but if the Parent delivers a written statement to Buyer no
more than 10 days after receiving a Tax Return for review and comment, which
written statement sets forth the Parents objections to the Tax Return as
proposed to be filed by the Company and Buyer, the Parent and the Buyer shall
(following the filing of such Tax Return as prepared (or as caused to be
prepared) by the Buyer) submit the dispute over the items specified in such
written statement to the Independent Accountants. The Parent and the Buyer
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent
Accountants to resolve such disputed items as soon as practicable, subject to
the standard that items for which a past



 

\- 43 - practice has been established by the Company shall be determined in accordance
with such past practice except as otherwise required by applicable law and
that all other items shall be determined in a manner better supported by
applicable law than any other manner. If the Independent Accountants
determines that one or more disputed items should have been determined (based
on the standard set forth in the immediately preceding sentence) in a manner
different from the manner in which such item or items were reported on the Tax
Return as actually filed, then the amount of Tax liabilities and Tax
assets to be reflected in the Closing Statement Review shall be determined
with reference to the amounts that would have been reflected on such Tax
Return had such Tax Return been prepared and filed in accordance with the
Independent Accountants determination, as opposed to the amounts reflected
on such Tax Return as actually prepared and filed. The resolution of any
dispute by the Independent Accountants pursuant to this Section 6.5(a) shall
be final, binding and non-appealable on the parties hereto. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accountants shall be shared 50% by Buyer and
Global, jointly and severally, and 50% by Parent. The Company shall, and Buyer
shall cause the Company, to pay all Taxes shown as due on any Tax Return
filed pursuant to this Section 6.5(a).



(b) Buyer, the Parent and the Sellers recognize that each of them will need
access, from time to time, after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and
Tax records and information held by Buyer and/or the Company to the extent
such records and information pertain to events occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date; therefore, Buyer agrees to cause the Company to (A) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to properly retain and maintain such records
for a period of six (6) years from the date the Tax Returns for the year in
which the Closing occurs are filed or until the expiration of the statute of
limitations with respect to such year, whichever is later, and (B) allow the
Parent, the Sellers and their agents and representatives at times and dates
mutually acceptable to the parties, to reasonably inspect, review and make
copies of such records from time to time, such activities to be conducted
during normal business hours and at the Parents or Sellers expense, as
appropriate with respect to out-of-pocket expenses.



(c) If, subsequent to the Closing, Buyer or the Companies receives notice of a
Tax Contest with respect to any Tax Return for a periods or portions thereof
beginning prior to the Closing Date that reasonably could be expect to have
an adverse impact on the Parents indemnification obligations under this
Agreement, then within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, Buyer
shall notify the Parent of such notice. Buyer shall have the right to control
the conduct and resolution of any such Tax Contest, provided, however, that
the Parent shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution of the
portion of such Tax Contest that that reasonably could be expect to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Parents indemnification obligations under
this Agreement to the extent that such indemnification obligations would not
be covered by the Escrow Sum, provided, however, that if any of the issues
raised in such Material Tax Contest could reasonably be expected to have a
material impact on Taxes of the Companies for a Tax period or portion thereof
beginning on or after the Closing Date (a "Post-Closing Tax Period"), then the
Parent shall afford Buyer the opportunity to control jointly the conduct and
resolution of the portion of such Tax Contest with respect to such issues that
could reasonably be expected to have a material impact on Taxes of the
Companies in any Post-Closing Tax Period. If Buyer shall have the right to
control the conduct



 

\- 44 - and resolution of any Tax Contest that reasonably could be expect to have an
adverse impact on the Parents indemnification obligations under this
Agreement (whether because the Parent shall have the right to control the
conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest but either elects in writing not to
do so or otherwise fails to do so or otherwise), then Buyer shall keep the
Parent informed of all developments on a timely basis and Buyer shall not
resolve such Tax Contest in a manner that could reasonably be expected to have
an adverse impact on the Parents indemnification obligations under this
Agreement without the Parents written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld. If Buyer shall have the right to control the conduct
and resolution of such Tax Contest but either elects in writing not to do so
or otherwise fails to do so, then the Parent shall have the right to control
the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest, provided that the Parent shall
keep Buyer informed of all developments on a timely basis and the Parent shall
not resolve such Tax Contest in a manner that could reasonably be expected to
have a material impact on Taxes of the Companies in any Post-Closing Tax
Period without Buyers written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Each party shall bear its own costs for participating in such Tax
Contest. "Tax Contest" means any audit, other administrative proceeding or
inquiry or judicial proceeding involving Taxes.



(d) No Tax Return of the Company filed with respect to periods ending before,
or including, the Closing Date shall be amended after the Closing Date if
such amendment reasonably could be expected to have a material adverse impact
on the Parents indemnification obligations under this Agreement without
Parents consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.



(e) Except to the extent included as an asset in the Working Capital
reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet or as provided in the next sentence
below, all refunds of Taxes received by Buyer or the Companies, and all
amounts credited against Taxes to which Buyer and the Companies become
entitled, with respect to Taxes paid by the Parent, the Sellers or the Company
for periods (or portions thereof, determined in accordance with Section
6.5(b)) ending on or before the Closing Date shall be paid over to the
Parent within ten (10) Business Days of receipt or crediting by Buyer or the
Companies thereof. The amount of any Tax refund or credit that may be payable
to the Parent pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not include any portion
of such refund or credit that is attributable to any loss, credit, deduction,
or other amount that arises in or is attributable to any period (or portion
thereof) after the Closing Date, nor shall Buyer or the Companies have any
obligation to seek or take any action or position in order to create,
increase, or obtain any refund or reduction of the amount of Taxes paid by the
Parent, the Sellers or the Companies for any period.



6.6 _Agreement to Register Stock_.



(a) (i) Within three (3) Business Days following the date hereof, Global shall
prepare and file a registration statement on Form S-3 (the "Resale
Registration Statement") under the Securities Act covering the resale of the
Global Stock to be issued as the Stock Portion of the Purchase Price (and any
shares of the capital stock of Global that may be issued with respect to the
Global Stock as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, dividend,
stock split or comparable event). Prior to the filing of the Resale
Registration Statement, Global shall provide the Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to comment and shall use commercially



 

\- 45 - reasonable efforts to incorporate any reasonable comments timely provided by
the Parent in the Resale Registration Statement subject to any applicable
Requirements of Laws. Global shall thereafter use its reasonable best efforts
to have such Resale Registration Statement declared effective by the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") as soon after the filing as
practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days (assuming the SEC informs
Global that it will not review the Resale Registration Statement or the
documents incorporated by reference therein) and to keep that
Resale Registration Statement effective and current, including through the
filing of any amendments and supplements that may be required under provisions
of applicable law, for one year after its original effectiveness or such
shorter period of time during which all shares of Global Stock covered by the
resale Registration Statement have been sold thereunder. Global may not
include other shares of Globals Stock on the Resale Registration Statement.
At Globals option, Global may satisfy its obligations under this _Section
5.1(a)_ on another form of registration statement under the Securities Act to
the extent Form S-3 is not then currently available to Global.



(ii) Global agrees to notify each holder of Global Stock registered on the
Resale Registration Statement (i) when the Resale Registration Statement (or
any post-effective amendment thereto) has become effective, (ii) if the SEC
has issued any stop order with respect to the Resale Registration Statement or
initiated any proceedings for that purpose, and (iii) if Global has received
any written notification with respect to the suspension of qualification of
any Global Stock for sale in any jurisdiction or any securities exchange or
market or with respect to the initiation or threat of any proceeding for
such purpose. Global shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
withdrawal, at the earliest practicable time (after any period described in
Section 6.6(b)), of (i) any order suspending the effectiveness of the Resale
Registration Statement, (ii) any order preventing or suspending the use of a
prospectus or (iii) any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from
qualification) of any of the Global Stock for offer or sale in any
jurisdiction, _provided_ , _however_ , that to obtain the withdrawal of any
suspension of the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of
the Global Stock Global shall not be required to (x) qualify generally to do
business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified or (y) take
any action which would subject it to general service of process or to taxation
in excess of a nominal amount in any jurisdiction where it is not then so
subject.



(iii) Upon the occurrence of any event that requires Global to make changes in
the Resale Registration Statement or the prospectus so that, as of such date,
neither the Resale Registration Statement nor the related prospectus contains
an untrue statement of a material fact nor omits to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in
the case of the related prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made) not misleading, Global shall, (subject to the periods
permissible under Section 6.6(b)) promptly prepare and file a post-
effective amendment to the Resale Registration Statement or an amendment or
supplement to the related prospectus, as the case may be, so that, as
thereafter delivered to holders of Global Stock registered on the Resale
Registration Statement, the Resale Registration Statement and the related
prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of the related prospectus, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading.



 

\- 46 - (iv) Global further agrees to furnish holders of Global Stock registered on
the Resale Registration Statement such numbers of copies of a prospectus, in
conformity with the requirements of applicable law, any amendment or
supplement to such prospectus, and such other documents as each such holder
may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Global
Stock owned by such holder.



(b) The Parent and the Sellers shall not (and shall cause each holder of
Global Stock registered on the Resale Registration Statement to not) effect
any public sale or distribution (including sales pursuant to Rule 144 under
the Securities Act) of Global Stock during any one or more periods not to
exceed 45 days in any three-month period and not to exceed, in the aggregate,
90 days in any 12-month period in which Global notifies such holders of Global
Stock registered on the Resale Registration Statement not to effect any
public sale or distribution of such securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such restriction may only be applied to the holders of such Global Stock if
all other holders of Global Stock registered pursuant to a registration
statement covering the resale of Global Stock are restricted during such
period from effecting any public sale or distribution of Global Stock. The
Parent and the Sellers further expressly agree that they shall (and
shall cause each holder of Global Stock registered on the Resale Registration
Statement to) maintain in confidence the fact of Globals delivery of notice
that no public shares or distributions shall be made. The Parent and the
Sellers agree to comply with the provisions of the Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder relating to stock
manipulation, including Regulation M.



(c) At any time when a prospectus relating to the Resale Registration
Statement is required to be delivered under applicable law, Global will give
notice to any holder of Global Stock registered on the Resale Registration
Statement of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus
included in such Resale Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes
an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances then existing. Any such holder
shall cease using such prospectus immediately upon receipt of notice from
Global to that effect and shall maintain in confidence the fact of Globals
having delivered such notice until such time as Global has supplemented or
amended the prospectus as described below. At the request of such holder,
Global shall prepare and furnish to each holder a reasonable number of copies
of a supplement to an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so
that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such securities, such
prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances
then existing.



(d) (i) Global shall bear all costs incurred in preparing and filing the
Resale Registration Statement including, without limitation, all applicable
legal, accounting, printing, blue sky and SEC filing fees, _provided,
however,_ that Global shall not be responsible for any
underwriting commissions or discounts, brokerage fees or legal fees or
disbursements incurred by any person or entity (other than Global) that sells
any shares of Global Stock under the Resale Registration Statement. Global
shall also bear all costs of keeping the Resale Registration Statement
current during the applicable period described in _Section 6.6(a)_.



 

\- 47 - (ii) Global will indemnify and hold harmless each holder of Global Stock
registered on the Resale Registration Statement against any losses, claims,
damages or liabilities to which such holder may become subject under the
Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Resale Registration
Statement, as supplemented or amended, any final prospectus contained therein,
as supplemented or amended, or any amendment or supplement thereof,
as supplemented or amended, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; _provided,
however,_ that (i) Global will not be liable in any such case if and to the
extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is
based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission so made in conformity with information furnished by such
holder in writing specifically for use in the Resale Registration Statement or
prospectus; (ii) Global shall not be liable to any such holder that uses the
Resale Registration Statement or related prospectus during a period when a
stop order has been issued in respect of such Resale Registration Statement or
any proceedings for that purpose have been initiated, _provided_ that, in any
such case, Global has provided notice thereof to such holder within
a reasonable period of time prior to the use by such holder of the Resale
Registration Statement or related prospectus; and (iii) Global shall not be
liable to any such holder with respect to any untrue statement or omission or
alleged untrue statement or omission made in any prospectus relating to the
Resale Registration to the extent that prior to such holders use of such
prospectus Global notified such holder that such prospectus included an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading
in light of the circumstances then existing.



(iii) Each such holder of Global Stock registered on the Resale Registration
Statement shall furnish to Global in writing such information with respect to
such holder as Global may reasonably request or as may be required by law for
use in connection with the Resale Registration Statement and the final
prospectus contained therein, and each such holder will indemnify, severally
and not jointly, and hold harmless Global against any losses, claims, damages
or liabilities to which Global may become subject under the Securities Act or
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of
or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any
material fact contained in the Resale Registration Statement, any final
prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise
out of or are based upon the omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from Global to the
holders of Global Stock registered on the Resale Registration Statement, but
only with respect to any such information with respect to such holder
furnished in writing to Global expressly for use therein; _provided, however,_
that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the total
amount to be indemnified by such holder under this _Section 6.6(c)(iii)_ shall
be limited to the net proceeds received by such holder in the offering to
which the Resale Registration Statement or prospectus relates.



 

\- 48 - (e) Without the consent of Global, the rights described in this _Section 6.6_
shall not be transferable and shall not be afforded to any person or entity
to whom the Global Shares are transferred, except that such rights may be
transferred with the Global Shares without such consent to persons who (1)
execute a Selling Stockholder Notice in the form attached as _Exhibit J_
hereto, (2) receive the Global Shares in a transaction effected in compliance
with the requirements of the Equity Subscription Agreement, and (3) (A) are
members of the Parent or (B) receive the Global Shares from such a member or
from the Parent in a transaction in which the transferor transfers at least
50% of the Global Shares initially received by it from Global or the Parent,
as applicable.



6.7 _Shut Down Costs_. After the Closing, Global and Buyer shall take
reasonable measures to minimize the amount of any Shut Down Costs and, to the
extent that the Companies had not entered into binding commitments with
respect to any particular Shut Down Cost prior to the Closing, Global and
Buyer shall obtain the Parents consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) with respect to any Shut Down Cost that individually or
in the aggregate exceeds $100,000. In the event that Buyer or the Companies
reasonably determine that the Companies are not obligated to pay any Sellers
Closing Costs or Shut Down Costs within 18 months following the Closing Date
which have reduced the Cash Portion of the Purchase Price pursuant to _Article
II_ , such amounts shall be paid to the Parent promptly in cash after such
determination is made.



6.8 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_. For a period of six
(6) years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any provision
in the Companies Organizational Documents or Governing Documents relating to
the exculpation or indemnification of former officers and directors (unless
otherwise required by law), it being the intent of the Parties that the
officers and directors of the Companies prior to the Closing shall continue
to be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law. For a period of six (6) years after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
to, maintain director and officer liability insurance, which insurance shall
provide coverage for the individuals who were officers and director of the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, comparable to the
policy or policies maintained by the Companies immediately prior to the
Closing Date to the maximum extent such policies may be so maintained, for no
more than an annual cost of 300% of the cost for the year ended December 31,
2003. All estimated costs of procuring such insurance (to the extent not
obtained or paid by the Companies prior to the Effective Date) shall be deemed
to be Shut Down Costs.

Seller, individually and not joint and severally, shall indemnify and hold
harmless Global and Buyer and each officer, director and affiliate of Global
and Buyer, including without limitation the Company or any successor of the
Company (each, a "Buyer Indemnified Party" and collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all damages, losses, claims,
liabilities, demands, charges, suits, penalties, costs and expenses (including
court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses incurred in
investigating and preparing for any litigation or proceeding) other than
consequential, special and indirect damages (collectively, the "Indemnifiable
Costs"), which any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties sustains, or to which any
of the Buyer Indemnified Parties is subjected, arising out of any
misrepresentation or breach by such Seller under any of the individual
representations in _Sections 3.1_ and _3.9(a), (d) and (e)_ ,
covenants, conditions, agreements or other provisions of this Agreement or
any agreement or document executed in connection herewith with respect to such

_Section 8.5_ , the Parent and the Sellers, jointly and severally shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any
and all Indemnifiable Costs which any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties
sustains, or to which any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties is subjected,
arising out of (A) any misrepresentations or breach by the Company (and not
with respect to a particular member of Parent) of or under any of the
representations, covenants, conditions, agreements or other provisions of
this Agreement or any Transaction Document executed in connection herewith;
(B) any liability against the Companies or any of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties to (i) any other party to a Dealer Agreement or (ii) any party to an
equipment leasing arrangement with a leasing company (other than the DLL
Leasing Agreement or any related agreement with DLL or other agreement with
DLL listed on _Schedule 3.9 or 3.14_ ) or one of the Companies customers for
claims by such other party involving the breach of any such agreement or any
Requirements of Laws in connection with any such agreement; to the extent not
listed on _Schedule 3.18_ , based upon facts occurring prior to Closing which
form the alleged basis for any litigation, but only (i) if the primary claim
of any such dispute or litigation with such other party to a Dealer Agreement
or an equipment leasing agreement is the breach of any such agreement or any
Requirements of Laws in connection with any such agreement prior to the
Closing by the Companies (i.e. not primarily based on circumstances affecting
the relationship with such third party after the Closing) and (ii) to the
extent it should have been, but was not, reserved for or reflected in
the Financial Statements; (C) any obligation or uncollected amounts actually
due by the Companies pursuant to a recourse lease or guaranty entered into by
the Company or the Sellers on or prior to the Closing Date, whether or not
disclosed on the Disclosure Schedules, but only to the extent not reserved
for or reflected in the Financial Statements or the final and binding Closing

against the Company, whether known at the time of signing of the Agreement or

representative thereof for Unclaimed Property except as reserved for or
reflected in the Financial Statements. This indemnification is expressly
intended to apply notwithstanding any negligence (whether sole, concurrent,
active or passive) or other fault or strict liability on the part of the
Buyer.



(b) _Indemnification of the Parent and the Sellers._ Except as provided in
_Section 8.5_ , Buyer and Global (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnifying
Parties")



 

\- 54 - agree to jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Parent, the
Sellers and each officer, director, partner, member and affiliate of the
Parent and the Sellers (other than the Companies after the Closing) (each, a
"Seller Indemnified Party" and collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties"
and together with the Buyer Indemnified Parties, each an "Indemnified Party"
and collectively the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all
Indemnifiable Costs, which any of the Seller Indemnified Parties sustains, or
to which any of the Seller Indemnified Parties is subjected (whether or not
brought by a third party) arising out of (A) any misrepresentation or breach
by Buyer and/or Global of or under any of the warranties, representations,
covenants, conditions, agreements or other provisions of this Agreement or
any Transaction Document executed in connection herewith; or (B) any claim or
liability against any of the Seller Indemnified Parties by any Person based
upon facts occurring or arising after the Closing Date and unrelated to acts
or omissions of the Sellers prior to the Closing Date. This indemnification is
expressly intended to apply notwithstanding any negligence (whether sole,
concurrent, active or passive) or other fault or strict liability on the part
of the Sellers.



(c)  _Exceptions_. Claims made by one Party against the other Party pursuant
to _Sections 2.6, 2.7, 2.8_ and/or _2.9_ shall not be subject to any of the
provisions or the limitations set forth in _Section 8.5_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no Seller Indemnified Party or Buyer Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to make any claim under this _Article VIII_ to the extent, but
only to such extent, that the item for which such claim was made resulted in a
Purchase Price adjustment pursuant to _Sections 2.6, 2.7, 2.8_ or _2.9_ that
was paid in full by the other Party or had the result of actually decreasing
or increasing the Purchase Price.



8.2 _Defense of Claims_.



(a) If any legal proceeding shall be instituted, or any claim or demand made,
against any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as
applicable, in respect of which the Parent, any Seller or the Buyer
Indemnifying Parties, as applicable (each, an "Indemnifying Party"), may be
liable hereunder (except for a proceeding or claim regarding Taxes, which
shall be governed by _Section 6.5(c)_ ), such Indemnified Party shall give
prompt written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party, and in any event
within ten (10) Business Days after receiving any written notice from
any third party describing in reasonable particularity the claim and the
basis thereof; _provided_ that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party
in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from
any obligation hereunder, unless, and then solely to the extent that, the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. Once the Indemnified Party
has given notice of the matter to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to defend any litigation, action, suit, demand, or
claim for which such Indemnified Party may seek indemnification and such
Indemnified Party shall extend reasonable cooperation in connection with such
defense, which shall be at the Indemnifying Partys expense.



(b) In the event the Indemnifying Parties fail or refuse to defend the same
within a reasonable length of time, the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to assume the defense thereof, and the Indemnifying Parties shall be liable to
repay the Indemnified Parties for all reasonable expenses incurred in
connection with said defense (including reasonable attorneys fees and
settlement payments) if it is determined that such request for indemnification
was proper.



 

\- 55 - (c) If the Indemnifying Parties shall not have the right to assume the defense
of any litigation, action, suit, demand, or claim in accordance with clause
(b) above, the Indemnified Parties shall have the absolute right to control
the defense of and to settle, with the consent of the Indemnifying Parties,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, such litigation, action,
suit, demand, or claim; _provided that_ Parent shall have the absolute right
to settle any and all claims to the extent that payment for such claim is made
solely from the Escrow Sum.



(d) The Indemnified Parties shall be entitled, at their own expense, to
participate in such litigation, action, suit, demand, or claim to the extent
practicable.



8.3 _Escrow Claim_. Following the Closing and through the date of the Escrow
Sum has been exhausted for fully released, if any claim for indemnification
other than Individual Obligations is made by an Indemnified Party pursuant to
this _Article VIII_ prior to the expiration of the Escrow Period, such
Indemnified Party shall first apply to the Escrow Agent for reimbursement of
such claim in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. Thereafter, the Buyer Indemnified Parties may have recourse against
Parent and Sellers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement subject to the
limitations contained in this Agreement.



8.4 _Offsets Against Indemnification._ The amount of any Indemnifiable Costs
for which indemnification is provided under this _Article VIII_ (a) shall be
reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit realized (in the form of a Tax
refund, reduction in Taxes payable, or credit against Taxes payable), and
shall be increased to take account of any net Tax detriment realized, arising
from the incurrence or payment of any such Indemnifiable Costs or from the
receipt of any such indemnification payment and (b) shall be reduced by the
insurance proceeds received and any other net amount, if any, recovered from
third parties, pursuant to acquisition agreements with the Companies or
otherwise, by any Indemnified Party (or its Affiliates) with respect to any
Indemnifiable Costs. If a Party that has received a payment for an
Indemnifiable Cost realizes a Tax benefit after such payment has been
received, and such Tax benefit was not previously netted against such payment,
such Party shall promptly pay over to the Party that made the payment an
amount equal to the amount of such Tax benefit. If any Indemnified Party shall
have received any indemnification payment pursuant to this _Article VIII_ with
respect to any Indemnifiable Costs, such Indemnified Party shall,
upon written request by the Indemnifying Party, assign to such Indemnifying
Party (to the extent of the indemnification payment) any claim which such
Indemnified Party may have under any applicable insurance policy or other
agreement which provides coverage for such Indemnifiable Costs to the extent
of such indemnification payment, to the extent such assignment is permissible
(and if not permissible, the Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts at the Indemnifying Partys expense to recover such
amounts on behalf of the Indemnifying Party). Such Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate (at the expense of the Indemnifying Party) to collect
under such insurance policy or agreement prior to or contemporaneously with
seeking indemnification against an Indemnifying Party. If any Indemnified
Party shall have received any payment



 

\- 56 - pursuant to this _Article VIII_ with respect to any Indemnifiable Costs and
has or shall subsequently have received insurance proceeds or other amounts
with respect to such Indemnifiable Costs, then such Indemnified Party shall
promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered (after
deducting the amount of the expenses incurred by it in procuring such
recovery and any Tax detriment realized), but not in excess of the amount
previously so paid by the Indemnifying Party. __



8.5 _Limits on Indemnification_. Regardless of any investigation at any time
made by or on behalf of any party hereto or of any information any party may
have in respect thereof, all covenants, agreements, representations, and
warranties and the related indemnities made hereunder or pursuant hereto or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall survive the Closing
for a period of eighteen (18) months, provided (a) the representations,
warranties and covenants contained in _Sections 3.1 (Due Authorization), 3.6
(Capital Stock; Title to Shares), 3.7 (Convertible Securities, Options, Etc.),

(Additional Tax Matters), and 6.7 (Shut Down Costs)_ and _Article VIII_ of
this Agreement, and the related indemnities, as well as the right to make any
claim for fraud, shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the
applicable statutes of limitations for determining or contesting tort or
contract claims, Tax liabilities or fraud, as the case may be; provided,
however, that the indemnities provided in _Section 8.1(a)(B)_ , _(C)_ or _(D)_
shall in any event expire no later than the fourth anniversary of the Closing
Date, (b) the representations, warranties and covenants contained in _Sections
3.2 (Title to Shares), and 3.4(b) and (c) (Subsidiaries)_ of this Agreement,
and the related indemnities, shall survive the Closing indefinitely and not
expire, and (c) all other covenants set forth in _Article VI_ which have
specific expiration terms as set forth herein shall expire as of the dates set
forth therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any indemnification claims made
prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations or period
set forth in the preceding sentence, shall continue after such date until
finally resolved. The Sellers shall not be obligated to pay any amounts for
indemnification under this  _Article VIII_ (other than Individual
Obligations) until the aggregate indemnification obligations hereunder exceeds
$1,000,000 (the "Deductible") (Purchase Price adjustments pursuant to
_Sections 2.6, 2.7, 2.8_ and  _2.9_ and any liability pursuant to _Section
6.5, 6.6_ or _6.7_ shall not be included in the calculation of the Deductible,
whereupon the Sellers shall be liable for all amounts for which
indemnification may be sought solely to the extent in excess of the
Deductible. For purposes of _Section 8.1_ or _8.5_ , any requirement in any
representation or warranty of Parent or the Company that an event or fact be
material or have a Material Adverse Effect, as appropriate, in order for such
event or fact to constitute a misrepresentation or breach of such
representation or warranty shall be ignored; _provided, however,_ that no
individual claim involving less than $25,000 or series of related claims
involving less than $50,000 may be sought for indemnification by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties and any such small claims shall not be applied to the
Deductible or the Primary Cap. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall the aggregate liability of the Sellers hereunder (including _Sections
2.7_ and _2.8_ ) exceed $4,000,000 (the "Primary Cap") (except for any claims
for breach of the representations, warranties and covenants of the Sellers
under _Sections 3.1(Due Authorization), 3.2 (Title to Shares), 3.4(b) or (c)
(Subsidiaries), 3.6 (Capital Stock; Title to Shares), 3.7 (Convertible
Securities, Options, Etc.), 3.13 (Taxes), 3.25_



 

\- 57 - _(Employee Benefits), 6.4 (Covenant Not to Compete), 6.5 (Additional Tax
Matters)_ and the indemnity provisions of  _Sections 8.1(a)(B) or (D)_ and
any claims for fraud). In no event shall the aggregate liability of the Parent
and the Sellers to Buyer Indemnified Parties for breaches of _Section
8.1(a)(B)_ and _(D)_ in the aggregate exceed the amount equal to (x)
$12,000,000 less (y) the aggregate amount of claims paid by Sellers under the
Primary Cap. In no event shall the aggregate liability of (i) the Parent and
the Sellers to the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this Agreement and
the Transaction Documents or Buyer and/or Global to any Seller Indemnified
Party for indemnification under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents
exceed $50,000,000 (the "Cap") other than claims for fraud and (ii) any Member
to the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents exceed such members pro rata share of the Cap based on
such Members share of the Purchase Price (excluding Funded Indebtedness) as
if such amount was distributed to the Members immediately following the
Closing pursuant to the terms of the Parents Organizational Documents and
Governing Documents and further provided that such individual portion of the
Cap shall not exceed the amount of the Purchase Price actually distributed to
such Member or its transferees (this clause (ii), their "Pro Rata
Limitation"). However, nothing in this _Article VIII_ shall limit Buyer or the
Sellers in exercising or securing any remedies or in the amount of damages
that it can recover from the Sellers or Buyer in the event that Buyer or the
Sellers successfully prove fraud by the other in connection with this
Agreement, including the Financial Statements or the Disclosure Schedules
attached hereto; provided, however, that (i) no particular member of Parent
shall be liable for the fraud of any other member of Parent and (ii) no
particular member of Parent shall be liable for more than their Pro Rata
Limitation for any fraud committed by Parent and/or the Companies unless
Buyer successfully proves fraud by such member of Parent. Any settlement of a
claim brought against an Indemnified Party must be consented to in writing by
the Indemnified Party, and such consent shall not unreasonably be withheld,
_provided, however,_ that the Parent shall have the absolute right to settle
any and all claims to the extent that payment for such claim is made solely
from the Escrow Sum. Neither Buyer nor the Sellers shall be liable for
punitive damages pursuant to any claim made by another party to this
Agreement.



8.6 _Other Limitations Regarding Indemnification_.



 

(a) To the extent that any breach of a representation, warranty or covenant
made by the Sellers is capable of remedy or cure, Global shall, and shall
cause each other Buyer Indemnified Party to, afford the Seller Indemnifying
Party thirty (30) days to remedy or cure the breach and provide to the Seller
Indemnifying Party all reasonable assistance (including access to buildings,
offices, records, files, properties and assets) in connection with such
remedy or cure. Global shall take, and shall cause each other Buyer
Indemnified Party to take, reasonable measures to mitigate the consequences of
any breach giving rise to an indemnification obligation of the Seller
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement. Conversely, to the extent that any
breach of a representation, warranty or covenant made by Global or Buyer is
capable of remedy or cure, the Sellers shall, and shall cause each other
Seller Indemnified Party to, afford the Buyer Indemnifying Party thirty (30)
days to remedy or cure the breach and provide to the Buyer Indemnifying Party
all reasonable assistance (including access to buildings, offices,
records, files, properties and assets) in connection with such remedy or
cure. Sellers shall take, and shall cause each other Seller Indemnified Party
to take, reasonable measures to mitigate the consequences of any breach giving
rise to an indemnification obligation of the Buyer Indemnifying Party under
this Agreement.



 

\- 58 - (b) With respect to any claim relating to environmental matters in which any
Buyer Indemnified Party (including, without limitation, the Company) is
required under applicable Environmental Law or other laws to initiate or
conduct a response action, the Indemnifying Party shall only be responsible to
provide indemnification with respect to the most economically reasonable
response action required under such Environmental Law. A claim arising out of
offsite disposal that is resolved through agreement, settlement or consent
among a group of potentially responsible parties with the appropriate
governmental authority shall be deemed economically reasonable as long as it
affects other similarly situated parties similarly to the Buyer Indemnified
Parties. The Indemnifying Party shall have the option to observe and approve
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) any response action and Buyer
and Global shall, and shall cause the Buyer Indemnified Parties (including,
without limitation, the Company) to, provide the Indemnifying Party and their
agents and representatives reasonable assistance, including access to any
affected real property, to observe the response action. To the extent any
Buyer Indemnified Party elects to implement a response action that is not
economically reasonable (in Globals reasonable determination), any excess
expense relating to the response action shall be borne by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties and not the Indemnifying Party.



(c) In computing the amount of any indemnification to which a Buyer
Indemnified Party may be entitled by virtue of a breach of (i) _Section 3.11_
based on the amount of assets or liabilities reflected in the financial
statements referred to therein or (ii) _Section 3.17_ based on the list of
certain assets over $25,000, if the amount of any liabilities has been
understated, or unrecorded, or assets overstated on the one hand, but on the
other hand the amount of any other liabilities has been overstated or any
assets understated only the net effect (benefit or detriment) of such errors
shall be taken into account.



(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, to
the extent of any indemnification payments to any Indemnified Party with
respect to any particular Indemnifiable Costs, no recovery for such amount may
be made by any of the other Indemnified Parties from any of the Indemnifying
Parties in respect thereof and no additional recovery for such amount may be
made by any Indemnified Party under this Agreement (including any arising
pursuant to CERCLA or otherwise in respect of environmental, health or safety
matters) (to avoid duplicate recovery).



(e) With respect to any claim for indemnification which is a joint and
several obligation of the Seller Indemnifying Parties including any claim
under the second sentence of _Section 8.1(a)_ above, Buyer and Global shall in
good faith make such claim and the collection thereof first against all
Sellers prior to asserting such joint and several claim against any individual
Member or group of Members.



8.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for claims for fraud, an action for damages
under this _Article VIII_ constitutes the sole and exclusive remedy of the
parties with respect to money damages regarding claims made under this
Agreement, and each party hereby irrevocable waives and releases the other
from any and all claims and other causes of action relating to money damages
regarding the provisions of this Agreement.



 

\- 59 - 8.8 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Any payment under this _Article VIII_
shall be treated for tax purposes as an adjustment of the Purchase Price to
the extent such characterization is proper and permissible under relevant Tax
authorities, including court decisions, statutes, regulations and
administrative promulgations. 



8.9 _No Other Representations or Projections_. Except as set forth in this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, none of Parent or the other
Sellers, the Company, Buyer or Global makes any representation or warranty
whatsoever, and Global and Buyer on the one hand, and the Sellers and the
Company, on the other, is not relying on any such representation or warranty
or any other representation or warranty in its decision to enter into this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. No representation or warranty
is made by any Party as to the future profitability, value, earning power or
prospects of Global, the Companies, the Shares or the Global Stock. Without
limiting the foregoing, each of Global and Buyer on the one hand and the
Sellers on the other, agrees that none of Parent or the other Sellers, the
Companies, Global or Buyer nor any of their respective members, equityholders,
partners and Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees,
representatives and agents make any representation or warranty with respect to
any estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections
and forecasts) provided by any Party in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of Global and Buyer further acknowledges and agrees
after the Closing, it, and its equityholders and Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, employees, equityholders and partners, will
have no further recourse whatsoever against any of the Seller Parties with
respect to the Shares, the subject matter of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement or the Transaction Documents. Each of Seller Parties further
acknowledges and agrees after the Closing, it, and its equityholders and
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees,
equityholders and partners, will have no further recourse whatsoever against
any of Global or Buyer with respect to the Shares, the Stock portion of
Purchase Price, the subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents.

MISCELLANEOUS



10.1 _Modifications_. Any amendment, change or modification of this Agreement

may be amended, changed or modified with the written consent of Global,
Parent and the Majority Members; _provided, however,_ that any change or
waiver which affects a particular Seller or group of Sellers individually in a
manner materially adverse to all Sellers generally (as opposed to all
Sellers), must be approved in writing by such Seller or the majority of such
group of Sellers, as applicable. No failure or delay by any party hereto in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder (and no course of dealing
between or among any of the parties) shall operate as a waiver of any such

constitute a waiver of any subsequent or other default. No single or partial
exercise of any such right, power or privilege shall preclude the further or
full exercise thereof.

\- 63 - 10.3 _Counterparts; Facsimile Transmission_. This Agreement may be executed in
several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which counterparts collectively shall constitute one instrument, and in making
proof of this Agreement, it shall never be necessary to produce or account for
more than one such counterpart. Signatures of a party to this Agreement or

and all of their rights and interests hereunder to one or more of their
affiliates, in each case so long as such Seller or Sellers, as applicable,
remains responsible for the performance of all their respective obligations
hereunder. This Agreement shall be assignable by Buyer to a wholly owned
subsidiary of Global or a wholly-owned subsidiary of any such subsidiary
(unless in each case Buyer or Global intends to sell or transfer such
Subsidiary) without the prior written consent of the Parent, but any such
assignment shall not relieve Buyer or Global of its obligations hereunder. In
addition, the indemnification rights of Buyer or Global under _Article VIII_
hereof may be collaterally assigned to Wachovia Bank, National Association.
Furthermore, as Global intends to merge Buyer with and into the Company
following the Closing, Global shall be entitled to enforce and exercise any of
Buyers rights under any of the Transaction Documents following the
consummation of such merger.



10.6 _Entire and Sole Agreement_. This Agreement and the other schedules and
agreements referred to herein, constitute the entire agreement between the
parties hereto and supersede all prior agreements, representations,

understandings, whether oral or written, express or implied, with respect to
the subject matter hereof other than the Confidentiality Agreement.



10.7 _G OVERNING LAW_. IT IS UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT THE CONSTRUCTION AND

any provision of this Agreement is deemed or held to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable there shall be added hereto automatically a provision as similar
as possible to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision and be legal,
valid and enforceable. Further, should any provision contained in this
Agreement ever be reformed or rewritten by any judicial body of competent
jurisdiction, such provision as so reformed or rewritten shall be binding upon
all parties hereto.



10.9 _Public Announcements_. No party shall make any public announcement of
the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the
other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, _provided,
however,_ that any Party may make any public disclosure it believes in good
faith is required by law or regulation (in which case the disclosing Party
will advise the other Parties prior to making the disclosure and provide a
reasonable opportunity for review and comment prior to making the disclosure).



10.10 _Remedies Cumulative_. The remedies of the parties under this Agreement
are cumulative and shall not exclude any other remedies to which any party
may be lawfully entitled, subject to the terms of _Article VIII_.



10.11 _Waiver_. No failure or delay on the part of any party in exercising any
right, power, or privilege hereunder or under any of the documents delivered

10.12  _W AIVER_ __ _ OF __J URY_ __ ___T RIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY

be entitled to seek injunctive relief or specific performance of the
obligations to be performed by the other Parties in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement.
