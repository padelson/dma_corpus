"Closing Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail Buyer's calculation of
the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Indebtedness, the Final Transaction
Expenses, the Final Benefits Payouts and the Final Closing Cash in accordance
with the Accounting Principles. If Seller does not receive the Closing
Statement within such sixty (60) day period, the Estimated Balance Sheet, the
Estimated Net Working Capital, the Estimated Indebtedness, the Estimated
Transaction Expenses, the Estimated Benefits Payouts and Estimated Closing
Cash contained in Seller's deliveries pursuant to Section 2.3(a) shall, at
Seller's option, be deemed to have been accepted by Buyer and shall become
binding on Buyer and the calculation of the Estimated Net Working Capital, the
Estimated Indebtedness, the Estimated Transaction Expenses, the Estimated
Benefits Payouts and Estimated Closing Cash contained in Seller's deliveries
pursuant to Section 2.3(a) shall be the Final Net Working Capital, the Final
Indebtedness, the Final Transaction Expenses, the Final Benefits Payouts and
Final Closing Cash and Seller's deliveries pursuant to Section 2.3(a) shall be
deemed to be the Final Closing Statement (as defined herein).

(c)Following its receipt from Buyer of the draft Final Balance Sheet and the

Final Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (and Seller shall have the
right, until the final determination of the Final Closing Statement, to (i)
examine all accounting records, work papers and financial records used or
generated in connection with the preparation of the draft Final Balance Sheet,
the Closing Statement and the Final Closing Statement as may be reasonably
requested by Seller and such other documents as Seller may reasonably request
in connection with its review of the draft Final Balance Sheet, the Closing
Statement and the Final Closing Statement and (ii) have access during normal
business hours on advance notice to all Facilities and all employees, agents
and professional advisors of Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries as Seller
may reasonably request in connection with its review of the draft Final
Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the Final Closing Statement) and to
inform Buyer in writing of any disagreement that it may have with the draft
Final Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, which objection shall, to the
extent practicable, specify in reasonable detail Seller's disagreement with
the draft Final Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement and shall in any case
include Seller's calculation of any disputed items, to the extent practicable
(the "Objection"). If Buyer does not receive the Objection within such forty-
five (45) day period, the draft Final Balance Sheet and the amount of the
Final Net Working Capital, the Final Indebtedness, the Final Transaction
Expenses, the Final Benefits Payouts and the Final Closing Cash set forth on
the Closing Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by Seller and
shall become binding upon Seller, and the calculation of the Final Net Working
Capital, the Final Indebtedness, the Final Transaction Expenses, the Final
Benefits Payouts and the Final Closing Cash on the Closing Statement shall be
the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Indebtedness, the Final Transaction
Expenses, the Final Benefits Payouts and the Final Closing Cash, respectively.
If Seller timely delivers an Objection to Buyer, Buyer shall then have ten
(10) days from the date of receipt of such Objection (the "Review Period") to
review and respond to the Objection in writing (and Buyer shall have the right
to examine the work papers and financial records used or generated in
connection with the preparation of the Objection and such other documents as Buyer may reasonably request in connection with
its review of the Objection); provided, however, that Buyer's response to any
Objection shall be limited to those specific disagreements listed in the
Objection. Furthermore, Buyer may not in its response to the Objection change
its calculation of any line item or component of working capital shown in or
the Final Closing Cash shown in Buyer's draft Final Balance Sheet and Closing
Statement that would, taken on an individual basis, have the result of
reducing the Final Net Working Capital or Final Closing Cash, as applicable,
below the amounts thereof indicated in Buyer's draft Final Balance Sheet and
Closing Statement previously delivered to Seller. If Seller does not receive a
written response from Buyer within such ten (10) day period, the draft Final
Balance Sheet and the amount of the Final Net Working Capital, the Final
Indebtedness, the Final Transaction Expenses, the Final Benefits Payouts and
the Final Closing Cash set forth in the Objection shall be deemed to have been
accepted by Buyer and shall become binding upon Buyer, and the calculation of
the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Indebtedness, the Final Transaction
Expenses, the Final Benefits Payouts and Final Closing Cash contained in the
Objection shall be the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Indebtedness, the
Final Transaction Expenses, the Final Benefits Payouts and the Final Closing
Cash, respectively. If Buyer does timely deliver a written response within
such ten (10) day period, Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any disagreements with respect to the Final Balance Sheet and the
determination of the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Indebtedness, the
Final Transaction Expenses, the Final Benefits Payouts and the Final Closing
Cash. If they are unable to resolve all of their disagreements with respect to
the Final Balance Sheet and/or the determination of the Final Net Working
Capital, the Final Indebtedness, the Final Transaction Expenses, the Final
Benefits Payouts and the Final Closing Cash within twenty (20) days following
the expiration of Buyer's Review Period, Buyer and Seller shall promptly refer
the dispute to the CPA Firm, which shall resolve such disagreements based
solely on written presentations by Seller and Buyer, which are in accordance
with the terms and procedures and the definitions of this Agreement, and not
by independent review. The written presentations provided by each of Seller
and Buyer shall be limited such that neither party may change its calculations
of any line item or component of Final Net Working Capital or Final Closing
Cash from the draft Final Balance Sheet and draft Closing Statement, in the
case of Buyer, and the Objection, in the case of Seller, if such change, taken
on an individual basis, would have the result of reducing, in the case of
Buyer, or increasing, in the case of Seller, the calculation of actual Final
Net Working Capital or Final Closing Cash, respectively, set out in the draft
Final Balance Sheet and draft Closing Statement or Objection, as applicable.
Buyer and Seller shall direct the CPA Firm to use its reasonable best efforts
to render its determination within thirty (30) days after the dispute is first
submitted to the CPA Firm. The CPA Firm's determination shall be conclusive
and binding upon Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller shall make readily
available to the CPA Firm all relevant books and records relating to the
Closing Statement or Objection and all other items reasonably requested by the
CPA Firm. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall have or conduct any communication,
either written or oral, with the CPA Firm without the other party either being
present or receiving a concurrent copy of any written communication. Nothing
in this Section 2.3(c) shall be construed to authorize or permit the CPA Firm
to resolve any differences between Buyer and Seller other than those
unresolved disagreements listed in the Objection, and the CPA Firm shall not
be authorized or permitted to do so. The scope of the disputed items to be
resolved by the CPA Firm shall be limited to whether the draft Final Balance
Sheet and the Closing Statement were prepared in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. In resolving any disagreements, the CPA Firm shall be bound by
the provisions of this Section 2.3 and may not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party in its
written presentation or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
party in its written presentation. The Final Balance Sheet, the Final Net
Working Capital, the Final Indebtedness, the Final Transaction Expenses, the
Final Benefits Payouts and the Final Closing Cash as determined by the CPA
Firm shall be the Final Balance Sheet, the Final Net Working Capital, the
Final Indebtedness, the Final Transaction Expenses, the Final Benefits Payouts
and the Final Closing Cash. The Closing Statement as agreed to (or deemed to
be agreed to) by Buyer and Seller or as determined by the CPA Firm, as
applicable, shall be referred to as the "Final Closing Statement."

(d)If any unresolved objections are submitted to the CPA Firm for resolution
as provided above, the fees and expenses of the CPA Firm shall be allocated
between Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, based upon the
relationship the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the
amount actually contested by such party. For example, if Buyer claims that the
appropriate adjustments are $1,000 greater than the amount determined by
Seller, and if the CPA Firm ultimately resolves such claim by awarding to
Buyer $300 of the $1,000 contested, then the fees, costs and expenses of the
CPA Firm will be allocated 70% to Buyer and 30% to Seller.

(e)Upon the final determination of the Final Closing Statement,

(i)if the Purchase Price on the Final Closing Statement is greater than the
estimated Purchase Price paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(v), then an amount in
cash equal to such excess shall be payable by Buyer to Seller in accordance
with Section 2.3(g); and

(ii)if the Purchase Price on the Final Closing Statement is less than the
estimated Purchase Price paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(v), then an amount in
cash equal to such shortfall shall be payable by Seller to Buyer in accordance
with Section 2.3(g).

(f)If the Closing Statement delivered by Buyer shows that the amount, if any,
due to Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.3(e) (such amount, the "Proposed Final
Closing Adjustment") is less than the Adjustment Escrow Funds, then Seller and
Buyer shall, within two (2) Business Days after the delivery of the Closing
Statement by Buyer, jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Seller an
amount in cash equal to the excess of the Adjustment Escrow Funds over the
Proposed Final Closing Adjustment from the Adjustment Escrow Funds.

(g)For purposes of the payment of the items set forth in Section 2.3(e), (i)
if Buyer is required to make a payment to Seller pursuant to Section
2.3(e)(i), then Buyer shall, within two (2) Business Days after the Final
Closing Statement becomes final and binding in accordance with the terms
hereof, make payment to Seller of such amount, in cash, by wire transfer of

where in each such case such Conflict, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to be material to Buyer or have a material adverse
effect on its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.



Section 5.4 No Consents.



The execution and delivery by Buyer of this Agreement does not, and the
performance of its obligations hereunder (including the transactions
contemplated hereby) will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or
permit of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority or
other Person except for the Governmental Requirements.



Section 5.5 Litigation.



There is no Action pending or, to Buyer's Knowledge, proposed or threatened in
writing that involves Buyer, nor any outstanding judgments, orders or decrees

Section 5.7 Investment Representations.

 Buyer acknowledges that the Interests being acquired have not been registered
under the Securities Act or qualified under applicable state securities Laws
in reliance on exemptions therefrom. Buyer is acquiring the Interests for
investment for its own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a
present view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof in
violation of the Securities Act or other applicable securities Laws. Buyer is
familiar with investments of the nature of the Interests, understands that
this investment involves substantial risks, has substantial knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters such that it is capable of
evaluating, and has evaluated, the merits and risks inherent in purchasing the
Interests, and is able to bear such risks. Buyer has made its own independent
examination, investigation, analysis and evaluation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 5.7, nothing
herein shall limit claims and remedies for Actual Fraud.



Section 5.8 Financing.



As of the date of this Agreement, Buyer has received an executed debt
commitment letter ("Commitment Letter") and each fee letter (the "Fee
Letters") dated as of the date hereof (collectively, the "Debt Commitment
Letter") from the Debt Financing Sources identified therein, pursuant to which
the Debt Financing Sources have committed, on the terms and subject to (and
only to) the conditions set forth therein, to provide to Buyer the Debt
Financing in cash in the aggregate principal amount set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter. A true and complete copy of the fully executed Commitment
Letter (including all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto) as in effect on
the date hereof has been provided to the Company. A true and complete copy of
each fully-executed Fee Letter related to the Commitment Letter (including all
exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto) as in effect on the date hereof has
been provided to the Company, except that economic and "market flex" terms
specified therein may have been redacted (none of which redacted provisions
could adversely affect the availability, conditionality, enforceability,
termination or aggregate principal amount of the Debt Financing at the
Closing). Buyer has fully paid any and all commitments or other fees required
by the Debt Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date hereof, and
Buyer will, directly or indirectly, continue to pay in full any such amounts
required to be paid as and when they become due and payable on or prior to the
Closing Date; provided, however, that any payment due and payable on the
Closing Date may be funded contemporaneously with the Closing and subject to
the satisfaction of the other funding conditions in respect of the Debt
Financing on the Closing Date. The Debt Commitment Letter is valid and binding
and in full force and effect, enforceable against Buyer and, to Buyer's
Knowledge, against each other party thereto, except as such enforceability may
be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent conveyance or other Laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally and (b) principles of equity, whether considered at law or in
equity. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies to the
obligations of the parties to make the Debt Financing available on the terms
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, other than as expressly set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter, and Buyer does not have any reason to believe
that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied or that
the Debt Financing will not be available to Buyer on the Closing Date. None of
the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter has been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates has entered
into any agreement, side letter or other arrangement relating to
conditionality with respect to the Debt Financing, other than as set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter. No Debt Financing Source has notified Buyer or any
of its Affiliates of such Debt Financing Source's intention to terminate or
withdraw any of the Debt Financing. Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter, and assuming the
accuracy of the Company's representations and warranties set forth herein and
the compliance by the Company of the covenants set forth herein, Buyer will
have as of the Closing Date, sufficient readily available funds with which to pay the Purchase Price and consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The ability of Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not subject to any condition or
contingency with respect to the Debt Financing or any other financing for or
related to any of the transactions contemplated hereby.



Section 5.9 Absence of Certain Changes or Events.



Since January 1, 2017, there has not occurred any change, effect, or
circumstance that have had a material adverse effect on Buyer's properties,
business, results of operations or condition that would reasonably be likely
to result in the material impairment of, or delay in, Buyer's ability to
effect the Closing or to perform its obligations under this Agreement.



Section 5.10 Solvency; No Fraudulent Conveyance.



Immediately following the Closing, and assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in Article IV of this Agreement and
that the Company and its Subsidiaries satisfy the following statement
immediately prior to the Closing, Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries will
be solvent for all purposes under federal bankruptcy and applicable state
fraudulent transfer and fraudulent conveyance Laws.

efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to cause the other parties'
closing conditions to be satisfied in order to consummate and make effective,
in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including (A) all actions necessary to satisfy the other
parties' closing conditions set forth in Article VII and Article VIII, as
applicable, (B) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers
from third parties (including any Company Required Consents), and (C) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that certain consents, authorizations and approvals to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to Material
Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and such
consents, authorizations and approvals may not be obtained. The failure of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to obtain any such consent (including any
Company Required Consent), authorization or approval shall not delay or
prevent the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, unless required by Article
VII, Buyer agrees that (x) neither Seller, the Company, nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Affiliates or representatives shall
have any liability whatsoever to Buyer or any of its Affiliates arising out of
or relating to the failure to obtain any consents (including any Company
Required Consent), authorizations or approvals that may have been or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
because of the default, acceleration or termination of any such contract,
lease, license or other agreement as a result thereof and (y) no
representation or warranty of Seller or the Company contained herein shall be
breached or deemed breached as a result of the failure to obtain any consent
(including any Company Required Consent), authorization or approval or as a
result of any lawsuit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation commenced or
threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any consent (including any Company Required Consent),
authorization or approval or any such default, acceleration or termination.

(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall not
acquire, or agree to acquire, by merging or consolidating with, or by
purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in or otherwise
making any investment in, or by any other manner (including through any joint
ventures, partnerships or other arrangements), any Person or portion thereof,
or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire or make any investment in any assets,
if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation
of such acquisition, merger, consolidation or investment could reasonably be expected to delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement (other than as specifically provided
in Section 6.3(b) through Section 6.3(e) of this Agreement in connection with
obtaining such authorizations, consents, orders, approvals and waivers from
third parties), neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will be required to
make payments, commence litigation or agree to modifications of the terms and
conditions of any agreements with third parties.

(b)(i) Buyer and Seller shall as promptly as practicable, and in no event
later than 5:00 p.m. U.S. Eastern time on the fifth (5th) day following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, file with the United States Federal
Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the United States Department of Justice (the
"DOJ") the notification and report form, if any, required for the transactions
contemplated hereby and any supplemental information requested in connection
therewith pursuant to the HSR Act. Buyer shall pay the filing fees associated
with all filings under the HSR Act made in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Any such notification and report form and
supplemental information shall be in substantial compliance with the HSR Act.
If requested by Seller, Buyer, Seller and the Company agree to request early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act upon the filing of the
initial notification and report form and upon any subsequent filing of any
notification and report form. Buyer, Seller and the Company shall furnish, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to furnish, to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under the HSR Act. Buyer and Seller shall each (A) upon filing, provide
outside counsel for each other party with a copy of the notification and
report form, as well as any attachments, redacted as necessary to protect
legal privilege or highly confidential business information; (B) keep each of
the filing parties apprised of the status and content of any substantive
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
and documentary material from, any Governmental Authority, whether formal or
informal, including, without limitation, a "second request" (each, an "HSR
Request"); (C) substantially comply as promptly as practicable with any such
HSR Request; (D) provide outside counsel for the other party the reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any proposed written submissions or
presentations to any Governmental Authority; (E) be represented at all in-
person meetings and, to the extent reasonably practicable, in all substantive
conversations with any Governmental Authority regarding the matters set forth
in this Section 6.3, except if, and to the extent that, any Governmental
Authority objects to any party being represented at any such meeting or in any
such conversation; and (F) consult and cooperate with one another in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, conference calls,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings with any
Governmental Authority under or relating to the HSR Act.

(ii) Each of Buyer and Seller (subject to Section 6.3(e) and Section 6.3(f))
shall use its best efforts to obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(iii) It shall be deemed a failure to satisfy the conditions specified in
Section 7.3 or Section 8.3, if in any suit brought by any Person or
Governmental Authority challenging the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of the HSR Act or any other applicable Law, a court
enters or the applicable Governmental Authority makes an order or decree that

employees to incur any personal liability, (C) conflict with the

misconduct or intentional misrepresentation on the part of Seller or the
Company or any of their respective directors, managers, officers, employees,

Section 6.12 Financing.



(a)Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and consummate the Debt Financing at the Closing on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (provided that,
for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer may (i) amend the Debt Commitment Letter
solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date hereof, (2) otherwise replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letter in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 6.12 or (3)
amend the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with any "market flex"
provisions set forth in the Fee Letters (after giving effect to any amendments
or modifications thereto in accordance with the terms and condition set forth
in this Section 6.12)), including using its reasonable best efforts to: (i)
comply with and maintain the Debt Commitment Letter in effect in accordance
with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, (ii) satisfy (or obtain
waivers to) on a timely basis all conditions to funding in the Debt Commitment
Letter and such definitive agreements to be entered into in connection
therewith (other than any condition where the failure to so satisfy is a
result of the Company's failure to furnish information or assistance described in Section 6.11); provided,
however, that nothing in this (a) or elsewhere in this Agreement requires
Buyer to initiate, prosecute or maintain any action, arbitration or other
proceeding against any Debt Financing Source or other Persons providing the
Debt Financing, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment
Letter (subject to the exercise of any "flex" provisions contained therein) or
on terms and conditions no less favorable (taken as a whole) to Buyer, on or
prior to the Closing Date, (iv) comply with and perform the obligations
applicable to it pursuant to such Debt Commitment Letter (other than any
obligation where the failure to so perform or comply is a result of the
Company's failure to furnish information or assistance described in Section
6.11) and (v) draw down on and consummate the Debt Financing if the conditions
to the availability of the Debt Financing have been satisfied or waived. If
any portion of the Debt Financing expires or terminates or otherwise becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment
Letter, Buyer shall promptly notify the Seller in writing and use its
reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, arrange for, enter into definitive agreements with
respect to, and obtain alternative debt financing (the "Alternative
Financing") in an amount sufficient (when taken together with over available
cash on hand or other funds available to Buyer) to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and perform all of its obligations hereunder on terms and
conditions that are not materially less favorable to Buyer, in the aggregate,
than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, it being understood that
if Buyer proceeds with any Alternative Financing, Buyer shall be subject to
the same obligations with respect to such Alternative Financing as set forth
in this Agreement with respect to the Debt Financing.

(b)Buyer shall not replace, amend or modify the Debt Commitment Letter or any
provision thereof (and any Alternative Financing shall be deemed a
replacement, amendment or modification that is subject to the requirements of
this Section 6.12(b)) without Seller's prior written consent if such
replacement, amendment or modification would, or would reasonably be expected
to: (i) delay or prevent the Closing, (ii) make the timely funding of the Debt
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions precedent to obtaining the Debt
Financing) less likely to occur, (iii) adversely impact the ability of Buyer
to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter
or the definitive agreements with respect thereto, (iv) reduce (or would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of
the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount of the Debt Financing unless (x) the Debt Financing is
increased by a corresponding amount, (y) the Debt Financing is otherwise made
available to fund such fees or original issue discount or (z) such reduction
does not cause the aggregate proceeds of the Debt Financing to be insufficient
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the purchase of
the Interests and other payments required to be made by the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates hereunder), or (v) impose new or additional conditions or
otherwise adversely expand, amend or modify any of the existing conditions
precedent to the receipt of the Debt Financing, or otherwise add, expand,
amend or modify any other provision of the Debt Commitment Letter, in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the funding of the Debt
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing)
at the Closing. Upon any permitted amendment, supplement, modification or
replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter (including with respect to any
Alternative Financing) in accordance with this Section 6.12, the term "Debt
Commitment Letter" shall mean the Debt Commitment Letter as so amended,
supplemented, modified or replaced, and references to "Debt Financing" and/or
"Alternative Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as so amended, supplemented, modified or replaced and references to "Debt Financing Sources" shall include the lenders
under any amended, supplemented, modified or replaced Debt Commitment Letter
or Debt Financing.

(c)Buyer shall provide Seller prompt (but in any event, within two (2)
Business Days) notice (i) upon becoming aware of any material breach, default,
repudiation, cancellation or termination (or any event or circumstance that,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to
give rise to any material breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or
termination) by any party of the Debt Commitment Letter or such other
agreements or documents (including any definitive agreements) relating to the
Debt Financing or any termination of the Debt Commitment Letter or such other
agreements or documents (including any definitive agreements) relating to the
Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing), (ii) upon receipt by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates or representatives of any written notice or other written
communication from any party to the Debt Commitment Letter of any material
breach or default under the Debt Commitment Letter or of any repudiation,
cancellation or termination of the Debt Commitment Letter, and (iii) if for
any reason Buyer reasonably expects that it will not be able to obtain, or
there occurs any event or development that could reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely impact the ability of Buyer to obtain, all or any
portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive documents related
to the Debt Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event
within two (2) Business Days after the date Seller delivers Buyer a written
request, Buyer shall provide any information reasonably requested by Seller
relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the
immediately preceding sentence. In addition, Buyer shall keep Seller informed
on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to finalize the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing) and to
satisfy the conditions thereof and provide to Seller copies of all executed
material definitive documents related to the Debt Financing (or Alternative
Financing).

Meadow Valley Contractors, Inc. will remit to Seller or one of its Affiliates

the consent of any third party to any Contract currently in effect to which
any Transferred Asset is subject, in each case, excluding such costs or
payments reimbursed by Buyer in connection with this Section 6.15, (b) provide
additional representations and warranties with respect to any Transferred

Seller's direct and indirect owners from the Closing of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, taking into

with the transfer of any Transferred Asset or distribution of proceeds
received therefrom). In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer (i) shall
promptly, upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller or its applicable Affiliate

consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other agents from

of doubt, effecting the transfer of any Transferred Asset will not be a
condition precedent under Article VII of this Agreement to the obligations of
Buyer to consummate the closing of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement.



Section 6.16 Unison Mortgage.



Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the amendment,
restatement or release of the Unison Mortgage (the "Unison Mortgage

Section 9.2 Sole Remedy.



Following the Closing, the sole recourse for any and all losses, liabilities,
claims, damages, awards, penalties, Taxes, fines, demands, obligations, costs
and expenses or other relief (including interest, penalties and attorneys'

the foregoing) of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Losses")
incurred or suffered by Buyer, the Company and each of their respective
equityholders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
representatives, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
beneficiaries, heirs, successors or assignees (or any former, current or
future equityholder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, agent,

beneficiary, heir, successor or assign of any of the foregoing) (collectively,
the "Buyer Parties") for all claims under this Agreement or arising from,
related to or suffered as a result of the transactions contemplated by this

of any of their representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
under this Agreement or (ii) arising from or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) Buyer, on its own behalf and

extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and
causes of action (including rights of contribution, if any) known or unknown,
foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may
have against each Seller Party for the breach of any representation, warranty,
pre-Closing covenant or other agreement under this Agreement or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (c) the
Seller Parties shall have no other claims or causes of action against the
Buyer Parties and (d) Seller, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Seller
Parties, hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by

the future, that it may have against each Buyer Party for the breach of any
representation, warranty, pre-Closing covenant or other agreement under this
Agreement or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The receipt of the foregoing releases is an essential
inducement to the parties hereto entering into this Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated herein. Each of the parties hereto covenants and
agrees that it will not, at any time hereafter, directly or indirectly,
commence or initiate (or cause another to commence or initiate), or
participate in, any proceeding against or involving any Buyer Party or Seller
Party, as applicable, that relates solely to the matters covered by the
releases set forth above, unless and until requested to do so by such Buyer
Party or Seller Party, as applicable (and then at Seller's or Buyer's (as
applicable) sole option), or compelled to do so under penalty of law pursuant
to the lawfully issued process of a legal, judicial, legislative or regulatory
authority. Each of Buyer and Seller acknowledges and agrees that, following

Buyer, in the case of Seller, contained herein or for any other right, claim
or course of action arising in connection with or with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each of Buyer and Seller
hereby waives, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Parties and Seller
Parties, respectively, any right to rescind this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing herein shall operate to limit or
eliminate the common law liability of any Seller Party to Buyer for actual
fraud in the event such Seller Party is finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have committed Actual Fraud.



ARTICLE 10

TAX MATTERS



Section 10.1 Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods.



Seller, at its own cost and expense, shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
file all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries which are due to be
filed on or before the Closing Date. Seller shall also prepare or cause to be
prepared any amendments to such Tax Returns if such amendments are filed on or
before the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be provided to Buyer at least
five (5) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return, including any
extensions, and Buyer shall have the right to comment on such Tax Return,
which comments Seller shall consider in good faith. Seller shall cause all
Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries shown due on such Tax Returns to be
paid. Any deductions or other Tax benefits arising by reason of the payment of
the Transaction Expenses and Benefits Payouts shall be taken into account in a
taxable period (or portion thereof) after the Closing Date unless otherwise
required by applicable Law; provided, that notwithstanding the fact that any
such deduction or other Tax benefit is taken into account in a Pre-Closing Tax
Period pursuant to applicable Law, such deduction or other Tax benefit shall
not be taken into account in computing the Pre-Closing Income Tax Amount
included as Indebtedness for purposes of Section 2.3.



Section 10.2 Allocation of the Purchase Price.



The Purchase Price (and all other amounts treated as consideration for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) shall be allocated among (i) the assets of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries that are treated as entities disregarded
as separate from the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (ii) the
stock or other equity interests held by the Company with respect to any of its
Subsidiaries not described in clause (i) above, in each case, in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder to the extent applicable (and any
similar provision of state or local Law, as appropriate) and the methodologies
described in Schedule 10.2. Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a
statement setting forth an allocation of the Purchase Price (and all other
amounts treated as consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes) in a
manner consistent with the methodologies described in Schedule 10.2 (the
"Proposed Allocation Statement"). Within twenty (20) days following receipt of
the Proposed Allocation Statement, Seller shall provide any written comments
to such Proposed Allocation Statement, which Buyer shall consider in good
faith. If the Parties cannot agree or otherwise resolve any disputed items in
connection with such Proposed Allocation Statement, such disputed items shall
be referred to Duff and Phelps (the "Third Party Valuation Firm") for resolution
within twenty (20) days following such referral in the form of a written
determination by the Third Party Valuation Firm in accordance with the
methodologies described in Schedule 10.2 (any expenses arising in connection
with any referral to the Third Party Valuation Firm shall be borne 50% by
Buyer and 50% by Seller). The Proposed Allocation Statement, as agreed upon by
Buyer and Seller or otherwise determined by the Third Party Valuation Firm
(the "Final Allocation Statement"), shall be binding, and each Party shall
report, act and file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such Final
Allocation Statement and shall not take any position contrary thereto in
respect of Taxes; provided, however that nothing herein shall be construed so
as to prevent either Party from settling, or require such Party to commence or
participate in, any litigation or other judicial or administrative proceeding
challenging any determination made or other action taken by any Governmental
Authority with respect to Tax matters attributable to such allocation set
forth in the Final Allocation Statement. If any adjustment is made to the
Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement, a corresponding adjustment shall be
made to the Final Allocation Statement in a manner consistent with the
methodologies described in Schedule 10.2, as appropriate. The provisions of
this Section 10.2 will survive the Closing indefinitely.



Section 10.3 Cooperation on Tax Matters.



(a)Buyer, Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall cooperate fully, as
and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Article X and any audit, litigation
or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Each of Buyer and Seller shall (i) retain any books and records in
its possession with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by any party, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable
periods, and abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
taxing authority and (ii) give one another reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
other so requests, allow the other to take possession of such books and
records.

(b)Buyer and Seller further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).



Section 10.4 Tax Contests.

 To the extent an audit, investigation or claim with respect to Taxes by any
Governmental Authority may have a material impact on the amount of Taxes
included in the Final Closing Statement described in Section 2.3(c), Buyer
shall (a) promptly provide Seller with written notice of any such audit,
investigation or claim with respect to Taxes, (b) allow Seller to manage,
control and defend (at its sole expense) such audit or inquiry; provided,
however, that, if any such audit or inquiry could have an adverse and material
effect on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Seller may not settle such
matter without the consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, and (c) provide, and cause the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries to provide, such assistance and access to information to Seller
as is reasonably necessary in connection therewith. Seller shall promptly
provide Buyer with written notice of any audit, investigation or claim with
respect to Taxes by any Governmental Authority related to the Company or its
Subsidiaries; provided, however, for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall have
no obligation pursuant to this Section 10.4 in respect of any such audit,
investigation or claim raised after the final determination of the Final
Closing Statement pursuant to Section 2.3.



Section 10.5 Transfer Taxes and Fees.



All sales, transfer (including, without limitation, real estate transfer Tax),
recording, deed, stamp, registration, documentary, conveyancing, franchise,
property, notarial, grantor or grantee Taxes in connection with the
effectuation of the transfer of the Interests, whether imposed on Buyer,
Seller, the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries, shall be paid by
Buyer. Buyer and Seller further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to the
purchase and sale of the Interests under this Agreement).



Section 10.6 Tax-Sharing Agreements.



All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or involving
the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or any Affiliate of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, if any, shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after
the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be bound thereby
or have any liability thereunder.



Section 10.7 Post-Closing Actions.



Without Seller's prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed), Buyer will not, and shall not permit any
of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to take any of the following actions
with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries to the
extent such action may have a material impact on the amount Taxes included in
the Final Closing Statement described in Section 2.3(c), in each case for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period: (a) amend, re-file, or supplement any previously filed
Tax Return of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (b) change any material Tax
election with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries, (c) extend or waive
any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, (d) initiate discussions or examinations with a
Governmental Authority with respect to Taxes or make any voluntary disclosures
with respect to Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (e) voluntarily
approach any Governmental Authority regarding any Taxes or Tax Returns of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (f) take any action relating to Taxes
or that could create a Tax liability on the Closing Date that is outside the
ordinary course of business; provided, however, for the avoidance of doubt,
Buyer shall have no obligation pursuant to this Section 10.7 in respect of any such action after
the final determination of the Final Closing Statement pursuant to Section
2.3.





Section 10.8 Withholding.



Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from
the applicable portion of the Purchase Price and any other amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement and any subsequent adjustments thereto,
such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such
payments under the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
other applicable Law; provided, however, that Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly notify Seller of any intended withholding
(other than withholding in respect of compensatory payments or Seller's
failure to comply with Section 7.4(j)) and the amount of such withholding and
cooperate with Seller to reduce or eliminate any such withholding. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and are timely paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.



ARTICLE XI

TERMINATION



Section 11.1 Termination.



This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned only as follows:

(a)by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

(b)by Seller or Buyer upon written notice to the other, if the Closing Date
shall not have occurred on or before October 10, 2018 (the "End Date");
provided, however, that in the event Seller is seeking to specifically enforce
Buyer's obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and/or to prevent or cure breaches of this Agreement by Buyer, then
the End Date (as extended, as applicable) shall be extended to the date that
is ten (10) Business Days subsequent to the date that any such proceedings
related to Seller's efforts are finally judicially determined and are no
longer subject to appeal. In the event that the Closing Date shall not have
occurred on or before the End Date (as extended, as applicable), then either
Seller or Buyer may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other;
provided, further, that a party may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this (b) if the terminating party is in breach of this Agreement so as to
cause the conditions to the non-terminating party's obligations to close to
not be satisfied;

(c)by Buyer upon written notice to Seller, if a breach of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company or Seller
contained in this Agreement shall have occurred that (i) would result in the
failure of a condition set forth in Article VII and (ii) is not curable or, if
curable, is not cured upon the occurrence of the earlier of (x) thirty (30)
days after written notice thereof is given by Buyer to Seller and (y) the day
that is two (2) Business Days prior to the End Date; provided, however, that
Buyer may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1(c), if
Buyer is in breach of this Agreement so as to cause the conditions to Seller's
obligations to close to not be satisfied;

(d)by Seller upon written notice to Buyer, if a breach of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Buyer contained in
this Agreement shall have occurred that (i) would result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VIII

Agreement so as to cause the conditions to Buyer's obligations to close to not
be satisfied;

(e)by Seller, upon written notice to Buyer, (i) if all of the conditions set
forth in Article VII have been satisfied or waived as of the date the Closing
should have been consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied simultaneously
with the Closing and could have been satisfied or would have been waived
assuming a Closing would occur), (ii) Buyer fails to complete the Closing
within five (5) Business Days after the later of (A) delivery of the
confirmation by Seller required by clause (iii) below and (B) the date by
which the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.1 (the "First
Date"); and (iii) Seller and the Company have provided irrevocable written
notice to Buyer as required pursuant to Section 6.9 at least one (1) Business
Day prior to the First Date confirming that (A) all of the conditions to
Seller's and the Company's obligations to consummate the Closing have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing and could have been satisfied or would have been
waived assuming a Closing would occur) and (B) if Buyer performs its
obligations hereunder and the Debt Financing is funded then Seller and the
Company stand ready, willing and able to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; or

(f)by Seller or Buyer, after receipt of a "second request" from either the FTC
or the DOJ.



Section 11.2 Rights on Termination.



(a)If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1, all further
obligations of the parties under or pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate
without further liability of any party to the other; provided, however, that,
that this Section 11.2 and the provisions of Section 6.7, Section 6.15 Section
12.2, Section 12.6, Section 12.9, Section 12.10, Section 12.11, Section 12.12,
Section 12.14, Section 12.15, Section 12.16, Section 12.17, Section 12.18,
Section 12.19, Section 12.20, Section 12.21, Section 12.22, Section 12.23 and
Section 12.24 of this Agreement shall survive the termination of this
Agreement; provided, further, that nothing contained in this Section 11.2
shall relieve any party from liability for any intentional breach of a
material provision of this Agreement.

(b)If this Agreement is validly terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section
11.1(b) at a time when Seller is entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 11.1(d) or Section 11.1(e)), or by Seller pursuant to Section
11.1(d) or Section 11.1(e), then Buyer shall promptly (and in any event within
three (3) Business Days following such termination) pay to Seller, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller, an
amount equal to $7,250,000 (the "Termination Fee").

(c)The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 11.2
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if Buyer fails to promptly pay any amounts due
pursuant to Section 11.2(b) and, in order to obtain such payment, Seller or
the Company commences a suit or brings an action, Buyer shall pay to Seller
and the Company, (i) their reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit or action and (ii) interest on
the amount payable pursuant to any judgment rendered in or settlement entered
into with respect to such suit or action, at the prime rate as published in
the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was originally required to be made pursuant to Section 11.2(b) plus
three percent (3%), with such interest being payable in respect of the period
from the date that payment was originally required to be made pursuant to
Section 11.2(b) through the date of payment.

(d)Subject to the last sentence of this Section 11.2(c), in the event that
Seller shall be entitled to the Termination Fee, the payment by Buyer to
Seller of the Termination Fee shall constitute liquidated damages for the
termination of this Agreement in the circumstances set forth therein, as the
actual damages of Seller would be difficult or impossible to prove, and shall
constitute (along with the amounts to which Seller or its applicable
Affiliates are entitled under Section 6.11(c) and the final sentence of
Section 6.2) the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller, the Company, each of
their respective direct or indirect equityholders, Affiliates and
representatives, and any other Person against Buyer and, without limiting
Section 12.24, the Debt Financing Sources, and any of their respective former,
current, or future general or limited partners, equityholders, managers,
members, management companies, directors, officers, Affiliates, employees,
representatives or agents and any and all former, current or future heirs,
executors, administrators, trustees, successors or assigns of any of the
foregoing, any Debt Financing Sources, and each Affiliate, officer, director,
employee, controlling person, advisor, agent, attorney or representatives of
any such Person (each, a "Buyer Related Party"), and no Buyer Related Party
shall have any other liability or obligation for any or all Losses suffered or
incurred by Seller, the Company, any of either of their direct or indirect
equityholders or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereunder or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, and neither Seller, the Company, any
of their direct or indirect equityholders Affiliates and representatives, nor
any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other Action
against Buyer or any other Buyer Related Party arising out of this Agreement,
or any of the transactions contemplated hereunder or any matters forming the
basis for such termination. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees
that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 11.2(c) are an integral part
of the this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder and (ii) in
light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with respect
to the foregoing, the right to receive the Termination Fee constitutes a
reasonable estimate of the losses or damages, that will be suffered by reason
of any such termination of this Agreement and constitutes liquidated damages
(and not a penalty). Without limiting the foregoing, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that in the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section 11.1(b) (at a time when Seller is
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(d) or Section
11.1(e)), or by Seller pursuant to Section 11.1(d) or Section 11.1(e), then
the maximum aggregate liability of Buyer and, subject to Section 12.24 any
other Buyer Related Party under this Agreement or relating to the transactions
contemplated hereunder shall be limited to an amount equal to the Termination
Fee (along with the amounts to which Seller or its applicable Affiliates are
entitled under Section 6.11(c) and the final sentence of Section 6.2), and in
no event shall Seller, the Company, any of either of their direct or indirect
equityholders, Affiliates or representatives or any other Person seek to
recover any money damages in excess of such amounts. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that in no event shall Buyer be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion or to any Person other than Seller.
Under no circumstances shall Seller be permitted or entitled to receive both
(x) a grant of specific performance under Section 12.21 and (y) payment of the
Termination Fee. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
11.2(c), the provisions of Section 6.7 shall not be affected by any payments
made pursuant to this Section 11.2(c), and Section 6.7 shall survive in
accordance with its terms. (e)Other than as set forth in the final sentence of Section 6.2, Section 6.7,
Section 6.11(c), Section 6.14, Section 6.15, this Section 11.2, Section 12.2
and Section 12.21, the maximum liability of Buyer for monetary damages based
on any breach of this Agreement or for any claim based on tort, breach of
contract or otherwise that relates to or arises out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be $7,250,000.



ARTICLE XII

MISCELLANEOUS



Section 12.1 Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties.



Buyer acknowledges that (a) it has had, and pursuant to this Agreement shall
have before Closing, access to the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective assets and the officers or other representatives of the Company,
its Subsidiaries and Seller and (b) in making the decision to enter into this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer has
relied solely on (i) its own independent investigation, including
environmental and other inspections, and (ii) the express representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements specifically set forth in this Agreement
and any other agreement or certificate delivered pursuant hereto, and Seller
and the Company expressly disclaim all liability and responsibility for, and
Buyer expressly acknowledges and agrees that it has not relied upon, any
representation, warranty, statement or communication made, communicated
(orally or in writing) to Buyer or any of its Affiliates, employees, agents,
consultants or representatives other than as expressly set forth in this

(including, without limitation, any opinion, information, projection or advice
that may have been provided to Buyer by any officer, director, manager,
employee, agent, consultant, representative or advisor of the Company, its
Subsidiaries, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates). Toward this end,
except to the extent expressly incorporated in the representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement or any other agreement or certificate
delivered pursuant hereto, neither the Company nor Seller or Seller's
Affiliates shall have liability to Buyer, any Buyer Party (including following
the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) or any other Person resulting
from the distribution to Buyer, or Buyer's use of, any such information
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries, or prepared by or on behalf of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, and supplied to Buyer before or after the
date of this Agreement, or any information, documents or materials made
available to Buyer in any data rooms, any presentations or any other form
relating to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection

Company with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and,
except as expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement, neither the
Company nor Seller nor either of their respective Affiliates has made, and THE
COMPANY, SELLER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES MAKE NO AND DISCLAIM ANY, AND
BUYER DISCLAIMS ANY RELIANCE ON ANY, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND WHETHER BY COMMON LAW, STATUTE, OR OTHERWISE,
REGARDING (i) TITLE TO ANY ASSETS OR LAND USE RIGHTS, (ii) THE QUALITY,
CONDITION, OR OPERABILITY OF ANY REAL OR PERSONAL PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT OR
FIXTURES, INCLUDING FREEDOM FROM LATENT OR PATENT VICES OR DEFECTS, THEIR
MERCHANTABILITY, THEIR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THEIR CONFORMITY

CONSTITUTE AN ADMISSION OR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, OF FAULT,
RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY OF ANY KIND BY THE COMPANY, ANY OF ITS
SUBSIDIARIES, OR SELLER UNDER ANY LAW. Buyer agrees that, to the extent
required by Law to be effective, the disclosures contained in this Section
12.1 are "conspicuous" for purposes of any such Laws. Seller's Affiliates and
their respective members, partners, stockholders, managers, directors,
officers, agents and employees are third party beneficiaries of this Section
12.1. Nothing in this Section 12.1 shall in any way limit Buyer's rights as to
claims for Actual Fraud. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, if in connection with any Action alleging Actual Fraud of a Seller
Party (other than in connection with the representations and warranties made
by Seller and the Company in Articles III and IV) the prevailing party in such
Action shall be entitled to receive, in addition to all other remedies to
which such prevailing party may be entitled, the costs and expenses incurred
by the applicable prevailing party in such Action, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses, court costs, and other expenses, even if not
recoverable by Law (including, without limitation, all fees, taxes, costs, and
expenses incident to appellate, bankruptcy, and post-judgment proceedings).



Section 12.2 Confidentiality.



Each the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Confidentiality
Agreement remains in full force and effect; provided, that the parties hereto
agree that the Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate and be
of no further force or effect at the Closing; provided, further, that nothing in this Section 12.2 shall prohibit Buyer from making any public
announcement or SEC Filing permitted by Section 12.6. In the event that this
Agreement is terminated, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms.



Section 12.3 Indemnification of Managers, Directors and Officers.



All rights to indemnification provided in the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
organizational and governing documents (as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement) shall survive the Closing in accordance with their respective
terms. On or prior to the Closing, the Company will purchase, for the benefit
of each Person who is now, has been at any time prior to the Closing Date, or
who becomes prior to the Closing Date a director, manager, officer,
shareholder, member or partner of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Indemnified Persons") a prepaid "tail" directors and
officers insurance policy (the "Tail Policy"), that (a) provides directors'
and officers' liability insurance to the Indemnified Persons on substantially
the same terms and conditions as the directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy currently in place for the benefit of such Indemnified
Persons, including coverage with respect to any fees, costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, suits, proceedings or investigations, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such
Indemnified Person's service as a director, manager, officer, shareholder,
member or partner of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or services
performed by such Indemnified Person at the request of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, in each case occurring on or prior to the Closing Date,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing Date, (b) has a
one-time premium not to exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the Company's
current annual premium, and (c) covers a period of time ending no earlier than
the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date. The cost of the Tail Policy shall
be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller (such portion being taken into account
as part of Transaction Expenses). The provisions of this Section 12.3 shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
indemnitee to whom this provision applies without the consent of such affected
indemnitee and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each indemnified party, its heirs and its legal representatives.



Section 12.4 WARN Act.



Subject to the Seller delivering to Buyer no later than three (3) Business
Days prior to Closing Date a list, by name, job title, date and work location,
of each employee of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries whose employment
was terminated by the Company and any of its Subsidiaries within the ninety
(90) day period immediately preceding the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to, following the Closing Date, indemnify and
hold harmless Seller from and against any and all damages arising out of or
otherwise in respect of any suit or claim of violation brought against Seller
or any of its Affiliates by any employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the "Company Employees") under the U.S. Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act or any other displaced worker notification Law for
any actions or inactions taken within the ninety (90) days immediately
following the Closing Date by Buyer or the Company or its Subsidiaries (or
their respective Affiliates) with respect to any facility, site of employment
or operating unit of the Company Employees.



Section 12.5 Employee Matters.



(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time (or if earlier, until the termination of
employment of the relevant employee), Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall
cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to use their commercially
reasonable efforts, to provide the non-unionized employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who remain employees of the Company
or its Subsidiaries through such period (the "Current Employees") with (i)
base salary and annual cash incentive compensation opportunities, which are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the aggregate base salary and
annual incentive compensation opportunities provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the date hereof, and (ii) retirement (401(k)
plan) and welfare benefits and perquisites (excluding equity and equity based,
defined benefit pension, nonqualified or deferred compensation, and retiree
welfare benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
(excluding defined benefit pension, nonqualified or deferred compensation,
equity or equity-based, and retiree welfare benefits) provided by the Company
and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the date hereof.

(b) In the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, with respect to any
employee benefit plan in which any Current Employee first becomes eligible to
participate, on or after the Effective Time (the "New Company Plans"), Buyer
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable
efforts to: (i) (A) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
such Current Employee under the New Company Plans providing health benefits,
but only to the extent that such conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
were satisfied or did not apply under the analogous Employee Benefit Plan in
effect immediately prior to Closing, and (B) provide credit to such Current
Employee for all deductibles, co-payments and the like incurred by such
Current Employee for the plan year in which the Closing occurs, under any New
Company Plans providing health benefits in which such Current Employee may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time in such plan year, but only
to the extent such deductible, co-payments and the like were satisfied or did
not apply under the analogous Employee Benefit Plan in effect immediately
prior to Closing, and (ii) recognize service of Current Employees (or
otherwise credited by the Company or its Subsidiaries) accrued prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of eligibility and vesting under any New Company
Plan providing 401(k) or paid time off benefits in which such Current
Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time for the same
purposes that such credit was recognized under the analogous Employee Benefit
Plan; provided, however, that in no event shall any credit be given to the
extent it would result in the duplication of benefits or compensation for the
same period of service.

(c) No provision of this Section 12.5 shall be deemed to constitute an
establishment, amendment or termination of any Employee Benefit Plan, New
Company Plan, or any other benefit or compensation plan, policy, Contract,
agreement, arrangement or program of Buyer, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, nor shall this Section 12.5 limit, in any way, the
ability of Buyer, the Company or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to following
the Closing establish, amend or terminate any Employee Benefits Plans, New
Company Plan, or any other benefit or compensation plan, policy, Contract,
agreement, arrangement and programs at any time in their sole discretion.
Nothing in this Section 12.5 shall provide any individual any right to
continued employment or service, or any particular term or condition of
employment or service with Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, or grant any Person, other than the parties to this Agreement, any
rights or remedies whatsoever, including any third party beneficiary rights or
inure to the benefit of or be enforceable by any Current Employee or any
entity or Person representing the interests of any Current Employee. Nothing
in this Section 12.5, express or implied, shall limit the ability of Buyer,
the Company or their Subsidiaries to following the Closing terminate the employment or
service of any Person (including a Current Employee) at any time and for any
or no reason.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
compensation, benefits, and other employment terms and conditions of Current
Employees represented by a labor union or other labor organization shall be
exclusively governed by applicable Law and the terms of any Contract with any
such labor union or other labor organization.



Section 12.6 Public Announcements.



The timing and content of all public announcements or press releases made
hereafter regarding any aspect of this Agreement shall be mutually agreed upon
in advance by Seller and Buyer in their respective sole discretion; provided,
however, that nothing herein shall prevent any party from issuing or causing
publication of any such press release or public announcement to the extent
that such disclosure is upon advice of outside counsel required by Law, in
which case the party making such determination will use reasonable efforts to
allow the other parties hereto reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of its issuance or publication. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that (i) each of Buyer and Seller and
their respective Affiliates may provide general information about the subject
matter of this Agreement in connection with such Person's normal fund raising,
marketing, informational or reporting activities to existing or potential
limited partners of such Person (so long as such recipients agree to, or are
bound by contract or professional or fiduciary obligations to, keep the terms
of this Agreement confidential and so long as the parties shall be responsible
to the other parties hereto for breach of this Section 12.6 or such
confidentiality obligations by the recipients of its disclosure); and (ii)
Buyer shall file a Form 8-K as promptly as practicable after the date hereof
containing this Agreement and may otherwise disclose in its investor
presentations and press releases the purchase price, summary financial
information and a description of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, prior to Closing, Buyer may not file
or otherwise make publicly available pursuant to a Form 8-K or otherwise, the
Financial Statements.



Section 12.7 "Insight Equity" Name.



Buyer agrees that from and after the Closing, neither it nor any of its
Affiliates shall use the name "Insight Equity" or any confusingly similar
name.



Section 12.8 Counsel.



It is acknowledged by each of the parties hereto that Seller, the Company, and
their Affiliates have retained Hunton, Spencer Fane LLP and in-house counsel
with Insight Equity Management Company LLC (together with Hunton and Spencer
Fane LLP, the "Existing Counsel") to act as their counsel in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and that the Existing Counsel has not
acted as counsel for any other Person in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and that no other party to this Agreement or Person has
the status of a client of the Existing Counsel for conflict of interest or any
other purposes as a result thereof. Buyer hereby acknowledges and the Company
affirms its pre-existing agreement that, in the event that a dispute arises
between Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) and Seller or any of its Affiliates
(hereafter "Disputes"), the Existing Counsel may represent Seller or any of
its Affiliates in such Disputes even though the interests of Seller or its
Affiliates may be directly adverse to Buyer, the Company or any of their
Affiliates, and even though the Existing Counsel may have acquired
confidential information from or about the Company or any of its Affiliates
related to any Disputes, represented the Company, its Subsidiaries, or one or more of their Affiliates
in a matter substantially related to such Disputes, or may be handling ongoing
matters for Seller, the Company or one or more of their Affiliates. Buyer and
the Company hereby consent to and waive, on behalf of themselves and each of
their Affiliates, any conflict of interest in connection with representation
by Existing Counsel in connection with any Disputes. Moreover, Buyer and the
Company (each for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates) agree and covenant
not to seek to disqualify the Existing Counsel from Disputes. This is in
addition to any consent or waiver provided prior to Closing to the Existing
Counsel by the Company or its Affiliates. Buyer further agrees and the Company
(for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates) affirms its pre-existing
agreement that Seller owns all legal files and all rights to assert or waive
privilege associated with the Existing Counsel's representation of the Company
and its Affiliates prior to the Closing, whether those files are with in-house
Existing Counsel or outside Existing Counsel, in each case to the extent that
such representations relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any other representation conducted by the Existing Counsel
jointly with Seller or its Affiliates. Ownership of such files and the right
to assert or waive privilege shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer, the
Company, or any of their respective Affiliates. Buyer agrees that it will not,
and that it will cause its Affiliates not to, (i) access or use the
communications and materials exchanged among the Company, Existing Counsel,
Seller and Seller's Affiliates that relate in any way to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other representation conducted by the
Existing Counsel jointly with Seller or its Affiliates, including by way of
review of any electronic data, communications or other information or by
seeking to have the Seller waive the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other privilege, or by otherwise asserting that any of the Buyer
or any of Buyer's Affiliates has the right to assert or waive the attorney-
client privilege, the work product doctrine or other privilege or (ii) seek to
obtain such communications or materials from Existing Counsel. Buyer and the
Company agree to take, and to cause their Affiliates to take, all steps
necessary to implement the intent of this Section 12.8 and not to take or
cause their Affiliates to take positions contrary to the intent of this
Section 12.8.

pertaining to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior
and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions
of the parties, whether oral or written, pertaining to the subject matter
hereof and thereof. No amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or
termination of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by
the party to be bound thereby. No waiver of any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be deemed, or shall constitute, a waiver of any other
provision of this Agreement, whether or not similar, nor shall such waiver
constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided in writing.

Section 12.11, Section 12.12, Section 12.19, Section 12.21, Section 12.24 and
this Section 12.9 (and any defined termed used therein or any provision of
this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification, waiver or termination
of such defined term or provision would modify the substance of Section 11.2,
Section 12.6, Section 12.11, Section 12.12, Section 12.14, Section 12.19,
Section 12.21, Section 12.24 and this Section 12.9) may not be amended,

respect to the Debt Financing Sources without prior written consent of each
such Debt Financing Source.

transactions contemplated hereby.



Section 12.14 Assignment.



This Agreement and each party's respective rights and obligations hereunder

hereunder to the Debt Financing Sources and any lender providing financing

and its rights hereunder as collateral in respect of such financing) to Buyer
in connection with the Closing and (y) assign its rights under this Agreement
in connection with any sale or transfer of equity securities of, or any
merger, consolidation, change of control or other business combination
involving, Buyer, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, and (b) Buyer may,

indirect Affiliate of Buyer, but no such assignment of this Agreement or any
of the rights or obligations hereunder pursuant to clause (a) or (b) above
shall relieve Buyer of any of its obligations under this Agreement; provided,
further that, if either party terminates this Agreement pursuant to Article
XI, Seller may, at its election, assign its rights under this Agreement to the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries. This Agreement shall be binding upon and

Except as provided in Section 9.2, Section 12.1, Section 12.3, Section 12.8

the exercise by a party hereto of any one remedy will not waive its right to
seek or preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Nothing contained in this

limit any party's right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance
under this Section 12.21 before exercising any termination right under Section

of any proceeding pursuant to this Section 12.21 or anything contained in this
Section 12.21 restrict or limit any party's right to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with the terms of Section 11.1 or pursue any other remedies
under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter (but in no
instance with a party be entitled to both specific performance and damages or
a Termination Fee under Article XI).

(b)Subject to Section 11.2 and Section 12.21(e), the parties hereto agree that
(i) irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached (including the failure of a party hereto to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), (ii) money damages or other legal remedies
would not be an adequate remedy for any such damage, (iii) the provisions in
Section 11.2 shall not diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any party's
right to specific performance as set forth in this Section 12.21 and (iv) the
right of specific performance as set forth in this Section 12.21 is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and without that right,
none of the parties hereto would have entered into this Agreement. Subject to
Section 11.2 and Section 12.21(e), it is accordingly agreed that the parties
hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (including the failure of a party hereto to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), in each case without posting a bond or undertaking, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity
until such time as Buyer pays the Termination Fee in accordance with Section
11.2. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting
of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief sought in
accordance with this Section 12.21 on the basis that (A) the party seeking
such remedy has an adequate remedy at law or (B) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

(c)Until such time as Buyer pays the Termination Fee in accordance with
Section 11.2, Seller and the Company shall be permitted and entitled to seek
both a grant of specific performance and payment of the Termination Fee;
provided, however, that under no circumstance shall Seller and the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive both (i) a grant of specific performance to
cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated and (ii) payment
of the Termination Fee.

(d)To the extent any party hereto brings any proceeding to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement or
any other agreement or instrument executed in connection herewith in
accordance with this Section 12.21, the End Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which
such proceeding is pending, plus ten (10) Business Days, or (ii) such other
time period established by the court presiding over such proceeding.

(e)Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, including
Section 12.21(a)-(d), the parties hereto agree that Seller and the Company
shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the obligation of Buyer to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder only if each of the
following conditions are met: (i) all of the conditions set forth in Article
VII have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
at the Closing and can be satisfied if the Closing were to occur); (ii) the
Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing; (iii) Seller
and the Company have irrevocably confirmed in writing to Buyer that each of
them stand ready and willing to consummate the Closing and will take actions
required of them to consummate the Closing upon the funding of the Debt
Financing; and (iv) Buyer fails to complete the Closing pursuant to and in
accordance with Section 2.1. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall
Seller or the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically
Buyer's obligation to consummate the Closing if the Debt Financing has not
been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing), and in no event shall any
Person other than Seller or the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to
enforce or seek to enforce specifically Buyer's obligation to consummate the
Closing.

Investment Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Seller" and
together with Buyer, the "Parties," and each individually a "Party"), and
Citibank, N.A., as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"). Capitalized terms used
but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the
Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of August 9, 2018 (the "Purchase
Agreement"), by and among Buyer, Seller and Consolidated Construction
Solutions I LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Company").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, as of the Effective Date, Seller owns 100% of the issued and
outstanding limited liability company membership interests in the Company (the
"Interests");

acquisition by Buyer of the Interests;

WHEREAS, the Purchase Agreement further provides for the delivery by Buyer to
the Escrow Agent, at the Closing, of $6,000,000 (the "Adjustment Escrow
Amount"), to be held in a separate bank account designated in writing by the
Escrow Agent (the "Adjustment Escrow Account"). The Adjustment Escrow Amount,
as such amount is decreased or increased, including by the accumulation of
Earnings (as defined below), pursuant to this Escrow Agreement, is referred to
herein as the "Escrow Fund;" and

WHEREAS, the Parties agree to place in escrow the Adjustment Escrow Amount,
and the Escrow Agent agrees to hold, invest and distribute the Escrow Fund, in
accordance with the terms of this Escrow Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and agreements of the Parties
and the Escrow Agent and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties and the
Escrow Agent agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

ESCROW



Section 1.1Acceptance of Appointment as Escrow Agent. The Parties hereby
appointEscrow Agent to act as escrow agent hereunder, and the Escrow Agent, by
signing this Escrow Agreement, accepts such appointment and agrees to hold,
invest and distribute the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms of
this Escrow Agreement.

Section 1.2Escrow Fund.

a.Simultaneous with the execution and delivery of this Escrow Agreement, Buyer
is depositing with the Escrow Agent the Adjustment Escrow Amount in
immediately available funds. The Escrow Agent hereby acknowledges receipt on
the date hereof of immediately available funds in the amount of the Adjustment
Escrow Amount.

b.The Escrow Agent hereby agrees that it shall not distribute any portion of
the Adjustment Escrow Account to any Person, except in accordance with the
terms of this Escrow Agreement. c.The Escrow Fund shall not be subject to lien or attachment by any creditor
of any party hereto and shall not be available to, and shall not be used by,
the Escrow Agent to set off any party hereto owing to the Escrow Agent in any
other capacity.

Section 1.3Investments.

a.Unless otherwise jointly instructed in writing by the Parties, the Escrow
Agent shall invest and reinvest the Escrow Fund in an interest-bearing deposit
account with an initial annual interest rate of .05 basis points (0.05%). The
deposits held in such deposit account shall be insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") to the applicable limits. The Parties
acknowledge that the initial interest rate is subject to change from time to
time, and any such rate changes will be reflected in the monthly statement
provided to the Parties. The Escrow Fund shall at all times remain available
for disbursement or release as may be jointly instructed in writing by the
Parties in accordance with this Escrow Agreement. Any Earnings on the Escrow
Fund shall be retained by the Escrow Agent and reinvested in the Escrow Fund
and shall become part of the Escrow Fund and be disbursed only in accordance
with Section 1.4 and Section 1.5 of this Escrow Agreement.

b.For purposes of this Escrow Agreement, "Earnings" means, with respect to the
Escrow Fund or any portion thereof on any particular date, the interest,
dividends, gains and any other income earned on such amount from the date
hereof through such date in accordance with the terms hereof.

c.On a monthly basis, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to each of Buyer and
Seller a written statement setting forth the balance of the Adjustment Escrow
Account, all Earnings earned thereon and all distributions made therefrom,
which statement shall be delivered to each of Buyer and Seller in accordance
with Section 4.3 hereof.

Section 1.4Disbursements to Buyer; Releases to Seller. The Escrow Fund shall
be disbursed and released only as follows and pursuant to Section 1.4(a)
hereunder:

a.Disbursement and Release from the Adjustment Escrow Account. The amounts
held in the Adjustment Escrow Account shall be released to Seller, on the one
hand, or disbursed to Buyer, on the other hand, in such amounts and at such
times as are set forth in Sections 2.3(e), 2.3(f) and 2.3(g) of the Purchase
Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall, within two (2) Business Days after the
determination of the Final Closing Statement, deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to pay such
amounts to Seller, Buyer or both, as the case may be, in accordance with such
Sections 2.3(e), 2.3(f) and 2.3(g). The Escrow Agent shall pay such amounts to
the relevant parties no later than two (2) Business Days following delivery of
such joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent.

b.It is understood and agreed that the Escrow Agent shall in no way be
responsible for performing any calculations or determining the amounts to be
paid or released under this Section 1.4 (other than confirming the remaining
balance of the Adjustment Escrow Account as of the applicable time).

c.Any amount disbursed to Buyer (or a designee, successor or permitted
assignee thereof), or released to Seller (or a designee, successor or
permitted assign thereof), as applicable, from the Adjustment Escrow Account
in accordance with the terms hereof shall no longer be deemed a part of the
Escrow Fund or otherwise be subject to the provisions of this Escrow
Agreement.

d.Each Party hereby agrees that it will cooperate with the other Party and the
Escrow Agent in good faith in executing any joint instructions in writing as
reasonably required pursuant to this Section 1.4 and in executing any joint
instructions in writing as reasonably required pursuant to this Section 1.4
and to ensure distributions or releases, as the case may be, of the Escrow
Fund to the relevant Party entitled thereto under the terms of the Purchase
Agreement.

e.Any disbursement or release of the Escrow Fund shall be made from the
Adjustment Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent to Buyer (or a designee,
successor or permitted assignee thereof) or Seller (or a designee, successor
or permitted assignee thereof), as applicable, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in accordance with the wire transfer instructions specified in
the joint written instructions provided by the Parties to the Escrow Agent.

Section 1.5Income Tax Allocation and Reporting. a.The Parties agree that, for tax reporting purposes, all Earnings shall, as
of the end of each calendar year and to the extent required by the Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS"), be reported as having been earned by Seller whether
or not such income was disbursed during such calendar year. The Escrow Agent
shall report any interest or income earned on the Escrow Funds, if any, to the
IRS or other taxing authority on IRS Form 1099.

b.Prior to the date hereof, the Parties have provided the Escrow Agent with
certified tax identification numbers by furnishing appropriate IRS Forms W-9
or W-8, as applicable, and such other forms and documents that the Escrow
Agent has reasonably requested. The Parties understand that, if such tax
reporting documentation is not provided to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent
may be required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, to withhold a portion of any interest or
other income earned on the investment of the Escrow Fund.

by Seller), shall indemnify, defend and hold the Escrow Agent harmless from
and against any tax, late payment, interest, penalty or other cost or expense
that may be assessed against the Escrow Agent on or with respect to the Escrow
Fund and the investment thereof unless such tax, late payment, interest,
penalty or other expense arose from bad faith, gross negligence, willful
misconduct, fraud, or material breach of this Escrow Agreement by the Escrow
Agent; provided, however, that to the extent the Escrow Agent is entitled to
any indemnification pursuant to this Section 1.5(c) resulting from a Party's
failure to provide a fully executed IRS Form W-8, W-9 and/or other required
documentation pursuant to Section 1.5(b) or as requested by the Escrow Agent
from such Party, such Party shall be solely responsible for indemnifying the
Escrow Agent for such taxes, late payments, interest, penalties, or other
costs or expenses assessed against the Escrow Agent. The indemnification
provided by this Section 1.5(c) is in addition to the indemnification provided
in Section 3.1 and shall survive the resignation or removal of the Escrow
Agent and the termination of this Escrow Agreement.

Section 1.6Termination. Upon the disbursement or release of all of the Escrow
Fund, including any Earnings thereon, this Escrow Agreement shall terminate
and be of no further force and effect, except that the provisions of Sections
1.5(c), 3.1 and 3.2 hereof shall survive termination.



ARTICLE 2

DUTIES OF THE ESCROW AGENT



Section 2.1Scope of Responsibility. Notwithstanding any provision herein to
the contrary, the Escrow Agent is obligated to perform only the duties
specifically set forth in this Escrow Agreement, which shall be deemed purely
ministerial in nature, and no duties, including but not limited to any
fiduciary duties, shall be implied. Under no circumstances will the Escrow
Agent be responsible or liable for the failure of either Party to perform in
accordance with this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall neither be
responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of the terms and conditions of
any other agreement, instrument or document other than this Escrow Agreement,
whether or not an original or a copy of such agreement has been provided to
the Escrow Agent, and the Escrow Agent shall have no duty to know or inquire
as to the performance or nonperformance of any provision of any other
agreement, instrument or document other than this Escrow Agreement.
Notwithstanding the terms of any other agreement between the Parties, the
terms and conditions of this Agreement will control the actions of Escrow
Agent. References in this Escrow Agreement to any other agreement, instrument
or document are for the convenience of the Parties, and the Escrow Agent has
no duties or obligations with respect thereto. This Escrow Agreement sets
forth all matters pertinent to the escrow contemplated hereunder, and no
additional obligations of the Escrow Agent shall be inferred or implied from
the terms of this Escrow Agreement or any other agreement.

Section 2.2Attorneys and Agents. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely
on, and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the
Escrow Agent in good faith in accordance with, the advice of outside counsel;
provided that such action or inaction is not inconsistent with the terms of
this Escrow Agreement or the obligations of the Escrow Agent hereunder. The Escrow
Agent shall be reimbursed to the extent provided under Section 3.1 for any and
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, expenses and other costs
actually paid to one such outside counsel. The Escrow Agent may perform any
and all of its duties through its agents, representatives, attorneys,
custodians and/or nominees.

Section 2.3Reliance. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken
or not taken by it in accordance with the direction or consent of the Parties
or their respective agents, representatives, successors or assigns. The Escrow
Agent shall not be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon any
notice, request, consent, direction, requisition, certificate, order,
affidavit, letter or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed and presented by the proper authorized person
or persons on behalf of the applicable Party. Concurrently with the execution
of this Escrow Agreement, the Parties have delivered to the Escrow Agent
authorized signers' forms in the form of Exhibit A-1 and Exhibit A-2 to this
Escrow Agreement, in each case, as may be amended or supplemented from time to
time with the written consent of the applicable Party.

Section 2.4Right Not Duty Undertaken. The permissive rights of the Escrow
Agent to do things enumerated in this Escrow Agreement shall not be construed
as duties.

Section 2.5No Financial Obligation. No provision of this Escrow Agreement
shall require the Escrow Agent to risk or advance its own funds or otherwise
incur any financial liability or potential financial liability in the
performance of its duties or the exercise of its rights under this Escrow
Agreement.



ARTICLE 3

PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE ESCROW AGENT



Section 3.1Indemnification. The Parties, severally and not jointly (i.e. one-
half by Buyer and one-half by Seller), shall indemnify the Escrow Agent from
and against any and all loss, liability, cost, damage and out-of-pocket
expense (including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorney's fees and
expenses of one outside counsel) which the Escrow Agent may suffer or incur by
reason of any action, claim or proceeding brought against the Escrow Agent,
arising out of or relating to this Escrow Agreement or any transaction to
which this Escrow Agreement relates, in each case except to the extent caused
by the Escrow Agent's bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud,
or material breach of this Escrow Agreement. The provisions of this Section
3.1 and Section 3.2 shall survive the termination of this Escrow Agreement or
the earlier resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent.

Section 3.2LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. THE ESCROW AGENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE,
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES ARISING OUT OF THE
SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER, OTHER THAN DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES TO THE
EXTENT ARISING FROM THE ESCROW AGENT'S BAD FAITH, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT, FRAUD, OR MATERIAL BREACH OF THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT
SHALL EITHER PARTY OR THE ESCROW AGENT BE LIABLE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING LOST
PROFITS), EVEN IF THE PARTY OR THE ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION IN
WHICH SUCH DAMAGES ARE SOUGHT.

Section 3.3Resignation or Removal. Subject to the remainder of this Section
3.3, the Escrow Agent may resign by furnishing a written notice of its
resignation to the Parties, and the Parties may remove the Escrow Agent, with
or without cause, by furnishing to the Escrow Agent a joint written notice of
its removal along with payment of all fees and expenses to which it is
entitled through the date of termination. Such resignation or removal, as the
case may be, shall be effective thirty (30) days after the delivery of such
notice or upon the earlier appointment of a successor, and the Escrow Agent's
sole responsibility thereafter shall be to safely keep the Escrow Fund and to deliver the same to a successor
escrow agent as shall be appointed by mutual agreement of the Parties, as
evidenced by a joint written notice filed with the Escrow Agent, or in
accordance with a court order. If the Parties have failed to appoint a
successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days following
the delivery of such notice of resignation or removal, the Escrow Agent may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and any such resulting
appointment shall be binding upon the Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, no
resignation by the Escrow Agent shall be effective prior to the appointment of
a successor escrow agent. Upon appointment of the successor escrow agent, the
Escrow Agent shall forward all documents and the Escrow Fund to the successor.

Section 3.4Disposition of Any Adjustment Escrow Account By Agreement of the
Parties; Conflicting Demands.

a.The Escrow Agent may dispose of all or a portion of the Escrow Fund in
accordance with a joint written instruction signed by Buyer and Seller,
whether such disposition is pursuant to the terms of this Escrow Agreement or
otherwise. If any conflict, disagreement or dispute arises between, among or
involving any of the parties hereto concerning the meaning or validity of any
provision hereunder or concerning any other matter relating to this Escrow
Agreement, or the Escrow Agent is in doubt as to the action to be taken
hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to retain the applicable portion
of the Escrow Fund until (i) such conflicting or adverse claims or demands
shall have been determined by a final order, judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction or a final arbitration decision or settled by agreement
between the conflicting parties as evidenced in a writing executed by such
parties, in which event the Escrow Agent shall be authorized to disburse the
Escrow Fund in accordance with such final court order, judgment or decree or
arbitration decision or agreement, or (ii) the Escrow Agent shall have
received security or an indemnity satisfactory to it sufficient to hold it
harmless from and against any and all losses which it may incur by reason of
so acting. The Escrow Agent shall act on any such court order, judgment or
decree or arbitration decision without further question.

b.The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for the contents of any
writing of the arbitrators or any third party contemplated herein as a means
to resolve disputes and may conclusively rely without any liability upon the
contents thereof.

Section 3.5Compensation. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to compensation
for its services as stated in the fee schedule attached hereto as Exhibit B,
which compensation shall be borne one-half by Seller and one-half by Buyer.
The fee agreed upon for the services rendered hereunder is intended as full
compensation for the Escrow Agent's services as contemplated by this Escrow
Agreement. In the event that the Escrow Agent renders any service not
contemplated in this Escrow Agreement as requested by the Parties, or there is
any material expansion of the subject matter of the Escrow Agreement, or any
material modification of the Escrow Agreement that requires additional
services by the Escrow Agent, in each case, as agreed and directed by the
Parties, then the Escrow Agent shall be compensated for such extraordinary
services (which compensation shall be agreed to by each of the Parties and the
Escrow Agent) and reimbursed for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses, including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
attorneys' fees and expenses of one outside counsel, occasioned by any such
extraordinary services.

Section 3.6Merger or Consolidation. Any corporation or association into which
the Escrow Agent may be converted or merged, or with which it may be
consolidated, or to which it may sell or transfer all or substantially all of
its business and assets as a whole or substantially as a whole, or any
corporation or association resulting from any such conversion, sale, merger,
consolidation or transfer to which the Escrow Agent is a party, shall be and
become the successor escrow agent under this Escrow Agreement and shall have
and succeed to the rights, obligations, powers, duties, immunities and
privileges as its predecessor, without the execution or filing of any
instrument or paper or the performance of any further act; provided, that the
Escrow Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Parties
with prior written notice of any such conversion, sale, merger, consolidation
or transfer. Section 3.7Attachment of Escrow Fund; Compliance with Legal Orders. In the
event that the Escrow Fund shall be attached, garnished or levied upon by any
court order, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order
of a court, or any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any
court order affecting the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent is hereby expressly
authorized, in its sole discretion, to respond as it deems appropriate or to
comply with all writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, or which it is
advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with
or without jurisdiction; provided that the Escrow Agent shall provide a prior
written notice thereof to the Parties as soon as reasonably practicable. In
the event that the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such writ, order or
decree, it shall not be liable to any of the Parties or to any other person,
firm or corporation by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding that such
writ, order or decree is subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside
or vacated.

Section 3.8Force Majeure. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible or liable
for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligation under this
Escrow Agreement to the extent caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable
control, including acts of God; earthquakes; fire; flood; wars; acts of
terrorism; civil or military disturbances; sabotage; epidemic; riots;
interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities or communications services;
labor disputes; acts of civil or military authority or governmental action; it
being understood that in any such case the Escrow Agent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking
industry to resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable under the
circumstances and to mitigate the adverse impact of such circumstances.



ARTICLE 4

MISCELLANEOUS



Section 4.1Successors and Assigns. This Escrow Agreement shall be binding on
and inure to the benefit of the Parties and the Escrow Agent and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. No other persons shall have any
rights under this Escrow Agreement. No assignment of the interest of any of
the Parties shall be binding unless and until written notice of such
assignment shall be delivered to the other Party and the Escrow Agent and the
prior written consent of the other Party shall be obtained (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld); provided that Buyer may (a) assign any or all of
its rights and interests hereunder, but not its obligations hereunder, to one
or more of its Affiliates or to any lender providing financing for the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and (b) designate one or
more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder; provided,
however, that in either case of clause (a) or (b), Buyer shall remain
responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder. The Escrow Agent
shall not assign all or any portion of its rights or obligations under this
Escrow Agreement without the prior written consent of the Parties, and any
attempted assignment without the prior written consent of the Parties shall be
null and void. To comply with federal law including requirements of the USA
PATRIOT Act, successors and permitted assigns and designees of each Party
shall provide to the Escrow Agent the appropriate IRS Forms W-9 or W-8, as
applicable, and such other forms and documentation that the Escrow Agent may
request to verify identification and authorization to act.

Section 4.2Escheat. The Parties are aware that under applicable state law,
property which is presumed abandoned may under certain circumstances escheat
to the applicable state. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability to the
Parties, their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and
assigns, or any other party, should any or all of the Escrow Fund escheat by
operation of law.

Section 4.3Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other communications

address or other information for the purpose of notices to such party by
giving written notice in a manner provided in this Section 4.3 specifying such

Section 4.4Governing Law. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract, tort or statute) that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be
governed by, and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws of the State
of Delaware, including its statutes of limitations.

Section 4.5Consent to Jurisdiction. Any judicial proceeding involving any
dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought only in a federal or
state court located in the State of Delaware, and each of the parties hereto
(a) unconditionally accepts the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and any
related appellate court and irrevocably agrees to be bound by any judgment
rendered thereby and (b) irrevocably waives any objection such party may now
have or hereafter has as to the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a
court or that such court is an inconvenience forum. Each party hereto
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in Section 4.3. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party
hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

Section 4.6Entire Agreement; Severability. This Escrow Agreement, the Exhibits
attached hereto and the Purchase Agreement (in the case of the Purchase
Agreement, solely as it applies to the Parties), set forth the entire
agreement and understanding of the parties hereto related to the Escrow Fund
and the Adjustment Escrow Account and supersede all prior and contemporaneous
understandings, agreements, communications and representations of the parties
or their representatives, oral or written, that may relate in any way to the
subject matter hereof. If any provision of this Escrow Agreement is determined
to be prohibited or unenforceable by reason of any applicable law of a
jurisdiction, then such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions thereof and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in such jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provisions in any other jurisdiction.

Section 4.7Amendment. This Escrow Agreement may be amended, modified,
superseded, rescinded or canceled only by a written instrument executed by
each of the Parties and the Escrow Agent; provided that any Party may amend
its notice address in accordance with Section 4.3; provided, further that the
Escrow Agent's signature shall be required only to the extent an amendment
affects the Escrow Agent's rights or obligations pursuant to this Escrow
Agreement.

Section 4.8Waivers. The failure of any party to this Escrow Agreement at any
time or times to require performance of any provision under this Escrow
Agreement shall in no manner affect the right at a later time to enforce the
same performance. A waiver by any party to this Escrow Agreement of any such
condition or breach of any term, covenant, representation, or warranty
contained in this Escrow Agreement, in any one or more instances, must be in
writing in order to be effective and shall neither be construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach nor a waiver of
any other condition or breach of any other term, covenant, representation or
warranty contained in this Escrow Agreement.

Section 4.9Headings. Section headings in this Escrow Agreement have been
inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no way restrict or
otherwise modify any of the terms or provisions of this Escrow Agreement.

Section 4.10No Third Parties Benefitted. Nothing expressed or implied in this
Escrow Agreement is intended, or shall be construed, to confer upon or give
any person or entity other than Buyer, Seller and the Escrow Agent any rights
or action under, or by reason of, this Escrow Agreement, except for their
respective successors or permitted assigns or designees (including assignees
of Buyer permitted under Section 4.1).

Section 4.11Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Escrow Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which when executed shall be
deemed to be an original, and such counterparts shall together constitute one
and the same instrument. All signatures of the parties to this Escrow
Agreement may be transmitted by facsimile or electronic transmission in
portable document format (".pdf") and such facsimile or .pdf will, for all
purposes, be deemed to be the original signature of such party whose signature
it reproduces and will be binding upon such party.

Section 4.12WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING TO WHICH THEY ARE
PARTIES INVOLVING ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Section 4.13Use of Name. No publicly distributed printed or other materials in
any language, including prospectuses, notices, reports and promotional
materials, which mention "Citibank" by name or the rights, powers or duties of
the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement shall be issued by the Parties,
or on such Party's behalf, without the prior written consent of the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Parties, issue, distribute, or make, or cause to be issued, distributed or
made, any public announcement, press release, advertisement or other
non‑confidential communication that mentions or refers to Seller, Buyer or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 4.14USA PATRIOT Act Section 326 Customer Identification Program. The
parties hereto acknowledge that, in order to help the United States government
fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, pursuant to
federal regulations that became effective on October 1, 2003, Section 326 of
the USA PATRIOT Act requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify,
record and update information that identifies each person establishing a
relationship or opening an account. The parties to this Escrow Agreement agree
that they will provide to the Escrow Agent such information as it may request,
from time to time, in order for the Escrow Agent to satisfy the requirements
of the USA PATRIOT Act, including but not limited to the name, address, tax
identification number and other information that will allow it to identify the
individual or entity who is establishing the relationship or opening the
account, and the Escrow Agent may also ask for formation documents such as
articles of incorporation or other identifying documents to be provided.

Section 4.15Publication; Disclosure. By executing this Escrow Agreement, the
Escrow Agent acknowledges that this Escrow Agreement (including related
attachments) contains certain information that is sensitive and confidential
in nature and agrees that such information needs to be protected from improper
disclosure, including the publication or dissemination of this Escrow
Agreement and related information to individuals or entities not a party to
this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent further agrees to take reasonable
measures to mitigate any risks associated with the publication or disclosure
of this Escrow Agreement and information contained herein. If the Escrow Agent
is required to disclose or publish this Escrow Agreement or information
contained herein pursuant to any regulatory, statutory or governmental
requirement, as well as any judicial or administrative order, subpoena or
discovery request, to the extent practicable, it shall notify the Parties in
writing concurrently with or promptly after such disclosure. If the Escrow
Agent becomes aware of any threatened or actual unauthorized disclosure,
publication or use of this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall promptly notify the Parties in
writing and shall be liable for any unauthorized release or disclosure by the
Escrow Agent.
