with the exception of this Agreement, by the other Transaction Agreements (as
defined below) (all such transactions being referred to collectively as the
"Spin-Off");   WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have determined that it is in the best
interests of their respective entities and shareholders to enter into this
Agreement and have approved and adopted this Agreement and the merger of

WHEREAS, in making the foregoing determinations, the board of directors of
the Company considered, among other things, the interests of the Company\'s

desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
in connection with this Agreement and the Distribution Agreement (this
Agreement, the Distribution Agreement  10 and the other agreements and term
sheets attached hereto or thereto sometimes being hereinafter collectively
referred to as the "Transaction Agreements"); and   WHEREAS, for federal

Consideration. Each share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company ("Common Stock"), including the associated right to purchase one one-
hundredth of a share of Class B Voting Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per
share ("Class B Voting Preferred Stock"), of the Company (each a "Right" and,
together with Common Stock, a "Share" or, collectively, the "Shares") issued
pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of September 24, 1999, between the
Company and First Chicago Trust Company of New York, as Rights Agent (the
"Rights Agreement"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than (i) Shares owned by or on behalf of ING, Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of ING (collectively, the "ING Companies")
or Shares that are owned by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company and in each case not held on behalf of third parties or (ii)
Shares ("Dissenting Shares") that are owned by shareholders ("Dissenting
Shareholders") exercising dissenter\'s rights pursuant to Sections 33-855
through 33-872 of the CBCA (each such Share owned by or on behalf of the ING
Companies, the Company and any Subsidiary of the Company and each
Dissenting Share, an "Excluded Share" and collectively, the "Excluded
Shares")) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash per
Share equal to (x) $7.70 billion (i) minus the greater of (A) $2.678 billion
(which amount shall be reduced by $300 million if the $300 million
outstanding principal amount of the 6.75% Notes of Aetna Services, Inc. due
2001 due and payable on August 15, 2001 is repaid in full on such maturity
date) and (B) the aggregate principal amount of all Long-Term Debt (as
defined below) outstanding as of the Effective Time to any Person (other than
obligations for indebtedness set forth in Section 4.1(a)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter) (such amount being the "Assumed Long-Term Debt   -4- 
13 Obligations"), (ii) plus the Net Capital Contribution Amount (positive
or negative), (iii) plus the Net Interest Accrual Amount (positive or
negative) and (iv) minus the CityPlace Accrual Amount divided by (y) the
aggregate number of outstanding Shares as of the Effective Time (the "Merger
Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
or other similar evidence of ownership of uncertificated Shares (such
certificate or similar evidence of ownership of uncertificated Shares being
referred to herein as a "Certificate") formerly representing any of such
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right
to the Merger Consideration. "Net Capital Contribution Amount" means an
amount determined as of the Effective Time for the period after March 31,
2000 until the Effective Time that is equal to the aggregate cash capital
contributions (other than Excluded Capital Contributions (as defined below))
made (without duplication) after March 31, 2000 by the Company or Aetna
Services, Inc. to Aetna Retirement Services, Inc., Aetna International, Inc.
or any of their respective Subsidiaries from among the permitted capital
contributions included in Section 4.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter
minus the amount of any dividends or distributions (other than Excluded
Dividends) paid (without duplication) after March 31, 2000 from
Aetna Retirement Services, Inc., or Aetna International, Inc. or any of
their respective Subsidiaries (other than Subsidiaries that are not
Subsidiaries of the Company) to Aetna Services, Inc. (other than any such
dividends and distributions paid in respect of the proceeds (after Taxes and
transaction expenses incurred in connection therewith) (the "Permitted Sales
Proceeds") received from the sale or disposition of (i) Inversiones
Mercantile-Aetna C.A. and (ii) the Company\'s direct or indirect interest in
Kwang Hua Securities Investment and Trust Co. and Kwang Hua Securities
Investment Consultant Co. Ltd. (the items referred to in clauses (i) and (ii)
collectively, the "Permitted Sales")). The term "Long-Term Debt" means
indebtedness for borrowed money, the term of which, when incurred, had a
maturity date of one year or more, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
The term "Excluded Capital Contribution" means any portion of any capital
contribution made, directly or indirectly, to Spinco or any of its
Subsidiaries. The term "Excluded Dividends" means cash dividends or other
cash distributions, funds for which were originally provided by Subsidiaries
of Aetna Retirement Services, Inc. or Aetna International, Inc. that are also
Subsidiaries of Spinco, net of any Tax cost to any of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. The term "Net Interest Accrual Amount" means the
amount (positive or negative) equal to the Parent Interest Portion minus the
Closing Date Interest Accrual. The term "CityPlace Accrual Amount" means an
amount equal to the next aggregate semi-annual lease payment of the Company
and its Subsidiaries payable in respect of the the CityPlace building to be
made after the Effective Time multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the total number of days elapsed since the immediately preceding October
31 or March 30 until the Effective Time and the denominator of which is 180.
"Parent Interest Portion" shall mean an amount equal to the amount of
interest that would accrue (in a manner consistent with accruals on the
Assumed Long-Term Debt Obligations) on $1 billion (one   -5-  14 billion
dollars) principal amount of indebtedness bearing an annual interest rate of
7.1% from and including April 1, 2000 to the Effective Time. "Closing Date
Interest Accrual" shall mean the amount of interest accrued as of
the Effective Time in respect of the Assumed Long-Term Debt Obligations.  
(b) The Merger and the Spin-Off shall be effected such that the shares of
Spinco to be distributed in the Spin-Off and the Merger Consideration are
distributed or paid, as the case may be, only to the same holder of a share
of Common Stock.   (c) Cancellation of Shares. Each Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned by or on behalf
of any of the ING Companies or owned by the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company (in each case other than Shares that are held on behalf of third
parties) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, no longer be outstanding and shall be canceled and
retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to
exist.   (d) Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.   4.2 Exchange of Cash for Shares.   (a)
Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, ING shall cause Parent or an
Affiliate of Parent to deposit with First Chicago Trust Company of New York
(the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares) upon due surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this Article IV (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund").   The funds deposited
with the Paying Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent as Parent shall
reasonably direct, and any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as Parent directs.   (b) Payment Procedures. Promptly after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded
Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to
the Paying Agent, such   -6-  15 letter of transmittal to be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably
agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (and affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation (or
due submission of an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate (or submitter of such affidavit, as the case may be) shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, a check in the amount (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings) of the number of Shares represented
by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) multiplied by the
Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender (after giving effect to any required Tax withholding) of
the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash
to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented
to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable.   For the purposes of this Agreement,
the term "Person" shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-
profit corporations), general or limited partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization,
Governmental Entity (as defined below) or other entity of any kind or
nature.   (c) Transfers. After the Effective Time, there shall be
no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.   If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent for transfer, they shall be canceled and, provided the Merger
Consideration provided thereon has not escheated to the relevant Governmental
Entity (as defined below), exchanged for a check (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholding) in the proper amount pursuant to this Article
IV.   (d) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including the profit, interest or income from any investments thereof) that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
for one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent or as
directed by Parent. Any holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who
have not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only
to Parent for payment of (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings) the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of their
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other    -7-  16 Person shall be
liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.   (e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event
any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in
the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) of the
number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
multiplied by the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of, and deliverable
in respect of the Shares represented by, such Certificate pursuant to this
Agreement.   (f) Withholding of Tax. Parent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any former holder of Shares such amounts as Parent (or any
affiliate thereof) is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code") or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law (as defined below). Such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the former holders of Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.   4.3 Dissenters\' Rights. Any Person
who otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting Shareholder shall not be entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such
Person unless and until such Person shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder\'s right to dissent from the
Merger under the CBCA. Each Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to
receive only the payment determined pursuant to Sections 33-855 through
33-872 of the CBCA with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting
Shareholder. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
dissenters\' demands, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company
relating to dissenters\' rights and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to dissenters\' demands under
the CBCA. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any dissenters\' demands
for payment for Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve
any withdrawal of any such demands. If, after the Effective Time, such
Dissenting Shareholder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses its right to
demand the payment of fair value for its Shares under the CBCA, such Shares
shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into
a right to receive the Merger Consideration and ING shall cause Parent to
promptly thereafter deposit, or cause to be    -8-  17 deposited, with
the Paying Agent, for the benefit of such Dissenting Stockholder, cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all such
Shares.    ARTICLE V   Representations and Warranties   5.1

Insurance Companies) comparable report, except, in the case of each

is not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company and each of the Retained Insurance Companies have made all required
filings under applicable Insurance Laws (as defined below) except where the
failure to file is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (iii) Joint Ventures. Section

of Common Stock have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable. The Company has no shares of Common Stock or Preferred
Shares reserved for or otherwise subject to issuance, except that, as of the

-12-  21  authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and

other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital
stock or other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations
evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. The Company
does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations
the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into or
exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the shareholders of
the Company on any matter ("Voting Debt").   (c) Corporate Authority;
Approval and Fairness. (i) The Company has, and Spinco will have prior to the
Effective Time, all requisite corporate power and authority and the Company
has, and Spinco will have prior to the Effective Time, taken all corporate
action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under the Transaction Agreements to which it is or will be a party and to
consummate, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Transaction
Agreements, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, subject only to
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the
holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (the
"Company Requisite Vote"). Each Transaction Agreement to which the Company or
Spinco is or will be a party, when executed by such party, will be a valid
and binding agreement of such party enforceable against such party in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors\' rights and to the rights
of creditors of insurance companies generally and to general
equity principles (the "Bankruptcy and Equity Exception").   (ii) The board
of directors of the Company (A) has, and, in the case of Spinco, the Board of
Directors of Spinco will have prior to the Effective Time, unanimously
approved the Transaction Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby
and (B) has declared that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, taken as a whole, are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of
the holders of shares of Common Stock. In taking such action, the Board of
Directors of the Company considered, among other things, the interests of the
Company\'s employees, customers, creditors and suppliers as well as community
and societal considerations. The board of directors of the Company has also
has received the opinions of its financial advisors, Donaldson Lufkin and
Jenrette Securities Corporation and Goldman, Sachs and Co., to the effect that
the      -13-  22 consideration to be received by the holders of shares
of Common Stock in the Merger is fair from a financial point of view to the
holders of shares of Common Stock.   (d) Governmental Filings; No
Violations. (i) Other than the reports, filings, registrations, consents,

management of pension plans, (O) with applicable state regulatory authorities
governing investments advisors, (P) with the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (the "PBGC") (Q) required to be obtained from any Governmental

IRS in connection with certain transfers contemplated by the Employee
Benefits Agreement (as defined below), no notices, reports or other filings
are required to be made by the Company, Spinco or any of their Subsidiaries
or any Joint Ventures with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals,
permits, applications, expiry of waiting periods or authorizations required
to be obtained by the Company, Spinco or any of their Subsidiaries or any
Joint Ventures from, any U.S. or non-U.S. governmental or regulatory
authority, agency, commission, tribunal, body or other governmental, quasi-
governmental or self-regulatory entity (each, a "Governmental Entity"), in
connection with the execution and delivery of the Transaction Agreements by
the Company and Spinco and the consummation by the Company and Spinco of the
Merger, the Spin-Off and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, except those that the failure to make or obtain are not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent,      -14-  23 materially
delay or materially impair the ability of the Company or Spinco to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements.   (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of
each Transaction Agreement by the Company (and in the case of the
Distribution Agreement, Spinco) does not, and the consummation by the Company
(and in the case of the Distribution Agreement, Spinco) of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not, constitute or
result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate
or by-laws of Spinco or the Company or the comparable governing instruments
of any of the Company\'s or Spinco\'s Subsidiaries or any Joint Ventures, (B)
a breach or violation of, or a default under, the acceleration of any rights
or obligations or the creation of a lien, pledge, security interest, claim or
other encumbrance on the assets of Spinco, the Company or any of the
Company\'s or Spinco\'s Subsidiaries or any Joint Ventures (with or without
notice, lapse of time or both) pursuant to, any agreement, lease, non-
governmental license, contract, treaty, note, mortgage, indenture, non-
governmental franchise, non-governmental permit, concession, arrangement or
other non-governmental obligation ("Contracts") binding upon Spinco, the
Company or any of the Company\'s or Spinco\'s Subsidiaries or any Joint
Ventures or, assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section
5.1(d)(i), any Law (as defined below), or any governmental or non-
governmental permit, franchise or license to which Spinco, the Company or any
of the Company\'s or Spinco\'s Subsidiaries or any Joint Ventures is subject
or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of any party under any of the
Contracts, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any breach,
violation, default, acceleration, creation or change that is
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
ability of the Company or Spinco to consummate the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Agreements. The payment of the Merger Consideration in the
Merger and distribution of the shares of Spinco to be distributed in the
Spin-Off only to the same holder of a share of Common Stock (as described in
Section 4.1(b) of this Agreement) is capable of being effected in accordance
with Law.   (e) Statutory Reports; Company Reports; Financial
Statements. (i) Since January 1, 1997, each of the Retained Insurance
Companies has filed all annual or quarterly statements, together with all
exhibits, interrogatories, notes, actuarial opinions, affirmations,
certifications, schedules or other supporting documents in connection
therewith, required to be filed with or submitted to the appropriate
regulatory authorities of the jurisdiction in which it is, or was for the
period of time covered by the filing, domiciled or "commercially domiciled"
on forms prescribed or permitted by such authority (in the case of U.S.
Retained Insurance Companies and Aetna Life Insurance Company of America
("ALICA"), collectively, the "Company SAP Statements", and in the case of
International Retained Insurance Companies, other than
immaterial International Retained Insurance Companies, collectively the
"Foreign Company      -15-  24 Statements"). The Company has delivered
or made available to Parent all Company SAP Statements and all Foreign
Company Statements, in each case for the year ended December 31, 1999 each in
the form (including exhibits, annexes and any amendments thereto) filed with
the applicable insurance regulatory agency. Since January 1, 1997, the
financial statements included in the Company SAP Statements and Foreign
Company Statements for the periods from and after January 1, 1997, including
the notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with statutory or other
applicable accounting practices prescribed or permitted by
applicable regulatory authorities in effect as of the date of the respective
statements, and such accounting practices have been applied on a
substantially consistent basis throughout the periods involved, except as
expressly set forth in the notes or schedules thereto. Such financial
statements present fairly in all material respects the respective statutory
financial positions and results of operations of each of the Retained
Insurance Companies as of their respective dates and for the respective
periods presented therein. The Company SAP Statements and Foreign Company
Statements complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws when
filed, and no material deficiency has been asserted with respect to any
Company SAP Statements or Foreign Company Statements by the applicable
insurance regulatory body or other Governmental Entity. Except as indicated
therein, all assets that are reflected as admitted assets on the Company SAP
Statements and Foreign Company Statements , to the extent applicable, comply
in all material respects with all applicable Insurance Laws (as defined
below) with respect to admitted assets and are in an amount at least equal to
the minimum amounts required by applicable Insurance Laws. The statutory
balance sheets and statements of income, changes in financial position and
cash flow included in the Company SAP Statements for 1999 have been
audited by KPMG LLP and the Company has delivered or made available to Parent
true and complete copies of all audit opinions related thereto. To the extent
the balance sheets and statements of income, changes in financial position
and cash flow included in the Foreign Company Statements for 1999 have been
audited, the Company has delivered or made available to Parent true and
complete copies of all audit opinions related thereto. The Company has
delivered to Parent true and complete copies of all examinations and market
conduct reports or other comparable examinations or reports of insurance
departments and any insurance regulatory agencies since January 1, 1998
relating to the Retained Insurance Companies.   (ii) The Company has filed
with the SEC each registration statement, report, proxy statement or
information statement required to be filed by it since January 1, 1997,
including the 1999 10-K and the First 2000 10-Q, each in the form, when filed
(or if amended, as of the date of such amendment) (including exhibits,
annexes and any amendments thereto), promulgated by the SEC under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") or the Exchange Act
(collectively, with any other filings made with the SEC since January 1,
1997, and including any such registration statements, reports,
proxy statements and information statements filed subsequent to the date
hereof and as amended, the "Company Reports"). As of their respective dates
(or, if amended, as      -16-  25 of the date of such amendment), the
Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports filed with the SEC
subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.   (iii) Each of the
consolidated balance sheets included in the Company Reports (including the
related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects, or
will fairly present in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the
consolidated statements of income, shareholders\' equity and cash flows
included in the Company Reports (including any related notes and schedules)
fairly presents in all material respects, or will fairly present in all
material respects, the results of operations, retained earnings and
cash flows, as the case may be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
notes and normal year-end audit adjustments that will not be material in
amount or effect), in each case in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") consistently applied during the periods
involved, except as may be noted therein.   (iv) Section 5.1(e)(iv) of the
Company Disclosure Letter contains the unaudited pro forma consolidated
balance sheet of Spinco and its Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2000, together
with the related unaudited consolidated statement of income for the three-
month period then ended, and the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement
of income of Spinco and its Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31,
1999. Such statements present information as if the Spin-Off had occurred (on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Transaction
Agreements) as of the Balance Sheet Date or, with respect to the income
statements, as if the Spin-Off had occurred (on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Transaction Agreements) as of the beginning of
the period presented. Such statements are based on, and should be read in
conjunction with, the historical consolidated financial statements included
in the Company Reports. Such balance sheet fairly presents in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of Spinco and its Subsidiaries
as of its date, as if the Spin-Off had occurred (on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in the Transaction Agreements) on such date, and
each such consolidated statement of income, fairly presents in all
material respects the results of operations of Spinco and its Subsidiaries
for the periods set forth therein, as if the Spin-Off had occurred (on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Transaction Agreements)
as of the beginning of such period (subject to notes and normal year-end
audit adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect). The
accounts reflected in the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial
statements referred to in this subsection have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP on a basis consistent with the historical audited consolidated
financial statements of the Company and its      -17-  26 Subsidiaries
(including Spinco and its Subsidiaries) and were prepared in accordance with
the requirements of SEC Regulation S-X as it relates to pro forma financial
statements.   (v) Section 5.1(e)(v) of the Company Disclosure
Letter contains the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2000, together with the related
unaudited consolidated statement of income, for the three-month period then
ended, and the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of income of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 1999. Such
statements present information as if the Spin-Off had occurred (on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in the Transaction Agreements) as of
the Balance Sheet Date or, with respect to the income statements, as if the
Spin-Off had occurred (on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in the Transaction Agreements) as of the beginning of the period presented.
Such statements are based on, and should be read in conjunction with, the
historical consolidated financial statements included in the Company Reports.
Such balance sheet fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of its date, as if
the Spin-Off had occurred (on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Transaction Agreements) on such date, and each such consolidated
statement of income fairly presents in all material respects the results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth
therein, as if the Spin-Off had occurred (on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Transaction Agreements) as of the beginning of
such period (subject to notes and normal year-end audit adjustments that will
not be material in amount or effect). The accounts reflected in the unaudited
pro forma financial statements referred to in this subsection have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with the
historical audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including Spinco and its Subsidiaries) and were prepared in
accordance with the requirements of SEC Regulation S-X as it relates to pro
forma financial statements.   (f) Absence of Certain Changes. Except as
disclosed in the Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof or as
expressly contemplated by the Transaction Agreements or Section 6.1 hereof,

the extent relating solely to any member of the Spinco Group; (vi) any

ordinary course of business consistent with prior practice, (B) as was
required under employment agreements in effect as of the Balance Sheet Date
or (C) in connection with a promotion; (ix) any granting by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to any Designated Person of any increase in severance

any transfer or transaction that would have been prohibited by Section 6.1(l)
had it been in effect since March 31, 2000; provided, however, that the
limitations of clauses (vii) through (x) of this Section 5.1(f) shall not
apply to any actions taken in respect of any individual who, after giving
effect to the Spin-Off, will be an    -19-  28 executive officer,
director or employee of Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries (an "Excluded
Employee") if such actions do not adversely affect the Company and
its Subsidiaries and such limitations shall not apply to any actions taken
in respect of any other individual so long as any liabilities resulting from
such actions are the responsibility of Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries
(after giving effect to the Transaction Agreements). For purposes of the
proviso to this Section 5.1(f), an action will not be considered to adversely
affect the Company and its Subsidiaries if (i) the action is taken with
respect to an Excluded Employee whose employment arrangements expressly
provide that, upon consummation of the Spin-Off, any and all claims of such
Excluded Employee with respect to employment shall be brought only against
Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries and shall not be brought against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) if the aggregate liability for the
action (other than an action described in the foregoing clause (i)), together
with the aggregate liability for all actions other than those described in
the foregoing clause (i), determined in each case without regard to the
Transaction Agreements, is less than $10 million.   (g) Litigation and
Liabilities. (i) Except as disclosed in the Company Reports filed prior to
the date hereof, there are no civil, criminal or administrative actions,
suits, claims, hearings, investigations or proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against Spinco, the Company, their
respective Subsidiaries, any of the Joint Ventures or any of their respective
properties or assets except for those that are not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company or
Spinco to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements.   (ii) Set forth in Section 5.1(g)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter is a complete list, as of the date hereof, of all civil,
criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims (other than individual
customer complaints which are received in the ordinary course of business,
consistent with past practices, and as to which no suit, action or
arbitration has been commenced), hearings, investigations or proceedings
pending, or, to the actual knowledge of the people set forth in Section
5.1(g)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, threatened, against the Company
and its Subsidiaries (other than Aetna International, Inc. and its
Subsidiaries, the "International Entities"), any Joint Ventures and any joint
ventures of the Company or their properties or assets.   (iii) Set forth in
Section 5.1(g)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Letter is a complete list, as
of the date hereof, of each civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits,
claims (other than individual customer complaints which are received in the
ordinary course of business, consistent with past practices, and as to which
no suit, action or arbitration has been commenced), hearings, investigations
or proceedings pending, or, to the actual knowledge of the people set forth
in Section 5.1(g)(iii) of the Company      -20-  29 Disclosure Letter,
threatened, against the International Entities and the Joint Ventures or
their properties or assets, as to which, in each case, it is reasonably
likely to expect potential damages resulting therefrom to exceed $500,000,
net of applicable insurance and reserves.   (iv) As of the date hereof,
there is no litigation against any member of the Spinco Group which, net of
applicable insurance and reserves with respect thereto, is reasonably likely
to result in liability for amounts which would be material to the financial
condition of Spinco.   (v) Except for those obligations and liabilities that
are fully reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of
the Company included in the 1999 10-K or the First 2000 10-Q and for
obligations and liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with prior practice since March 31, 2000, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any obligations or liabilities of any
nature whatsoever, whether absolute, accrued, contingent, known, unknown or
otherwise and none of the Joint Ventures has incurred any obligation or
liabilities of any nature whatsoever, whether absolute, accrued, contingent
or otherwise and, in each case, whether or not required to be disclosed on a
balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP or statutory or other
applicable accounting principles, including those relating to matters
involving any Environmental Law (as defined below), or any other facts or
circumstances of which the Company has knowledge that could result in any
claims against, or obligations or liabilities of, the Company or any of
its Affiliates or Joint Ventures, except for those that are not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of the
Company or Spinco to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements. As used in the Agreement, each of the phrases (i) "of
which the Company has knowledge", (ii) "knowledge of the Company" and (iii)
"the Company has no knowledge" means the actual knowledge of those people set
forth on Section 5.1(g)(v) of the Company Disclosure Letter.   (h) Employee
Benefits. (i) A true and complete copy of each material employment benefit
and compensation plan, Contract, policy or arrangement, including each
"employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), bonus,
incentive, deferred compensation, employee stock ownership, stock bonus,
stock purchase, restricted stock, stock option, stock appreciation rights,
stock based, termination and severance plan, Contract, policy or arrangement
that covers employees, directors, agents, consultants, former employees or
former directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Compensation and
Benefit Plans") and any trust agreement or insurance contract forming a part
of such Compensation and Benefit Plans has been made available to Parent
prior to the date hereof. The Compensation and Benefit Plans are listed in
Section 5.1(h) of the      -21-  30 Company Disclosure Letter and any
"change of control" or similar provisions therein are specifically identified
in Section 5.1(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Except as provided in the
Transaction Agreements, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any commitment, oral or written, to create any additional material
Compensation and Benefit Plan or to modify or change any existing
Compensation and Benefit Plan in a material respect.   (ii) All Compensation
and Benefit Plans are in substantial compliance with all applicable Law,
including the Code and ERISA, and all required filings and disclosures with
respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan have been timely made. More
specifically, the Company and the Compensation and Benefit Plans have at all
times complied with Section 407 of ERISA with respect to the holding and
acquiring of "employer securities" and "qualifying employer securities" as
defined under ERISA. Each Compensation and Benefit Plan that is an "employee
pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension
Plan") and that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
(each, a "Qualified Plan"), has received a favorable determination letter
(including a determination that the related trust under such Compensation and
Benefit Plan is exempt from Tax under Section 501(a) of the Code) from the
Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with respect to "TRA" (as defined in
Section 1 of Revenue Procedure 93-39), and the Company is not aware of any
circumstances reasonably likely to result in revocation of any such favorable
determination letter. There is no material pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened legal action, suit, claim or
governmental investigation relating to any of the Compensation and Benefit
Plans, other than routine claims for benefits. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor Spinco nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a
transaction, or omitted to take any action, with respect to any Compensation
and Benefit Plan that, assuming the Taxable period of such transaction
expired as of the date hereof, could subject the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to a material Tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of
the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.   (iii) There is no material liability
under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA that has been incurred which has
not been satisfied and no such material liability is expected to be incurred
by the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to any ongoing, frozen or
terminated "single-employer plan", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15)
of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of them, or the single-
employer plan of any entity which is considered one employer with the Company
under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (such entity an "ERISA
Affiliate" and such plan an "ERISA Affiliate Plan"). The Company and its
Subsidiaries have not incurred any material withdrawal liability that has not
been satisfied and the Company does not expect that they will incur any such
material withdrawal liability with respect to any multiemployer plan under
Subtitle E to Title IV of ERISA. Neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor
any ERISA Affiliate has contributed, or been obligated to contribute, to
a      -22-  31  "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section
3(37) of ERISA within the last six calendar years. No notice of a "reportable
event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day
reporting requirement has not been waived, has been required to be filed for
any Pension Plan or any ERISA Affiliate Plan within the 12-month period
ending on the date hereof or, except in respect of the transactions
contemplated by the Transactions Agreements, will be required to be filed in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements.
The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any Pension Plan or
ERISA Affiliate Plan, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no condition
exists that presents a material risk that such proceedings will be
instituted.   (iv) All material contributions required to be made under
the terms of any Compensation and Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan as of
the date hereof have been timely made in accordance with such terms and
applicable Law and/or have been reflected on the most recent consolidated
balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company Reports prior
to the date hereof. Neither any Pension Plan nor any ERISA Affiliate Plan has
an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the
meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, and no ERISA
Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither the Company nor its
Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates nor Spinco nor its Subsidiaries or ERISA
Affiliates (x) has provided, or is required to provide, security to any
Pension Plan or to any ERISA Affiliate Plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of
the Code or (y) has taken any action, or omitted to take any action, that has
resulted, or is reasonably likely to result, in the imposition of a lien
under Section 412(a) of the Code or pursuant to ERISA.   (v) Under each
Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan and ERISA Affiliate Plan, as of
the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the
actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions contained in the Pension Plan\'s most recent actuarial
valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such Plan,
and as of the date hereof, there has been no material adverse change in the
financial condition of such Plan nor any amendment or other change to such
Plan that would materially increase the amount of benefits thereunder which
reasonably could be expected to change such result.   (vi) Except as
required by applicable Law, by the Transaction Agreements or pursuant to
individual agreements, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or
ERISA Affiliates have any obligations for retiree health and life benefits
under any Compensation and Benefit Plan. No action taken by the Company or
its Subsidiaries or Spinco or its Subsidiaries alters the Company\'s or its
Subsidiaries\' ability to amend or terminate any retiree health or life plan
in accordance with the written terms of such plan.       -23-  32 
(vii) The consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Agreements will not, without any other action (w) entitle
any employee, consultant or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any payment (including severance pay or similar compensation)
or any increase in compensation, (x) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or trigger any payment of compensation or benefits or the funding of
any trust under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material
obligation pursuant to, any of the Compensation and Benefit Plans or (y)
result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any of
the Compensation and Benefit Plans.   (viii) With respect to each
Compensation and Benefit Plan, if applicable, the Company has provided or
made available to Parent true and complete copies of (i) the most recent Form
5500 filed with the IRS; (ii) the most recent actuarial report and financial
statement; (iii) the most recent summary plan description; (iv) the forms
filed with the PBGC (other than for premium payments) since January 1, 1998;
(v) the most recent determination letter issued by the IRS; (vi) any Form
5310 or Form 5330 filed with the IRS; and (vii) the most recent
nondiscrimination tests performed under ERISA and the Code (including 401(k)
and 401(m) tests).   (ix) From March 31, 2000 through the date hereof, no
(i) Designated Persons or (ii) other employees of Aetna Retirement Services,
Inc. or Aetna International, Inc. or any of their Subsidiaries (that are
also Subsidiaries of the Company), Joint Ventures or joint ventures have
been transferred to or from the Company, Spinco, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or joint ventures or Aetna Services, Inc., other than transfers
of such other employees identified in clause (ii) in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices.   (i) Compliance with Laws;
Permits. (i) The business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and Joint Ventures have been conducted in compliance with all applicable
foreign, federal, state and local Laws regulating the business and products
of insurance, reinsurance and healthcare and all applicable orders and
directives of Insurance and Healthcare Authorities (including federal
authorities with respect to health maintenance organization and other health
and workmen\'s compensation products and variable insurance and annuity
products) and market conduct recommendations resulting from market conduct
examinations conducted by or on behalf of Insurance and Healthcare
Authorities (including federal authorities with respect to health maintenance
organization and other health and workmen\'s compensation products and
variable insurance and annuity products) (collectively, "Insurance
Laws"), except where the failure to so conduct such business and operations
is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of the preceding
sentence, except where the failure to do so is not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse     
-24-  33  Effect, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Joint
Ventures and, to the knowledge of the Company as of the date hereof, its
Agents (as defined below), have marketed, administered, sold and issued
insurance, reinsurance, healthcare and annuity products and guaranteed
investment contracts in compliance with all applicable Insurance Laws,

and guaranteed investment contracts. In addition, (X) there is no pending or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened charge by any Insurance and
Healthcare Authority that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Joint
Ventures has violated, nor any pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened investigation by any Insurance and Healthcare Authority with
respect to possible violations of any applicable Insurance Laws where such
violations are, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect; (Y) none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures is subject to any order or decree of any
Insurance and Healthcare Authority relating specifically to such Person (as
opposed to insurance companies generally) which is, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; and
(Z) the Company and its Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures have filed all
reports required to be filed with any Insurance and Healthcare Authority as
to which the failure to file such reports is, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.  
(ii) In addition to Insurance Laws, except as set forth in the Company
Reports filed prior to the date hereof, the businesses of each of Spinco, the
Company and the Company\'s Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures have not been, and
are not being, conducted in violation of any applicable federal, state, local
or foreign law, statute, ordinance, directive, rule, regulation, judgment,
order, injunction, decree, arbitration award, agency requirement, license or
permit of any Governmental Entity (collectively, "Laws"), except
for violations or possible violations that are not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect
or prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company
or Spinco to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Agreements. No investigation or review by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Joint
Ventures which would be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor has
any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same. To the
knowledge of the Company, no change is required in the Company\'s or any of
its Subsidiaries\' or Joint Ventures\' processes, properties or procedures in
connection with any such Laws, and the Company has not received any notice or
communication of any       -25-  34  noncompliance with any such Laws
that has not been cured as of the date hereof other than any such failure to
make changes or non-compliance which is not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Spinco, the Company and the Company\'s Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures each
has all permits, licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and
other governmental authorizations, consents and approvals necessary to
conduct its business as presently conducted except those the absence of which

incorporation and by-laws is, or at or following the Effective Time will be,

Except for situations which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (A) the Tax
treatment under the Code of all Retained Insurance Contracts (as defined
below) is and at all times has been in all material respects the same or more
favorable to the purchaser, policyholder or intended beneficiaries thereof as
the Tax treatment under the Code for which such Retained Insurance
Contracts qualified or purported to qualify at the time of their issuance or
purchase, except for changes resulting from changes to the Code which do not
affect such Retained Insurance Contracts due to the effective date thereof,
(B) each hardware, software and firmware product used by the Retained
Insurance Companies to maintain such Retained Insurance Contracts\'
qualification for the Tax treatment under the Code for which such Retained
Insurance Contracts qualified or purported to qualify at the time of their
issuance or purchase is and at all relevant times has been properly designed
and implemented to maintain such qualification, (C) each annuity contract
issued by the Retained Insurance Companies qualifies as an annuity contract
under Section 72 of the Code, (D) each life insurance policy which is a
Retained Insurance Contract qualifies as a life insurance contract for
federal income Tax purposes and any such policy which is a modified endowment
contract under Section 7702A of the Code (each, a "MEC") has been marketed as
such at all relevant times or the policyholder otherwise has consented to
such MEC status and (E) each of the Retained Insurance Companies is and at
all times has been the owner for federal income Tax purposes of the assets in
any segregated asset account underlying or supporting each variable annuity
contract and each variable insurance policy issued by it; provided, however,
that for purposes of this sentence and Section 5.1(l)(iv), (A) the term
Retained Insurance Companies shall include only Aetna Life Insurance and
Annuity Company and Aetna Insurance Company of America and (B) the term
Retained Insurance Contracts shall not include any contracts issued by any
Person other than the Retained Insurance Companies, as modified by clause (A)
of this proviso.       -28-  37   (iii) Except for situations which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, each Fund Client (as defined below) has
elected to qualify and, for all Taxable years that an Advisory Entity (as
defined below) served as investment adviser and with respect to which the
applicable statute of limitations (including any extensions) has not expired
("open Taxable years"), has continuously qualified to be treated as a
"regulated investment company" under Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A
of the Code and has continuously been eligible to compute, and has for each
such Taxable year computed, its federal income Tax under Section 852 of the
Code and has no earnings and profits accumulated in any Taxable year. Except
as would not be, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Fund Client that is intended to be a
Tax-exempt municipal bond fund has satisfied the requirements of Section
852(b)(5) of the Code and is qualified to pay exempt interest dividends as
defined therein. At the Closing Date, all Tax Returns with respect to any
Taxable period for which the applicable statute of limitations (including any
extensions) has not expired and during which an Advisory Entity has served as
investment adviser that were or are required to be filed on or before such
date by or on behalf of a Fund Client were or shall have been filed and were
or shall be complete and correct and all federal and other Taxes, shown or
required to be shown as due on such returns, shall have been paid or provided
for. No such Tax Return or other filing is currently under audit, no
assessment has been asserted with respect to such Tax Returns or other
filings, and no requests for waivers of the time to make any such assessment
are pending. None of the Fund Clients is delinquent in the payment of any
material Tax assessment or governmental charge.   (iv) In providing
recordkeeping and administrative services in the ordinary course of business
consistent with prior practice with respect to customers\' insurance
products, whether individual or group retirement or deferred compensation
plans or arrangements, and with respect to any Retained Insurance Contracts
issued, assumed, modified, exchanged or sold by a Retained Insurance Company
as of the Closing Date, each Retained Insurance Company is in compliance with
the applicable administrative requirements of the Code and the rules and
regulations thereunder, and, to the extent applicable, the requirements of
Parts 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA, except in each case for those failures
to comply that are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (m) Labor Matters. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures is a party to or
otherwise bound by any collective bargaining agreement, Contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures the subject of any
material proceeding asserting that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Joint Ventures has committed an unfair labor practice or seeking to compel it
to bargain with any labor union or labor organization nor is there pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company,       -29-  38  threatened, nor
has there been for the past five years, any labor strike, dispute, walk-out,
work stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving the Company or any of its

Company and its Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures who are not
Excluded Employees.   (n) Insurance. All material fire and casualty,
general liability, directors\' and officers\', errors and omissions and
product liability insurance policies maintained by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures are with reputable
insurance carriers and provide insurance coverage reasonably customary or
adequate for the operation of their respective businesses, except for any
such failures to maintain insurance policies that are not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company and its Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures have given notice to
insurance carriers of all material claims that may be covered, and, with
respect to claims in excess of $1,000,000, the Company and its Subsidiaries
and Joint Ventures have not received any refusal of coverage or any notice
that a defense will be afforded with reservation of rights or any notice of
cancellation or any other indication that any insurance policy is no longer
in full force or effect or will not be renewed or that the issuer of any
policy is not willing or able to perform its obligations thereunder.   (o)
Intellectual Property. (i) After giving effect to the Spin-Off and the
related transactions, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and Joint
Ventures will own, or will be licensed or will otherwise possess legally

Company Material Adverse Effect, and to the knowledge of the Company all
material patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks and copyrights held

subsisting.   (ii) Except as is not reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect:   (A) neither the Company nor Spinco nor
their respective Subsidiaries is, nor will any of them be as a result of the
execution and delivery of the Transaction Agreements or the performance of

ownership, validity or effectiveness of any of the Company Intellectual
Property Rights or other trade secret material to the Company; and   (C) to
the knowledge of the Company, the Company Intellectual Property does not
infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party and there is no
infringement of any of the Company Intellectual Property Rights by any third
party, including any employee or former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures.   (p) Rights Plan. (i) The board of
directors of the Company and the Company have taken all necessary action to
render the Rights Agreement inapplicable to the Merger, the Spin-Off and the
other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements.   (ii) The
Company has, or prior to the Effective Time will have, taken all necessary
action with respect to all of the outstanding Rights so that, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (A) neither the Company nor Parent
will have any obligations under the Rights or the Rights Agreement and (B)
the holders of the Rights will have no rights under the Rights or the Rights
Agreement.   (q) Brokers and Finders. Neither the Company, nor any of
its Subsidiaries, officers, directors or employees has employed any broker or
finder or incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or
finders\' fees in connection with the Merger, the Spin-Off or the other
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, except that the
Company has employed Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corporation and
Goldman, Sachs and Co. as its financial advisors. The fees and expenses of

reinsurance and healthcare products, whether individual or group, in effect

riders and ancillary agreements in connection therewith) that are issued by
the Retained Insurance Companies (the "Retained Insurance Contracts") and any
and all marketing materials, are, to the extent required under applicable
Law, on forms approved by applicable insurance regulatory authorities or
which have been filed and not objected to by such authorities within the
period provided for objection, and such forms comply in all material respects
with the Insurance Laws applicable thereto. Premium rates established by the
Retained Insurance Companies that are required to be filed with or approved
by insurance regulatory authorities have been so filed or approved, the
premiums charged conform thereto in all material respects, and such premiums
comply in all material respects with the Insurance Laws applicable thereto,
except where the failure to be so filed or approved, or to so conform or
comply, is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   (ii) To the knowledge of the Company as
of the date hereof, each insurance agent, third party administrator, manager,
marketer, underwriter, broker, reinsurance intermediary and distributor (each
an "Agent"), at the time such Agent wrote, sold, produced or managed business
for any Retained Insurance Company was duly licensed (for the type of
business written, sold, produced or managed) and no such Agent violated (or
with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would have violated) any
term or provision of any Law applicable to the writing, sale, production or
management of business for any Retained Insurance Company, except for such
failures to be licensed or such violations which have been cured, which have
been resolved or settled through agreements with applicable Governmental
Entities or which are barred by an applicable statute of limitations, or that
have not had or are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (iii) Prior to the date hereof,
the Company has made available to Parent a true and correct copy of each
material Contract between any Retained Insurance Company and any reinsurance
intermediary and of each material pooling agreement to which a Retained
Insurance Company is a party.   (iv) Prior to the date hereof, the Company
has made available to Parent a true and complete copy of any actuarial
reports prepared by independent actuaries with respect to reserve adequacy of
any Retained Insurance Company or any of its Subsidiaries since December 31,
1997, and all attachments, addenda, supplements and modifications thereto
(the "Company Actuarial Analyses"). To the knowledge of the Company, the
information and data furnished by the Company or any Retained Insurance
Company to its independent actuaries in connection with the preparation of
the Company Actuarial Analyses were accurate in all material
respects.     -32-  41   (v) To the knowledge of the Company as of the
date hereof, all material amounts recoverable under reinsurance, coinsurance
or other similar Contracts to which any Retained Insurance Company is a party
(including, but not limited to, amounts based on paid and unpaid losses) are
fully collectible.   (s) Liabilities and Reserves. (i) The reserves carried
on the Company SAP Statements or Foreign Company Statements, as the case may
be, of each Retained Insurance Company for the year ended December 31, 1999
for future annuity contracts, insurance and healthcare policy benefits,
losses, claims, reinsurance and similar purposes are in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable requirements for reserves, if any,
established by the insurance departments or applicable Governmental Entity of
the jurisdiction of domicile of such Retained Insurance Company, were
determined in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted
actuarial standards consistently applied and are fairly stated in all
material respects in accordance with sound actuarial principles utilizing
actuarial assumptions in accordance with or more conservative than called for
in relevant policy and Contract provisions. The Company has delivered to
Parent true, correct and complete copies of the actuarial valuation reports
delivered to the insurance department of the domiciliary jurisdiction of each
U.S. Retained Insurance Company for the years ended December 31, 1999 and
1998.   (ii) Except for regular periodic assessments in the ordinary course
of business consistent with prior practice or assessments based
on developments which are publicly known within the insurance industry, to
the knowledge of the Company, no claim or assessment is pending or
threatened against any U.S. Retained Insurance Company which is peculiar or
unique to such Retained Insurance Company by any state insurance guaranty
association in connection with such association\'s fund relating to insolvent
insurers which if determined adversely, is, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (t) Separate
Accounts. (i) Except as otherwise is not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each separate
account maintained by a Retained Insurance Company (collectively, the
"Company Separate Accounts") is duly and validly established and maintained
under the laws of its jurisdiction of formation and, to the extent subject to
the 1940 Act, is either excluded from the definition of an investment company
pursuant to Sections 3(c)(1), 3(c)(7) or 3(c)(11) of the 1940 Act or is duly
registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Except as otherwise
is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, each such Company Separate Account, if registered
under the 1940 Act, is operated in compliance with the 1940 Act, has filed
all reports and amendments of its registration statement required to
be filed, and has been granted all exemptive relief necessary for its
operations as presently conducted, and is in compliance with all conditions
to any such relief. Except as otherwise is not, individually    -33- 
42  or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, the Retained Insurance Contracts under which the Company
Separate Accounts assets are held are duly and validly issued and are
binding obligations of the issuing Retained Insurance Company and are either
exempt from registration under the Securities Act or were sold pursuant to
an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, and any
such registration statement is currently in effect to the extent necessary to
allow the appropriate Retained Insurance Company to receive contributions
under such Retained Insurance Contracts.   (ii) The assets of each Company
Separate Account that are subject to the Code are adequately diversified
within the meaning of, and to the extent required by, Section 817(h) of the
Code.   (iii) Each of the Retained Insurance Companies that is subject to
the Code is treated for federal Tax purposes as the owner of the
assets underlying the respective life insurance policies and annuity
contracts issued, entered into or sold by it.   (iv) Each account through
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries provides services to any client
(an "Account Client") that is (A) an employee benefit plan, as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA, that is subject to Title I of ERISA; (B) a person
acting on behalf of such a plan; or (C) an entity whose assets include the
assets of such a plan, within the meaning of ERISA and applicable regulations
(hereinafter referred to as an "ERISA Client"), in each case have been
managed by the Company and its Subsidiaries such that each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries in the exercise of such management is in compliance in all
respects with the applicable requirements of ERISA, except to the extent the
failure to comply is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (u) Material Contracts. All of
the material Contracts of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures
that are required to be described in the Company Reports or listed or filed
as Exhibits to the 1999 10-K, the First 2000 10-Q or any Company Reports
filed subsequent to the date hereof thereto are described in such Company
Reports or listed or filed as exhibits thereto, respectively, and are in full
force and effect. True and complete copies of all such material Contracts
have been delivered or made available by the Company to Parent. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures nor, to the knowledge
of the Company, any other party is in breach of or in default under any such
Contract except for such breaches and defaults as are not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures is party to
any Contract containing any provision or covenant limiting in any material
respect the ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Joint
Ventures or, assuming the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Agreements, ING or    -34-  43  any of its subsidiaries
or joint ventures, to (i) sell any products or services of or to any other
Person, (ii) engage in any line of business or (iii) compete with or to
obtain products or services from any Person or limiting the ability of any
Person to provide products or services to the Company or any of
its Affiliates or Joint Ventures or, assuming the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, ING or any of its
subsidiaries or joint ventures.   (v) Investment Contracts, Fund Clients
and Advisory Clients. (i) Certain of the Company\'s Subsidiaries provide
investment advisory, sub-advisory, administration, distribution or certain
other services (each Contract for such services being referred to as an
"Investment Contract", each other party thereto being referred to as a
"Client", and each Client which is registered as an investment company under
the 1940 Act being referred to as a "Fund Client") to the Clients. A complete
list of Fund Clients is set forth in Section 5.1(v) of the Company Disclosure
Letter. Each of the Fund Clients (or the company or trust of which it is a
series) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Boards of Trustees or Directors of the Fund Clients operate in
all material respects in conformity with the applicable requirements and
restrictions of Sections 9, 10 and 16 of the 1940 Act.   (ii) Except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, each of the Fund Clients is in compliance
with all applicable Laws of the SEC, the NASD, the IRS and any other
governmental agency or self-regulatory body having jurisdiction over such
Fund Client or its distributor or investment adviser and of any jurisdiction
in which such Fund Client is registered, qualified or sold and with its
prospectus and statement of additional information.   (iii) Each of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries that provides investment advisory or sub-advisory
services (each an "Advisory Entity" and, collectively "Advisory Entities"), a
complete list of which has previously been made available by the Company to
Parent, to any Fund Client or any other Person (each such other Person, an
"Advisory Client") is duly registered with the SEC as an investment adviser
or is not required to do so because it does not engage in business in the
United States and does not provide investment advisory or sub-advisory
services to an investment company registered under the 1940 Act. No Advisory
Entity is required to register as an investment advisor with any state. Any
Advisory Entity doing business outside the United States is duly licensed
to provide investment advisory services in the jurisdictions in which it
does business. The Company is not an Advisory Entity. Each pooled Advisory
Client is either registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act or
relies upon an appropriate exemption from the definition of an investment
company under the 1940 Act.    -35-  44  (iv) Each Fund Client and
Advisory Entity has operated and is currently operating in compliance with
all Laws, and with the investment objectives, policies and restrictions, that
are applicable to it or its business except for such noncompliance as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each Advisory Entity has been and is in compliance
with each Investment Contract to which it is a party, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   (v) The accounts of each Advisory Client subject
to ERISA have been managed by the applicable Company Subsidiary in compliance
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of ERISA.   (vi)
All issued and outstanding shares of common stock and shares or units of
beneficial interest of each Fund Client (collectively, "shares") are, and at
the Effective Time will be, and all of the authorized but unissued shares of
each Fund Client when issued for the consideration described in the current
registration statement relating to that Fund Client will be duly and legally
issued and outstanding, fully paid, and non-assessable by the Fund Client. No
Fund Client has outstanding any options, warrants, or other rights
to subscribe for or purchase any of its shares, nor is there outstanding
any security convertible into shares of any Fund Client.   (vii) The
current prospectus and related registration statement, including the current
statement of additional information, for each of the Fund Clients (copies of
which have been made available to Parent) conform in all material respects to
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the 1940 Act, and the
rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, as well as the applicable
requirements of the various state securities Laws, and do not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  
(viii) Each Fund Client has filed with the SEC all material Contracts,
including all agreements and arrangements for the distribution of shares, to
which a Fund Client is a party or by which a Fund Client or its property is
bound, other than Contracts for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities
entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with
prior practice, that are required to be filed with the SEC. Each Contract
subject to Section 12(b) or 15 of the 1940 Act has been duly approved at all
times in compliance in all material respects with Section 12(b) or 15 of the
1940 Act and all other applicable Laws. Each such Contract is currently in
full force and effect and has been performed by the relevant entity in
accordance with the 1940 Act and all other applicable Laws. No material
default or condition or event that, after notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a material default on the part of the Company or any of
its    -36-  45 Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Company, on the
part of the other parties to such advisory and sub-advisory agreements,
exists under any of those material Contracts.   (ix) All proxy statements
to be prepared for use by the Fund Clients in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements will, with respect to
information provided by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or a Fund
Client, not contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state
any material fact required to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.   (w) Company
Broker/Dealers. (i) The Company and its Subsidiaries operate its
broker/dealer operations exclusively through Aetna Life Insurance and Annuity
Company, Aeltus Capital, Inc., Aetna Investment Services, Inc., Systematized
Benefits Administrators, Inc., Financial Network Investment Corporation and
Aetna Financial Services, Inc. (collectively, the "Company Broker/Dealers").
Each Company Broker/Dealer that is required to be registered as a broker-
dealer with the SEC or under applicable state Laws is so registered and is
registered with each other Governmental Entity with which it is required to
register in order to conduct its business as now conducted, and is and
has been since January 1, 1997 in full compliance with all applicable
Laws thereunder, except for any failures to register or comply which are
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Broker/Dealer is a member organization
in good standing of the NASD and such other organizations in which its
membership is required in order to conduct its business as now conducted,
except such failures to be in good standing or such memberships the failure
to have or maintain which are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (ii) Except
as are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, no Company Broker/Dealer is, nor is any
"associated person" of it, subject to a "statutory disqualification" (as such
terms are defined in the Exchange Act) or subject to a disqualification that
would be a basis for censure, limitations on the activities, functions or
operations of, or suspension or revocation of the registration of any of the
Company Broker/Dealers as broker-dealer, municipal securities dealer,
government securities broker or government securities dealer under Section
15, Section 15B or Section 15C of the Exchange Act and, to the knowledge of
the Company, there are no proceedings or investigations pending by any
Governmental Entity or self-regulatory organization that is reasonably likely
to result in any such censure, limitations, suspension or revocation.  
(iii) Except as are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, since its inception, each Company
Broker/Dealer has had net capital (as such term is defined in Rule 15c3-1
under the    -37-  46 Exchange Act) that satisfies the minimum net
capital requirements of the Exchange Act and of the laws of any jurisdiction
in which such company conducts business.   (x) Bank Regulatory Matters. (i)
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures or their
respective properties is a party to or is subject to any order, decree,
agreement, memorandum of understanding or similar agreement with, or
extraordinary supervisory letter from, any Banking Authority.   (ii)
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures has been
advised by any Banking Authority that such Banking Authority is contemplating
issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of issuing or
requesting) any such order, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding,
supervisory letter or similar submission.   (y) No Contracts, Etc. Except
for assets or properties to be transferred to Spinco or its Subsidiaries
pursuant to the Transaction Agreements, none of Spinco or any of its
Subsidiaries presently uses in the conduct of its business any material
assets or properties, whether tangible, intangible or mixed, which are also
utilized in the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and Joint Ventures, and, other than ordinary course commercial arrangements
on arms length terms, none of Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries is presently
directly or indirectly a party to any Contract, arrangement or understanding
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures (other than the
Transaction Agreements). After giving effect to the Spin-Off and to all
supplies and services to be provided pursuant to the Transaction Agreements,
the Company and its Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures, will include all the
Company\'s direct or indirect right, title and interest (including minority
interests) in and to all of (i) the assets and services that are necessary to
permit the operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures
in substantially the same manner as such operations have been conducted prior
to the date hereof and (ii) all assets reflected on the unaudited pro forma
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of March
31, 2000 referred to in Section 5.1(e)(iv) of this Agreement, except those
assets disposed of in the ordinary course of business since such date. The
termination of all Contracts, arrangements and understandings between the
Company and its Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures on the one hand and Spinco
and its Subsidiaries on the other hand, to the extent contemplated by the
Distribution Agreement, is not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The unaudited pro forma
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of March
31, 2000 referred to in Section 5.1(e)(v) of this Agreement reflects all
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures principally
used in the business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
Joint Ventures as of March 31, 2000, other than assets or properties of the
Company or Aetna Services, Inc. or any of their Subsidiaries that will be
transferred to    -38-  47 Spinco or its Subsidiaries and made available
as necessary to provide services to the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant
to the Transaction Agreements.   5.2 Representations and Warranties of ING,
Parent and Merger Sub. Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or
subsections of the disclosure letter, dated the date hereof, delivered to the
Company by Parent on or prior to entering into this Agreement (the "Parent
Disclosure Letter"), ING, Parent and Merger Sub each hereby represent and
warrant to the Company that:   (a) Capitalization of Merger Sub. The
authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub
is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent, and there are (i) no
other shares of capital stock or voting securities of Merger Sub, (ii) no
securities of Merger Sub convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
capital stock or voting securities of Merger Sub and (iii) no options or
other rights to acquire from Merger Sub, and no obligations of Merger Sub to
issue, any capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for capital stock or voting securities of Merger Sub. Merger Sub
has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has no, and prior
to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any
nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to the
Transaction Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereunder.   (b)
Organization, Good Standing and Qualification. Each of ING, Parent and Merger
Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and
is qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
where the ownership or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of
its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
organized, qualified or in such good standing, or to have such power

more countries, (iii) adverse economic, currency or regulatory changes or
effects in or affecting the financial services industry, insurance industry,

ING, Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by ING, Parent and Merger Sub
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except those

reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (ii) The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by ING, Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by ING, Parent and Merger Sub of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or
result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the governing

any party under any of the Contracts, except, in the case of clause (B) or

set forth on Section 5.2(d)(iii) of the Parent Disclosure Letter.   (e)

(a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor
Spinco nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of
any of them shall, and that it shall direct and use its best efforts to cause
Spinco\'s, its and their Subsidiaries\' employees, agents and representatives
(including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by them or
any of their Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit
or encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with
respect to a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar
transaction, or any purchase of all or 10% or more of the assets or any
equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Spinco or any
of its Subsidiaries (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to
as an "Acquisition Proposal"), it being understood that any such activities
engaged in prior to the date of this Agreement do not violate this Section
6.2. The Company further agrees that from and after the date hereof neither
it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor Spinco nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any
of the officers and directors of any of them shall, and that it shall direct
and use its best efforts to cause Spinco\'s, its and their
Subsidiaries\' employees, agents and representatives (including any
investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by them or any of their
Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, engage in any negotiations
concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any
discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or
otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however,    -45-  54  that nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its board of
directors from (A) complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; (B)
providing information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has
made a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in
violation of this Section 6.2(a) if the board of directors receives from the
Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement
on terms substantially similar to those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (as defined below); (C) engaging in any negotiations or discussions
with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that was not solicited in violation of this Section 6.2(a); or (D)
recommending such an Acquisition Proposal to the shareholders of the Company,
if and only to the extent that, (i) in each such case referred to in clause
(B), (C) or (D) above, the board of directors of the Company determines in
good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that such action is
necessary in order for its directors to comply with their respective
fiduciary duties under applicable law and (ii) in each case referred to in
clause (C) or (D) above, the board of directors of the Company determines in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor) that such
Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated,
taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the
proposal and the Person making the proposal and would, if consummated, result
in a transaction or a combination of transactions more favorable to
the Company\'s shareholders from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any such more favorable
Acquisition Proposal being referred to in this Agreement as a "Superior
Proposal"). The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the
individuals or entities referred to in the first sentence hereof of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 6.2. The Company agrees that it will
notify Parent immediately if any such inquiries, proposals or offers relating
to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such information is requested
from, or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, any of its representatives indicating, in connection with
such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of
any proposals or offers and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a
current basis, on the status and terms of any such proposals or offers and
the status of any such discussions or negotiations. The Company also agrees
that it will promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring
it or any of its Subsidiaries or Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries to return
or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person
by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries or Spinco or any of its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the provisions of this Section 6.2(a) shall not restrict in
any respect the right of the Company, Spinco, Spinco\'s Subsidiaries or any
of the officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives of any of
them to, directly or    -46-  55  indirectly, initiate, solicit,
encourage or take any other action with respect to (including without
limitation entering into an agreement for) any transaction relating to any
assets or equity securities of Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries, so long as
such transaction would not reasonably be expected to interfere with the
timely consummation of the Merger, the Spin-Off or the other transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements.   (b) Notwithstanding anything
in this Section 6.2 to the contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Requisite Vote, the Company\'s board of directors determines in good
faith, on the basis of the advice of its financial advisors and outside
counsel, in response to an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
breach of Section 6.2(a), that such proposal is a Superior Proposal, the
Company or its board of directors may terminate this Agreement if, and only
if, the Company shall substantially concurrently with such termination enter
into a definitive agreement containing the terms of a Superior Proposal;
provided, however, that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this sentence, and any purported termination pursuant to this
sentence shall be void and of no force or effect, unless the Company shall
have complied with (i) all the provisions of this Section 6.2, including the
notification provisions in this Section 6.2, (ii) the following proviso, and
(iii) all applicable requirements of Section 8.3, including the payment of
the termination fee described in Section 8.5(b) prior to or concurrently with
such termination; and provided further, however, that the Company shall not
exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.2
until after five business days following Parent\'s receipt of written notice
(a "Notice of Superior Proposal") advising Parent that the Company\'s board
of directors has received such a Superior Proposal and that such board of
directors will, subject to any action taken by Parent pursuant to
this sentence, cause the Company to accept such Superior Proposal, specifying
the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying
the Person making such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that
any amendment to the price or any other material term of such a Superior
Proposal shall require an additional Notice of Superior Proposal and a new
five business day period).   6.3 Accuracy of Proxy Statement and Form 10.
Each of the Company, ING and Parent agrees that none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by it or its Affiliates, Subsidiaries or Joint
Ventures (and in the case of the Company, including Spinco and its
Affiliates) for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the proxy
statement of the Company seeking approval of the Merger (the "Proxy
Statement") and the registration statement on Form 10 relating to the Spin-
Off (the "Form 10") and any amendment or supplement thereto will, in the case
of the Proxy Statement, at the date of mailing to holders of Shares and at
the time of the meeting of holders of Shares of the Company to be held in
connection with the Transaction and, in the case of the Form 10, at the
effective date of the Form 10 and at the date of mailing of the Form 10 to
holders of record of the Shares, in any such case, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make    -47- 
56  the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement and
the Form 10 and any amendment or supplement thereto will comply in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder.   6.4 Shareholders Meeting. The Company
will take, in accordance with applicable law and its certificate of
incorporation and by-laws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of
holders of shares of Common Stock (the "Shareholders Meeting") as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement to consider and
vote upon the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Subject to fiduciary obligations and the requirements of applicable
Law, the Company\'s board of directors shall recommend such approval and
shall take all lawful action to solicit such approval.   6.5 Filings; Other
Actions; Notification. (a) ING, Parent and the Company shall use their
respective best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement
and the Form 10 as promptly as is practicable after the date hereof. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) have the Proxy Statement
and the Form 10 approved by the SEC as promptly as practicable after each
such filing and (ii) promptly after each such approval thereafter mail the
Proxy Statement and the Form 10 to the holders of Shares of the Company. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent and ING of any request by the SEC for
any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Form 10 and shall
provide Parent and ING copies of all correspondence between the
Company and/or any of its representatives and the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement.   (b) The Company, ING and Parent shall cooperate with
each other and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries, Joint
Ventures and joint ventures, including Spinco and its Subsidiaries, to use)

on its part under the Transaction Agreements and applicable Laws to

transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements as soon as

Approvals") and/or any third party and make all transfers or assignments
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, in each case in order to
consummate the Merger, the Spin-Off or any of the other transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, in each case on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Transaction Agreements; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 6.5 shall require,     -48- 
57  or be construed to require, ING or Parent, in connection with the
receipt of any regulatory approval, to proffer to, or agree to (i) sell or
hold separate and agree to sell, divest or to discontinue to or limit, before
or after the Effective Time, any assets, businesses, or interest in any
assets or businesses of ING, Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates or Joint Ventures (or to consent to any sale, or agreement to
sell, or discontinuance or limitation by ING or Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, of any of its assets or businesses) or (ii) agree to any
conditions relating to, or changes or restriction in, the operations of any
such asset or businesses which, in the case of clause (i) or clause (ii), is
reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition, properties, business or annual
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or a material adverse effect on the financial condition, properties, business
or annual results of operations of ING and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information
(including any obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of
any securities exchange), each of ING, Parent and the Company shall have the
right to review and approve (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the
other on, all the information relating to it, and any of its Affiliates and
Joint Ventures, that appear in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any
securities exchange) in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements.   (c) The Company, ING and
Parent each shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all true
and accurate information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures
and joint ventures (including in the case of the Company, Spinco and its
Subsidiaries), directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy
Statement or the Form 10 or any other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of ING, Parent or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures or joint ventures to any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements.   (d) The
Company, ING and Parent each shall promptly provide the other party with
copies of all filings made by either the Company, Spinco, ING or Parent with
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transaction Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Company, ING and Parent
each shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including
promptly furnishing the other with copies of any notices or
other communications received by Spinco, ING, Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures or joint ventures,
from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements.
Notwithstanding    -49-  58  the foregoing, Spinco shall only be
required with respect to the Spin-Off to provide ING and Parent copies of
material filings, notices and communications relating to the Spin-Off. The
Company shall keep Parent informed on a prompt basis concerning the status of
rating agency communications regarding Spinco and provide Parent with copies
of all presentations to and correspondence with rating agencies relating to
the Spinco rating. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
change that is reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (e) In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation or other
proceeding by any Governmental Entity or other Person or other legal
or administrative proceeding is commenced that questions the validity or
legality of any of the Transaction Agreements, the Merger, the Spin-Off or
the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements or claims
damages in connection therewith, the Company, ING and Parent each agree to
cooperate and use their best reasonable efforts to defend against and respond
thereto.   (f) The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to
assist Parent in obtaining all required consents, including the consent of
the People\'s Republic of China, prior to the Effective Time, to either (i)
the transfer of the joint venture interest held by Aetna Life Insurance
Company in Pacific-Aetna Life Insurance Company Limited to a Subsidiary of
the Company or (ii) if consent to such transfer cannot be obtained on terms
and conditions reasonably acceptable to Parent on an alternative structure
agreed upon with Parent whereby the benefits (as well as the liabilities)
associated with the joint venture interest held by Aetna Life Insurance
Company in Pacific-Aetna Life Insurance Company Limited are transferred to a
Subsidiary of the Company; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
require the Company, its Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures or joint ventures to
(x) take or fail to take any action that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect in any respect any of Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries or
prevent or materially delay or impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or (y) pay any money, other than reasonable advisors\'
fees and expenses, to any third party in connection with carrying out its
obligations under this sentence. Notwithstanding the references to
Governmental Consents of the Peoples Republic of China and Hong Kong in
Section 7.1(b) of this Agreement, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the transfer of the joint venture interest held by Aetna Life Insurance
Company in Pacific-Aetna Life Insurance Company Limited or the license held
by Pacific-Aetna Life Insurance Company Limited are not to be a condition to
either party\'s obligation to effect the Merger.   (g) The Company shall use
its best efforts to satisfy the conditions to the Spin-Off set forth in
Section 3.02 of the Distribution Agreement and shall effect the Spin-Off if
such conditions have been satisfied. Notwithstanding anything in this Section
6.5 to the contrary, the parties acknowledge and agree that this Section 6.5
shall not     -50-  59  require the Company or Spinco, in connection
with the receipt of any Governmental Approval in connection with the
consummation of the Spin-Off, to proffer or agree to conditions relating to,
or changes or restrictions in, the operations or assets of Spinco and its
Subsidiaries that are reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to
have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, properties,
business or annual results of operations of Spinco and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or waive any condition to the Spin-Off set forth in Section
3.02 of the Distribution Agreement. At or prior to the Spin-Off, the Company
shall take those actions required by Section 7.01 of the Distribution
Agreement to be taken at or prior to the Spin-Off.   (h) The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to keep Parent informed
concerning material developments, including with respect to matters addressed
in Section 6.1 of this Agreement, in the businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and to consult periodically with representatives of Parent
concerning such developments.   6.6 Access. Upon reasonable notice, and
subject to applicable law, the Company shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures to and use reasonable efforts to cause its
Fund Clients to) afford Parent\'s officers, employees, counsel, accountants
and other authorized representatives ("Representatives") reasonable access,
during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective
Time, to its officers, employees, properties, books, Contracts and records
and, during such period, shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Joint
Ventures and Spinco and its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other
all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may
reasonably be requested; provided, however, that no investigation pursuant to
this Section shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by the Company; and provided further, however, that the
foregoing shall not require the Company to permit any inspection, or
to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company
would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or
violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company
shall have used best reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third
party to such inspection or disclosure. All requests for information made
pursuant to this Section shall be directed to an executive officer of the
Company or such Person as may be designated by its officers, as the case may
be.   6.7 Stock Exchange. The Surviving Corporation shall use its best
efforts to cause the Shares to be de-listed from the New York Stock Exchange
(the "NYSE") and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time.   6.8 Publicity. The initial press release
with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be a joint press release.     -51-  60  Thereafter,
neither the Company, Spinco, ING nor Parent shall (i) issue any press release
or otherwise make any public announcements with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than the Spin-Off)
or (ii) make any material filings with any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity (including any securities exchange) for the purpose
of furthering consummation of the Transactions, in each case without
consulting with, and obtaining the prior consent of, the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Company shall use
its best reasonable efforts to consult in advance with Parent concerning any
public announcement concerning the Spin-Off. Notwithstanding the foregoing
two sentences, a party may, without consulting with or obtaining the consent
of the other party, issue a press release or otherwise make a public
announcement as may be required by Law or under the applicable rules of any
securities exchange if it has used its best reasonable efforts to consult
with the other party and to obtain such party\'s consent but has been unable
to do so in a timely manner.   6.9 Benefits; Company Options; Company
Employees.   (a) Exhibit A (the "Employee Benefits Agreement") to
the Distribution Agreement, which sets forth the covenants of the Company
relating to employee benefits matters, shall have the same force and effect,
and shall be subject to the provisions hereof until the Effective Time, as if
set forth herein.   (b) The Company and Spinco agree to, and to cause each
of their Subsidiaries to, (x) consult with Parent in advance of (and in a
manner which provides Parent reasonable time to comment) issuing or making
any communications to the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
regarding the Transaction or any other employee benefit matter and (y)
develop with Parent a communications program relating to the post Spin-Off
period, which shall be implemented prior to the Spin-Off (it being understood
such implementation will be made in a timely manner so as to effectuate
enrollment in the new benefit plans the Company will offer after the Spin-
Off).   (c) Except as expressly contemplated by the Employee
Benefits Agreement, the Company agrees not to and to cause its Subsidiaries
not to (x) transfer employees from any of Aetna Retirement Services, Inc. or
Aetna International, Inc. or any of their Subsidiaries (that are also
Subsidiaries of the Company) or Joint Ventures to the Company, Aetna
Services, Inc., Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures without
Parent\'s consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) or (y)
transfer employees to Aetna Retirement Services, Inc. or Aetna International,
Inc. or any of their Subsidiaries (that are also Subsidiaries of the Company)
or Joint Ventures from the Company, Aetna Services, Inc., Spinco or any of
its Subsidiaries without Parent\'s consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld).     -52-  61   (d) The Company, Spinco and
Parent agree to cooperate in the preparation of, and mutually agree with
Parent on the final versions of the schedules to the Employee Benefits
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in this regard
the Company and Spinco agree to provide to Parent all relevant information
available to them in respect of the Company and its Subsidiaries\' employees
and the Compensation and Benefit Plans for the purposes of creating such
schedules.   6.10 ERISA Client Lists. Within 30 days following the
date hereof, Parent shall deliver to the Company a written list of the
entities that are affiliated with or related to Parent (the "Parent ERISA
List"). As soon as practicable after the date the Parent ERISA List is
delivered to the Company, but in no event later than 30 days before the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a written statement which
identifies each Account Client that is an ERISA Client and lists each
contract or agreement, if any, and all amendments thereto, in effect on the
date hereof, entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to or on behalf of any such ERISA Client, pursuant to which any of
the entities identified in the Parent ERISA List has agreed to (i) execute
securities transactions, (ii) provide any other goods or services or (iii)
purchase, sell, exchange or swap securities or any other economic interests
therein or derivative thereof, including but not limited to rights to receive
or obligations to pay interest or principal denominated in a particular
currency.   6.11 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in Section
8.5(b), Section 9.10 or any Transaction Agreement, whether or not the Merger
is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
Transaction Agreements and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Agreements shall be paid by the party incurring such
expense, except that (a) expenses incurred in connection with the filing fee
and printing and mailing the Proxy Statement shall be shared equally by
Parent and the Company and (b) all Transaction Expenses (as defined below),
unless otherwise specifically provided for in any Transaction Agreement,
shall be paid by Spinco. "Transaction Expenses" shall mean all fees, costs
and expenses incurred by (i) the Company, its Subsidiaries and Joint
Ventures, in each case at or prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) Spinco and
its Subsidiaries, in the case of each of clause (i) and (ii), in connection
with the Merger, the Spin-Off or any of the other transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Agreements, including the fees and expenses of the
Company\'s and Spinco\'s legal and financial advisors and the other fees and
expenses set forth on Section 6.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter.   6.12
Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance. (a) From and after the
Effective Time, ING agrees that it will cause the Company to indemnify and
hold harmless each present and former director, officer and employee of the
Company (when acting in such capacity), determined as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys\' fees),    -53-  62  judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, "Costs") incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that
the Company would have been permitted or required under Connecticut law and
its certificate of incorporation or by-laws or pursuant to other agreements
in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such Person (and ING shall also
cause the Company to advance expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law; provided, however, that the Person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification); and provided further, however, that any determination
required to be made with respect to whether an officer\'s or director\'s
conduct complies with the standards set forth under Connecticut law and the
Company\'s certificate of incorporation and by-laws shall be made by
independent counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation.   (b) Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of
this Section 6.12, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, shall promptly notify the Surviving Corporation and ING
thereof. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) ING
or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and ING or the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to
such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any
other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if ING or the Surviving
Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified
Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest
between ING or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and ING or the
Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are
received; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation or ING shall be
obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of counsel
for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction, (ii) the Indemnified Parties
will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) ING or the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent; and provided further that neither ING nor the
Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified
Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately
determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated
hereby is prohibited by applicable law.   (c) ING shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to either (i) maintain the Company\'s existing officers\' and
directors\' liability insurance for a period of six years     -54- 
63  after the Effective Time or (ii) maintain a run-off or tail policy
or endorsement with respect to covering claims asserted within six years
after the Effective Time arising from facts or events that occurred at or
before the Effective Time (either, "DandO; Insurance"), in each case so long as
the annual premium therefor is not in excess of 175% of the last annual
premium paid prior to the date hereof (the "Current Premium"); provided,
however, that if the existing DandO; Insurance expires, is terminated or
cancelled during such six-year period, the Surviving Corporation will use its
reasonable efforts to obtain as much DandO; Insurance as can be obtained for
the remainder of such period for a premium not in excess (on an annualized
basis) of 175% of the Current Premium.   (d) If the Surviving Corporation or
any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any
other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section.   (e) The
provisions of this Section are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their
representatives.   (f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 6.12 to
the contrary, to the extent a Cost is also a Spinco Group Liability (as
defined in the Distribution Agreement) such matter shall be addressed as a
Spinco Group Liability pursuant to the Distribution Agreement rather than
this Section 6.12.   6.13 Compliance with 1940 Act Section 15. (a) Prior to
the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure
compliance with Section 15(f) of the 1940 Act, so that the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements will be in compliance immediately
after the Closing with Section 15(f) of the 1940 Act, including assuring that
at the time of the Closing at least 75% of the Board of Directors or Trustees
of each Fund Client are not "interested persons" (as such term is defined in
the 1940 Act) of the Surviving Corporation or the Company.   (b) Parent
will use reasonable best efforts to assure compliance with the conditions of
Section 15(f) of the 1940 Act as it applies to the transactions contemplated
by the Agreement. From and after the Closing, Parent shall conduct the
business of the Surviving Corporation so as to assure that, insofar as within
the control of Parent: (i) for a period of three (3) years after the Closing
Date, at least 75% of the members of the Board of Directors or Trustees of
each Fund Client which enters into a replacement Investment Contract with an
Advisory Entity that constitutes an investment advisory    -55- 
64  agreement are not (A) "interested persons" of the Surviving Corporation
or (B) "interested persons" of the Company; and (ii) there is not imposed on
any Fund Client an "unfair burden" (within the meaning of Section 15(f) of
the 1940 Act) as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements, or any express or implied terms, conditions or understandings
applicable thereto.   (c) For a period of three years (3) after the Closing,
none of Parent, Surviving Corporation, nor any of their respective Affiliates
will voluntarily engage in any transaction which would constitute an
assignment of any investment advisory contract with any Fund Client that is
registered under the 1940 Act and is currently managed by the Company or its
Affiliates to which Parent, Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates or the Company or any of its Affiliates is a party without first
obtaining a covenant in all material respects the same as that contained in
this Section 6.13.   6.14 Fund Client Contracts, Distribution Plans and
Boards. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause (a) the
consideration and due approval by the Board of Directors of each Fund Client
and (b) to the extent required by the 1940 Act, the consideration and due
approval by such Fund Client\'s securityholders, of (X) a new Investment
Contract (or, where permitted, approval of continuation of the existing
Investment Contract) with the same Advisory Entity to become effective upon
the Closing, in each case, on the same material terms as in effect on the
date hereof under such Investment Contract for the performance by the
relevant Advisory Entity of investment management, investment advisory,
investment subadvisory or distribution services and (Y) an amended Rule 12b-1
distribution plan, in each case, on the same material terms as in effect on
the date hereof. In addition, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to encourage the Board of Directors of each Fund Client (or, to the
extent required by the 1940 Act, the independent Directors thereof) (X) to
select and nominate, so as to constitute a majority of the
independent Directors of such Board, individuals who are currently serving as
independent directors of investment companies that are advised by an
Affiliate of Parent and (Y) to nominate one director (who shall not be an
independent director) that is selected by Parent in each case so long as the
Company does not reasonably conclude, after consultation with Parent, such
encouragement would adversely affect the ability of the Company to obtain any
consent required pursuant to Section 7.2(d).   6.15 Non-Fund Advisory
Contracts. The Company or relevant Advisory Entity shall notify each Advisory
Client of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements and use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to the Closing, any necessary
consent of each Advisory Client to the "assignment" (as such term is used in
the Advisers Act) of its Investment Contract involving investment advisory
services as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements in a form    -56-   65  reasonably satisfactory to Parent.
The Company and Advisory Entity shall consult with Parent regarding all
written communications with Advisory Clients concerning the obtaining of such
assignments.   6.16 Qualification of the Fund Clients; Fund Client
Boards. Subject to applicable fiduciary duties to the Fund Clients, the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Fund Clients to
take no action (i) that would prevent any Fund Client from qualifying as a
"regulated investment company" under Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A
of the Code, (ii) that would prevent any Fund Client that is intended to be a
Tax-exempt municipal bond fund from satisfying the requirements of Section
852(b)(5) of the Code or from qualifying to pay exempt interest dividends as
defined therein or (iii) that would be inconsistent with any Fund Client\'s
prospectus and other offering, advertising and marketing materials.   6.17
Rights. Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company
shall take all necessary action to amend the definition of Final Expiration
Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement) to be the Distribution Time (as
defined in the Distribution Agreement).   6.18 Takeover Statute. If any
Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, ING, Parent and
their respective boards of directors and the Company and its board of
directors shall each grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by the Transaction Agreements and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute
or regulation on such transactions.   6.19 Company Debt. Effective as of
the Closing and, in each case (to the extent necessary), pursuant to
supplemental indentures (reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the
Company), ING shall guarantee the performance of the obligations of Aetna
Services, Inc. and the Company with respect to the Long-Term Debt, each such
guarantee to take substantially the same form as the Company\'s current
guarantees of the obligations of Aetna Services, Inc. under the Long-Term
Debt.   6.20 Voting of Shares. Each of ING and Parent agrees to vote, or
cause to be voted, all Shares beneficially owned by it or any of
its Affiliates in favor of adoption of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby at the Shareholders Meeting.   6.21 Other
Agreements. (a) The Company agrees that it shall use its reasonable best
efforts promptly to enter into agreements for the sale of those Persons set
forth on Section 6.21 of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Section 6.21
Subsidiaries") on terms and conditions as favorable to the Company and its
Subsidiaries as can be   -57-  66 obtained and in accordance with the
procedures agreed between the parties. The Company shall permit
representatives of Parent to be fully involved in every aspect of such sales
process and the Company shall retain such financial and legal advisors to
effect such sales as Parent shall reasonably request. Except as may otherwise
be agreed, the terms and conditions of all agreements for sale or other
agreements in connection with the sales process shall be subject to Parent\'s
prior approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required in connection
with effecting these sales to take any action that would adversely affect
Spinco and its Subsidiaries. Transaction expenses incurred in connection with
such sales shall not be deemed to be "Transaction Expenses" for purposes of
this Agreement and shall not be required to be paid by Spinco pursuant to
Section 7.03 of the Distribution Agreement. Parent and the Company each agree
that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain waivers of regulatory
requirements in the jurisdictions of the Section 6.21 Subsidiaries that
otherwise could delay or prevent satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1(b).   (b) The Company agrees that in carrying out the
transactions contemplated by the Distribution Agreement it shall use its
reasonable best efforts (consistent with and subject to the terms and
conditions of the Transaction Agreements) to minimize the creation of
liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company shall keep
Parent informed on a regular basis concerning the developments in the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements and the means by
which such transactions are effected and, subject to any existing agreements
as to the means of effecting the transactions that are reflected in the
Distribution Agreement, the Company shall give reasonable consideration to
Parent\'s views on the means by which such transactions are effected.   (c)
In connection with the Spin-Off, the Company and Spinco shall enter into a
trademark licensing agreement (the "Chinese Mark Agreement") pursuant to
which the Company shall grant to Spinco a perpetual, exclusive, and royalty-
free license to use the Chinese name and/or characters associated with the
name "Aetna" or related logo, identified on Schedules D or I of
the Distribution Agreement (including, to the extent held by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries, all forms
and transliterations thereof, the "Chinese Mark") in connection with the
Spinco Business (as that term is defined in the Distribution Agreement) in
the United States. The Company acknowledges that the rights, title to and
interest in the Chinese Mark and the associated Intellectual Property Rights
(as defined in the Distribution Agreement) (the "Aetna China Name Rights")
shall be owned by a member of the Aetna Group following the Spin-Off. The
Chinese Mark Agreement shall contain such other terms and conditions as the
parties may agree, which terms and conditions shall be no less favorable to
Spinco than the terms and conditions of the Trademark Licensing Agreement are
to the Company (taking into account those issues which may arise by virtue of
the fact that the Chinese   -58-  67 Mark is a translation of an
Intellectual Property Right which will, following the Spin-Off, be owned by
Spinco).   (d) On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or its Affiliates
shall use its reasonable best efforts to procure insurance coverage having
the terms and conditions set forth in Section 6.21 of the Parent Disclosure
Letter or insurance policies procured by Parent or its Affiliates to cover
similar risks (the "Coverage Policies"). The Company agrees that,
in connection with any such Coverage Policies, the Company shall contribute
or cause to be contributed as a capital contribution to Aetna Retirement
Services, Inc., cash in an amount equal to Parent\'s actual cost of obtaining
such Coverage Policies, or a portion of such cost not to exceed $30 million,
or in the event Parent notifies the Company that such Coverage Policies
are unavailable on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, $30 million,
and the amount of any such contribution shall not increase the Net
Capital Contribution Amount.   (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall contribute, or cause to be contributed, to the capital of Aetna
Retirement Services, Inc. an amount equal to $3.97 million.   6.22
Headquarters and Related Matters. Parent agrees to cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain the principal corporate offices of the Company\'s
qualified plan operations in the city of Hartford, in the State
of Connecticut for at least three (3) years following the Effective Time and
Parent intends to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to maintain
employment levels in and around the city of Hartford at substantially current
levels, less normal attrition.   6.23 Asia. Parent agrees that for one year
from the Effective Time, unless there is a material change in circumstances
at ING and its Subsidiaries, Parent shall not permit the Company and its
Subsidiaries to sell the interests of Aetna International, Inc. in Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Malaysia; provided that the foregoing shall not limit the right
of Parent to sell minority interests in such Subsidiaries.  6.24
Confidentiality. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below) shall apply with respect
to all information provided hereunder to Parent or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives (as such term is defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement).    ARTICLE VII   Conditions     -59-

or Joint Ventures with, and all consents, registrations, approvals, permits
and authorizations required to be obtained prior to the Effective Time by
Spinco, the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Joint Ventures from, any Governmental Entity in connection with the execution
and delivery of the Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by Spinco, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall have been made or obtained (as the case
may be), other than (in the case of jurisdictions other than the United
States, the Netherlands, the People\'s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Mexico,
Poland, Malaysia and Taiwan) those the failure of which to make or obtain are
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely (as compared to the
situation in which they are made or obtained and taking into account all
possible consequences to Parent and its Subsidiaries, Spinco and its
Subsidiaries and the Company and its Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures of
consummating the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements
without making or obtaining them) (A) to be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures, taken as a whole, (B) to be material to
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (C) to materially and
adversely impact the reasonably anticipated economic and business benefits to
Parent and its Subsidiaries of the transactions contemplated hereby, (D)
to result in criminal liability or a more than de minimis civil fine or
other penalty against Parent or any of its Affiliates, joint ventures or
employees or against the Company or any of its Affiliates, Joint Ventures or
employees or (E) to result in Parent and its Subsidiaries and joint ventures
being prohibited from conducting, or materially limited in their ability to
conduct, business in any jurisdiction (collectively, "Governmental
Consents").     -60-  69  (c) Litigation. (i) No court or Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any Law (including any Insurance Law) (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) (collectively, an "Order") that is in effect and
restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits consummation of the Spin-Off or the
Merger.   (ii) No Governmental Entity shall have instituted or threatened
to institute any proceeding that seeks such an Order.   (d) Spin-Off. The
Spin-Off shall have been consummated in accordance with the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in Section 3.02 of the Distribution
Agreement.   7.2 Conditions to Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub.
The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger are also
subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Parent at or prior to the Effective
Time of the following conditions:   (a) Representations and Warranties. (i)
The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement
which are qualified by "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall each be true
and correct as so qualified as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the
extent any such representation or warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier
date), (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Sections 5.1(a)(i) or (ii), 5.1(b), 5.1(c), 5.1(j), 5.1(p) and 5.1(q) of this
Agreement which are not qualified by "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall
each be true and correct in all material respects as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing
Date (except to the extent any such representation or warranty expressly
speaks as of an earlier date) and (iii) the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in this Agreement other than those contemplated by
clauses (i) and (ii) hereof (without giving effect to any qualifications as
to "materiality" or other similar qualifications) shall be true and correct
as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on
and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent any such representation or
warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date), except where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be true and correct (without giving
effect to any qualifications as to "materiality" or other similar
qualifications) would not be, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Parent shall have received
a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by an executive officer of the
Company to the foregoing effect.   (b) Performance of Obligations of the
Company. Each of Spinco and the Company shall have performed in all material
respects all obligations required to be    -61-  70 performed by it
under the Transaction Agreements at or prior to the Closing Date, and Parent
shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by an
executive officer of the Company to such effect.   (c) Consents Under
Agreements. The Company shall have obtained the consent or approval of each
Person whose consent or approval shall be required in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements under any Contract to
which Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures or joint ventures is a party and conduct the
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures and joint
ventures substantially as presently conducted, except those for which the
failure to obtain such consent or approval is not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or is
not reasonably likely to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
ability of Spinco or the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Agreements and no such consent or approval, and, except as
otherwise agreed in writing pursuant to this Agreement, no Governmental
Consent shall require ING to (i) sell or hold separate and agree to sell,
divest or to discontinue to or limit, before or after the Effective Time, any
assets, businesses, or interest in any assets or businesses of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates, Joint Ventures or joint
ventures (or to consent to any sale, or agreement to sell, or discontinuance
or limitation by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, of any of its
assets or businesses) or (ii) agree to any conditions relating to, or changes
or restriction in, the operations of any such asset or businesses which, in
either the case of clause (i) or (ii), is reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, properties, business or
annual results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, Joint
Ventures and joint ventures, taken as a whole, or a material adverse effect
on the financial condition, properties, business or annual results of
operations of ING and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree that the failure to obtain any
required consents or approvals as to which the Parent has actual knowledge
(as determined at the time and as set forth in Section 5.2(d)(iii)) shall not
give rise to a failure of the condition set forth in this Section 7.2(c) to
be satisfied.   (d) Client Approvals. The approvals contemplated in
Section 6.14 shall have been obtained for Fund Clients representing at least
85% of the total assets under management of Fund Clients as of the date
hereof. "Total assets under management" means the aggregate of the net assets
of the open-end and closed-end Fund Clients, as adjusted to eliminate
increases or decreases attributable exclusively to positive or negative
changes in the market value of portfolio assets as of the date hereof.  
(e) Legal Opinions. Parent shall have received an opinion or opinions of
counsel to the Company dated the Closing Date, addressing the legal matters
set forth in Section 7.2(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter.     -62- 
71   (f) Solvency Opinions. The Parent and the Company shall have received,
each as an addressee thereof, copies of the "solvency opinions" delivered in
connection with the Spin-Off.   (g) Spinco Debt Ratings. (i) At the
Effective Time, Spinco shall have a post-Spin-Off investment grade debt
rating of at least BBB from Standard and Poor\'s Corporation or Baa2 from
Moody\'s Investors Services, Inc. as to long-term senior unsecured debt (or
the equivalent for issuers which do not have long-term senior unsecured debt
outstanding) and (ii) the Company shall have delivered written evidence,
dated as of the Closing Date, from such rating agency evidencing such rating.
For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
possession of one such rating shall satisfy this condition.   7.3
Conditions to Obligation of the Company. The obligation of the Company to
effect the Merger is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by the
Company at or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:   (a)
Representations and Warranties. (i) The representations and warranties of
ING, Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement which are qualified by
"Parent Material Adverse Effect" shall each be true and correct as so
qualified as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date
as though made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent any
such representation or warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date), (ii)
the representations and warranties of ING, Parent and Merger Sub set forth
in Section 5.2(a), 5.2(b), 5.2(c) and 5.2(f) of this Agreement which are
not qualified by "Parent Material Adverse Effect" shall each be true and
correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the
extent any such representation or warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier
date), and (iii) the representations and warranties of ING, Parent and Merger
Sub set forth in this Agreement other than those contemplated by clauses (i)
and (ii) hereof (without giving effect to any qualifications as to
"materiality" or other similar qualifications) shall be true and correct as
of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on
and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent any such representation or
warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date), except where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be true and correct (without giving
effect to any qualifications as to "materiality" or other similar
qualifications) would not be, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Performance of
Obligations of ING, Parent and Merger Sub. Each of ING, Parent and Merger Sub
shall have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be
performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing       
-63-  72 Date, and the Company shall have received a certificate signed
on behalf of ING, Parent and Merger Sub by authorized officers of ING and
Parent to such effect.   (c) Consents Under Agreements. ING shall have
obtained the consent or approval of each Person whose consent or approval
shall be required in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under any Contract to which ING or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party, except those for which failure to obtain such consents and
approvals, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect and no Governmental Approvals required to be
obtained from any Governmental Entity by the Company or Spinco or any of
Spinco\'s Subsidiaries in connection with the consummation of the Spin-Off
shall be subject to terms or conditions reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, properties, business or annual results of operations of Spinco and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.   (d) Guarantee of Company Debt. ING
shall have entered into the supplemental indentures required by Section 6.19
of this Agreement.    ARTICLE VIII   Termination   8.1 Termination by
Mutual Consent. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
the approval by holders of shares of Common Stock of the Company referred to
in Section 7.1(a), by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent by
action of their respective boards of directors.   8.2 Termination by Either
Parent or the Company. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by action of the board of
directors of either the Company or Parent (and written notice to the other
party) if (a) the Merger shall not have been consummated by August 31, 2001
whether such date is before or after the date of approval by the holders of
Shares of the Company (the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that the
Termination Date shall be automatically extended for two (2) months (the
"Extended Date"), if, on August 31, 2001: (i) any of the Governmental
Consents described in 7.1(b) have not been obtained or waived, (ii) each of
the other conditions to the consummation of the Merger set forth in Article
VII has been satisfied or waived or remains capable of satisfaction, and
(iii) any Governmental Consent that has not yet been obtained is being
pursued diligently and in good faith; (b) the approval of the holders of
shares of Common Stock required by Section 7.1(a) shall not have
been obtained at a meeting duly convened therefor or at any     -64- 
73  adjournment or postponement thereof; (c) any Order permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger
shall become final and non-appealable (whether before or after the approval
by the shareholders of the Company); or (d) any Law is in effect or is
adopted or issued which has the effect of prohibiting the Spin-Off or the
Merger; provided further, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to clause (a) above shall not be available to any party that has
breached in any material respect its obligations under this Agreement in any
manner that shall have proximately contributed to the occurrence of the
failure of the Merger to be consummated.   8.3 Termination by the Company.
This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time
prior to the Effective Time if: (a) whether before or after the approval of
the holders of shares of Common Stock referred to in Section 7.1(a), by
action of the board of directors of the Company and written notice to Parent,
there has been a material breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
that is not curable and such breach would give rise to a failure of the
condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b); or (b) in accordance
with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section 6.2(b).   8.4
Termination by Parent. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by action of the board of
directors of Parent and written notice to the Company if: (a) the board of
directors of the Company shall have withdrawn or adversely modified its
adoption or recommendation of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or shall have approved or recommended an Acquisition Proposal; or (b)
there has been a material breach by the Company of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that is not
curable and such breach would give rise to a failure of the condition
set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b); or (c) Shares or other
securities or assets are issued or delivered pursuant to the terms of the
Rights Agreement upon or following the occurrence of a Section 13 Event (as
defined in the Rights Agreement) or an Acquiring Person (as defined in the
Rights Agreement) becoming such.   8.5 Effect of Termination and
Abandonment. (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the
abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, this Agreement
(other than as set forth in Section 9.1) shall become void and of no effect
with no liability on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its
directors, officers, employees, agents, legal and financial advisors or other
representatives); provided, however, that no such termination shall relieve
any party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any deliberate
breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such termination. The parties
further agree that if the Company is or becomes obligated to pay
a termination fee pursuant to Section 8.5(b), the right of Parent to receive
such termination fee shall be the sole remedy for damages of Parent with
respect to the facts     -65-  74  and circumstances giving rise to
such payment obligation except for any deliberate breach of this Agreement.
No party may assert a claim for damages for any inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement (whether by direct
claim or counterclaim) except in connection with the termination of this
Agreement.   (b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated
by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a), or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by
the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b), then the Company shall, promptly, but
in no event later than one business day after the date of such termination,
pay Parent a termination fee of one hundred sixty-five million dollars
($165,000,000) (the "Termination Fee") and shall promptly, but in no event
later than one business day after being notified of the amount of all
documented out-of-pocket charges and expenses incurred by Parent or Merger
Sub in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement up to a maximum of ten million dollars ($10,000,000) ("Out-of-
Pocket Expenses"), pay to Parent an amount equal to the Out-of-Pocket
Expenses, in each case payable by wire transfer of same day funds. In the
event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant
to Section 8.2(b) or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.4(b), then (A) the Company shall promptly, but in no event later
than one business day after being notified of the Out-of-Pocket Expenses by
Parent, pay to Parent an amount equal to the Out-of-Pocket Expenses, payable
by wire transfer of same day funds and (B) if, in the case of clause (i), a
bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have become public or any Person shall
have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a
proposal or offer relating to an Acquisition Proposal prior to the date of
the Shareholders Meeting or if, in the case of clause (ii), this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(b) as a result of a deliberate
breach by the Company and a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been
made to the Company or become public or any Person shall have announced to
the Company or publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional)
to make a proposal or offer relating to an Acquisition Proposal prior to the
date of termination, and in the case of each of clause (i) and clause (ii),
within fifteen (15) months from the date of termination, the Company executes
and delivers a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated (it being understood that in the
event the board of directors of the Company recommends the acceptance by the
shareholders of the Company of a third-party tender offer or exchange offer
for at least a majority of the outstanding Shares, such recommendation shall
be treated as though an agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal had
been executed), the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than one
business day after the date of such execution and delivery, or consummation,
as the case may be, pay Parent the Termination Fee. The Company acknowledges
that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5(b) are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to
this Section 8.5(b), and, in order to     -66-  75  obtain such
payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit which results in a judgment
against the Company for the fee set forth in this paragraph (b), the Company
shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub its costs and expenses
(including attorneys\' fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.   ARTICLE IX  
Miscellaneous and General   9.1 Survival. This Article IX and the agreements
of the Company, ING, Parent and Merger Sub contained in Article IV, Sections
6.7 (Stock Exchange), 6.11 (Expenses), 6.12 (Indemnification; Directors\' and
Officers\' Insurance), 6.13(b) and (c) (Compliance with 1940 Act Section 15),
6.19 (Company Debt), 6.22 (Headquarters and Related Matters), 6.23 (Asia) and
6.24 (Confidentiality) shall survive the consummation of the Merger. This
Article IX, the agreements of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in
Section 6.11 (Expenses) and Section 8.5 (Effect of Termination and
Abandonment) shall survive the termination of this Agreement. All other
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall
not survive the consummation of the Merger or the termination of this
Agreement (it being understood that this sentence shall not limit the rights
of any party hereto under Section 8.5 of this Agreement).   9.2
Modification or Amendment. (a) Subject to the provisions of the applicable
law, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may modify
or amend this Agreement, by written agreement executed and delivered by duly
authorized officers of the respective parties.   (b) Each of the parties
hereto acknowledges and agrees that, except as otherwise contemplated by the
relevant agreement, the Company may amend or modify any Transaction Agreement
(other than this Agreement) only with the written consent of Parent. Parent
agrees that it will not withhold any such consent if such proposed amendment
or modification would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect in any
respect any of ING, Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates, or prevent or materially delay or impair the
consummation of the transactions hereby.   9.3 Waiver of Conditions. The
conditions to each of the parties\' obligations to consummate the Merger are
for the sole benefit of such party and may be waived by such party in whole
or in part to the extent permitted by applicable law. No failure or delay by
any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall    
-67-  76  operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law.   9.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed
in any number of counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an

Representations. This Agreement (including, any annexes, exhibits or
schedules hereto or thereto and other documents executed in connection
herewith), the Company Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement,
dated May 25, 2000 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between Parent and the
Company constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements, understandings, representations and warranties, both written and
oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.   9.8 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section
6.12 (Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance), this Agreement
is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder.   9.9 Obligations of Parent and of the
Company. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the
part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company or Spinco to take any action,
such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the
Company to cause Spinco or such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the
Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Parent acknowledges that neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries possesses the power to control the Joint
Ventures. Accordingly, whenever this Agreement requires, or limits or
restricts the ability of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any
action with respect to a Joint Venture or joint venture, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to have fully satisfied all of such obligations
under this Agreement with respect to such Joint Venture or joint venture if
it has used its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Venture or joint
venture, as the case may be, to comply with such obligations under this
Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not require the
Company, its Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures or joint ventures to (i) take or
fail to take any action that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
in any respect any of Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries or prevent or
materially delay or impair the consummation of the Transactions or (ii) pay
any money to any third party in connection with carrying out its obligations
under this sentence.   9.10 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the Merger and the Spin-
Off shall be paid in accordance with the Distribution Agreement.   9.11
Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the
validity or enforceability or the other provisions hereof. If any provision
of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or
any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid
or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.     -71-  80  9.12
Interpretation. The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience
of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a
reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Annex, such reference
shall be to a Section of or Annex to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation". Unless the context otherwise requires, the use of the
singular shall include the plural, the use of the masculine shall include the
feminine, and vice versa. As used in this Agreement, the antecedent of any
personal pronoun shall be deemed to be only the next preceding proper noun or
nouns, as appropriate for such pronoun. As used in this Agreement, any
reference to any law, rule or regulation shall be deemed to include a
reference to any amendments, revisions or successor provisions to such law,
rule or regulation. Except as otherwise explicitly provided herein, all
references in this Agreement to (i) the "Company," "ING" or "Parent" shall be
deemed to be a reference only to such company and not to any direct or
indirect subsidiaries of such company or (ii) to documents or other materials
having been "made available" to Parent shall be deemed to be a reference to a
document or other materials made available to Parent in the Company\'s data
room in Hartford, Connecticut before June 9, 2000 or was actually delivered
to an employee or Representative of Parent.   9.13 Assignment. This
Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law or otherwise; provided,
however, that Parent may designate, by written notice to the Company, another
wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary to be a Constituent     -72- 
81 Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references herein
to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other subsidiary, except
that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger
Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and
warranties made with respect to such other subsidiary as of the date of such
designation.    9.14 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof in any federal court located in the State of New York, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the

conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement or any Distribution Document,
except as otherwise expressly set forth therein, effective prior to or as of

except as otherwise expressly set forth therein, effective as of

accordance with their terms all Spinco Group Liabilities.   (b) Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement or any
Distribution Document, except as otherwise expressly set forth therein,

and discharge when due in accordance with their terms all Aetna Group

Transfer Assets. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to transfer or assign any
asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting
therefrom if an  16   103 attempted assignment thereof, without the
necessary consent of a third party, would constitute a breach or other
contravention thereof or in any way adversely affect the rights of Spinco, or
any member of the Spinco Group, or Aetna, or any member of the Aetna Group,
thereunder. Spinco and Aetna shall cooperate with each other, keep each other
informed and will, subject to Section 7.03, use their reasonable best efforts

required in connection with the transfer or assignment pursuant to Sections
2.02 or 2.03 of any such asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder. Until such required consent is obtained, or if such consent
cannot be obtained or an attempted assignment thereof would be ineffective or
would adversely affect the rights of the transferor thereunder so that the
intended transferee would not in fact receive substantially all such rights,
Spinco and Aetna will cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under
which the intended transferee would obtain the benefits and assume the
obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement, including (but not
limited to) sub-contracting, sub-licensing or sub-leasing to such transferee,
or under which the transferor would enforce for the benefit of the transferee
and (except as otherwise provided herein or in any Ancillary Agreement) at
the transferee\'s expense any and all rights of the transferor against, with
the transferee assuming the transferor\'s obligations to, each third party
thereto. In the case of any Transfer involving a third party consent, the
transferor shall not agree to any terms of transfer (without the prior
written consent of the transferee) which have the effect of materially
altering the rights or benefits arising under any of the particular Spinco
Assets or the Aetna Assets, as the case may be subject to the Transfer.  
ARTICLE 3   THE DISTRIBUTION   SECTION 3.01. Cooperation Prior to the
Distribution. (a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this

best efforts to comply with all applicable foreign securities laws in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary
Agreements.   (d) Spinco shall prepare, file and pursue an application to
permit the listing of the Spinco Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange

engage in their respective businesses, (y) each of Aetna and Spinco will
be able to pay its respective debts as they become due in the usual course
of business and (z) neither Aetna\'s nor Spinco\'s total assets will be less

distributions and applicable fraudulent transfer and fraudulent conveyance
laws;   (e the contributions referred to in Section 2.01, the
transfers referred to in Sections 2.02 and 2.03, and the assumptions of
Liabilities referred to in Section 2.04 of this Agreement shall have been
effected;   18   105  (f each of the Ancillary Agreements shall have been
duly executed and delivered by the parties thereto; and   (g each condition
to the Merger set forth in Sections 7.1(a), (b) and (c), 7.2 and 7.3 of the
Merger Agreement shall have been satisfied or waived.   SECTION 3.03. The
Distribution. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, (i) immediately prior to the Distribution Time, Aetna shall

of record on the Record Date, a stock certificate or certificates, endorsed
by Aetna in blank, representing all of the then-outstanding shares of Spinco
Common Stock owned by Aetna, (ii) the Distribution shall be effective as of
the Distribution Time and (iii) Aetna shall instruct the Distribution
Agent to distribute, on or as soon as practicable after the Distribution
Date, to each Aetna Shareholder of record as of the Record Date one share of
Spinco Common Stock (together with the associated preferred share purchase
rights) for every one share of Aetna Common Stock so held. Spinco agrees to
provide all certificates for shares of Spinco Common Stock that Aetna shall
require (after giving effect to Sections 3.04 and 3.05) in order to effect
the Distribution. The Merger and Distribution shall be effected such that the
Merger Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and the shares of
Spinco Common Stock to be distributed in the Distribution are payable
and distributable, as applicable, only to the same Aetna Shareholders.  
SECTION 3.04. Stock Dividend. On or before the Distribution Date, Spinco
shall issue to Aetna as a stock dividend the number of shares of
Spinco Common Stock (together with the associated preferred share purchase
rights) that are required to effect the Distribution, as certified by the
Distribution Agent. In connection with the Distribution, Aetna shall deliver
to Spinco for cancellation all of the share certificates currently held by it
representing Spinco Common Stock.   SECTION 3.05. Fractional Shares. No
certificates representing fractional shares of Spinco Common Stock will be
distributed in the Distribution. The Distribution Agent will be directed to
determine the number of whole shares and fractional shares of Spinco Common
Stock allocable to each Aetna Shareholder of record as of the Record Date.
Upon the determination by the Distribution Agent of such number of fractional
shares, as soon as practicable after the Distribution Date, the Distribution
Agent, acting on behalf of the holders thereof, shall sell such fractional
shares for cash on the open market in each case at the then prevailing market
prices and shall disburse to each holder entitled thereto, in lieu of any
fractional share, without interest, that holder\'s ratable share of the
proceeds of that sale, after making appropriate deductions of the amount
required, if any, to be withheld for United States federal income Tax
purposes.    19   106  ARTICLE 4   INDEMNIFICATION AND OTHER

and hold harmless each Aetna Indemnitee and each Person, if any, who controls

or supplemented if Spinco shall have furnished any amendments or
supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
to the extent that those Damages are caused by any such untrue statement or
omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information that
is furnished to Spinco by Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than any
member of the Aetna Group) specifically for use therein.   SECTION 4.02.
Aetna Indemnification of Spinco Group. (a Subject to Section 4.03, from and
after the Distribution Date, Aetna shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each member of the Spinco Group, their Affiliates and their respective

arising out of (i) any and all Aetna Group Liabilities and (ii) the breach by
any member of the Aetna Group of any obligation under any Distribution
Document (subject to any limitation set forth therein), other than the Tax
Sharing Agreement (all indemnities thereunder being governed by the specific
terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement).   (b Subject to Section 4.03, from and
after the Distribution Date, Aetna shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each Spinco Indemnitee and each   20   107  Person, if any, who controls
any Spinco Indemnitee within the meaning of either Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all
Damages caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a

or omission based upon information that is furnished to Spinco by Parent or
any of its Affiliates (other than any member of the Aetna Group) specifically
for use therein.   SECTION 4.03. Insurance and Third Party Obligations;
Limitation on Liability. (a Upon indemnification of the Indemnified Party (as
defined below), the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the rights of
the Indemnified Party against the insurer or other third party with respect
to such indemnified amount. It is expressly agreed that no insurer or any
other third party shall be (i) entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled
to receive in the absence of the foregoing indemnification provisions, (ii)
relieved of the responsibility to pay any Insured Claims or any other claims
to which it is obligated or (iii) entitled to any subrogation rights with
respect to any obligation hereunder.   (b Each party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to mitigate its Damages and not to cause or worsen
any Liability which would be a Liability of the other party. If an
Indemnified Party shall receive any amount of Insurance Proceeds or any other
amount from a third party in connection with a specific Liability giving rise
to indemnification hereunder (i) at any time subsequent to the actual receipt
of a payment in full indemnification of such Liability hereunder, then such
Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any such
indemnification payment made up to the amount of such Insurance Proceeds or
other amounts actually received or (ii) at any time prior to the receipt of
any indemnification payment in respect of such Liability hereunder, then the
indemnification to be paid under Section 4.01 or 4.02 shall be paid net of
the amount of any such Insurance Proceeds or other amounts actually received.
Notwithstanding this Section 4.03, (x) in no event shall any Indemnified
Party be required (i) to take any action, or forebear from exercising any
right, under the Merger Agreement or any Distribution Document or (ii) to
take any action with respect to, make any demand under or claim any coverage
in connection with, any Policy, and (y) nothing herein shall permit any
Indemnifying Party to delay or refrain from making any payment to
any Indemnified Party because of the availability or alleged availability of
any Policy or Insurance Proceeds (provided   21   108  that the
foregoing shall not limit the subrogation rights of an Indemnifying Party
under Section 4.03(a)).   SECTION 4.04. Notice and Payment of Claims. If any
Aetna Indemnitee or Spinco Indemnitee (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") determines
that it is or may be entitled to indemnification by any party (the
"INDEMNIFYING PARTY") under this Article 4 (other than in connection with any
Action subject to Section 4.05), the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying, to the extent reasonably
practicable, the basis for its claim for indemnification and the amount for
which the Indemnified Party reasonably believes it is entitled to be
indemnified. Within 30 calendar days after receipt of such notice, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the Indemnified Party such amount in cash or
other immediately available funds unless the Indemnifying Party objects in
writing to the claim for indemnification or the amount thereof. In the event
of such an objection or failure to pay by the Indemnifying Party, the amount,
if any, that is Finally Determined to be required to be paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such indemnity claim shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party in cash within 15 calendar days
after such indemnity claim has been so Finally Determined, with interest
thereon at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect from time to time for
the period commencing on the 30th day following receipt of the initial notice
of the claim from the Indemnified Party until the date of actual payment
(inclusive).   SECTION 4.05. Notice and Defense of Third-Party Claims. (a
Promptly (and in any event within 10 Business Days) following the earlier of
(i) receipt of notice, whether by service of process or otherwise, of the
commencement by a third party of any Action against or otherwise involving
any Indemnified Party or (ii) receipt of information from a third party
alleging the existence of a claim against an Indemnified Party, in either
case, with respect to which indemnification may be sought pursuant to this
Agreement (a "THIRD-PARTY CLAIM"), the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party written notice thereof. The failure of the Indemnified
Party to give notice as provided in this Section 4.05 shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by
such failure to give notice.   (b Within 30 calendar days after receipt of
notice from the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 4.05(a), the
Indemnifying Party may (by giving written notice thereof to the Indemnified
Party) elect at its option to, and shall at the request of the Indemnified
Party, assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying
Party\'s sole cost and expense unless the Indemnifying Party objects in
writing to such indemnification claim (in which case the Indemnified Party
may not require the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense and the  
22   109  Indemnifying Party shall only assume the defense with the
consent of the Indemnified Party). During such 30-calendar day period, unless
and until the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim
or objects in writing, the Indemnified Party shall take such action as it
deems appropriate, acting in good faith, in connection with the Third-Party
Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall not settle or
compromise, or make any offer to settle or compromise, the Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld).   (c If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, (w) it shall keep the Indemnified Party
timely informed of all significant developments in connection therewith, (x)
the defense shall be conducted by counsel retained by the Indemnifying Party,
provided that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in
such proceedings and to be represented by counsel of its own choosing at the
Indemnified Party\'s sole cost and expense; and (y) the Indemnifying Party
may settle or compromise the Third-Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party so long as such settlement or compromise
includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all claims
that are the subject of such Third-Party Claim, provided that the
Indemnifying Party may not agree to any such settlement or compromise
pursuant to which there is any finding or admission of any violation of Law
or pursuant to which any remedy or relief (including but not limited to the
imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree which would restrict the
future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof), other than monetary damages for which the Indemnifying
Party shall be responsible hereunder, shall be applied to or against the
Indemnified Party, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld).   (d If the Indemnifying Party
has not objected in writing to such indemnification claim, and, if at the end
of the 30-calendar day period referred to in Section 4.05(b) the Indemnifying
Party has not assumed the defense of such claim, or, if earlier, beginning at
such time as the Indemnifying Party has declined in writing to assume the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, (x) the Indemnified Party will take such
steps as it deems appropriate to defend that Third-Party Claim and the
defense shall be conducted by counsel retained by the Indemnified Party,
provided that the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in
such proceedings and to be represented by counsel of its own choosing at the
Indemnifying Party\'s sole cost and expense; and (y) the Indemnifying Party
shall reimburse the Indemnified Party on a current basis (and in any event
within 30-calendar days after the submission of invoices and bills by an
Indemnified Party) for its expenses of investigation, attorneys\' and expert
witnesses\' fees and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in defending
against such Third-Party Claim and   23   110  the Indemnifying Party
shall be bound by the result obtained with respect thereto by the Indemnified
Party; provided further, that the Indemnified Party shall not settle or
compromise, or make any offer to settle or compromise, the Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld).   (e The Indemnifying Party shall pay to (or at
the direction of) the Indemnified Party in cash the amount, if any, for which
the Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified hereunder within 15
calendar days after such Third Party Claim has been Finally Determined, in
the case of an indemnity claim as to which the Indemnifying Party has
acknowledged liability or, in the case of any indemnity claim as to which the
Indemnifying Party has not acknowledged liability, within 15 calendar days
after such Indemnifying Party\'s liability, if any, hereunder has been
Finally Determined.   (f Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Aetna acknowledges and agrees that Spinco shall (solely at its own
cost and expense) assume and continue the defense of all the Spinco
Litigation and that, as long as such settlement or compromise includes an
unconditional release of all Aetna Indemnitees, Spinco shall be permitted to
settle or compromise such Actions without the consent of Aetna or any of its
Affiliates provided that Spinco may not agree to any such settlement or
compromise pursuant to which there is any finding or admission of any
violation of Law or pursuant to which any remedy or relief (including but not
limited to the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree which
would restrict the future activity or conduct of the Aetna Indemnitees),
other than monetary damages for which the Spinco shall be responsible
hereunder, shall be applied to or against the such Aetna Indemnitee, without
the prior written consent of such Aetna Indemnitee (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld); provided, further, that Spinco shall use its
reasonable best efforts to defend any Aetna Indemnitee and to cause any Aetna
Indemnitee to be dismissed with prejudice as a party to any pending or future
Spinco Litigation and, to the extent any Aetna Indemnitee believes, in its
reasonable judgment, that Spinco has failed to diligently pursue such defense
or dismissal, the Aetna Indemnitee shall be entitled (at its own cost and
expense) to independently move for or otherwise pursue such defense
or dismissal and to take such related actions as it may deem necessary
or appropriate in connection therewith. Spinco shall keep Aetna timely
informed of all significant developments with respect to the Spinco
Litigation to which any Aetna Indemnitee is a party.   (g Subject to
Article 6, each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective
Representatives to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third-
Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings,   24   111   hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.   SECTION 4.06. Non-
Exclusivity of Remedies. The remedies provided for in this Article 4 are not
exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be
available to any Indemnified Party at law or in equity. If the
indemnification provided for in this Article 4 is unavailable to
any Indemnified Party (x) that is a member of the Aetna Group on the grounds
that such Indemnified Party was a former Affiliate of Spinco or (y) on other
public policy grounds, then the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the
Indemnified Party\'s parent such amount that represents the diminution in
value to such parent as a result of the Indemnifying Party\'s inability to so
indemnify such Indemnified Party (provided that such amount shall not exceed
the amount that would otherwise have been payable by the Indemnifying Party
to such Indemnified Party in respect of such claim pursuant to this Article
4).   ARTICLE 5   EMPLOYEE MATTERS AND TRANSITION SERVICES   SECTION
5.01. Employee Matters Generally. With respect to employee matters and
employee benefits arrangements, the parties hereto agree as set forth herein
and in the Employee Benefits Agreement and in the Tax Sharing Agreement.  
SECTION 5.02. Transition Services Matters Generally. With respect to the
provision of certain transition services by either Group to the other
Group after the Distribution Time, the parties hereto agree as set forth
herein and in the Transition Services Agreement, the Lease Agreement and the
Software Licensing Agreement.   ARTICLE 6   ACCESS TO INFORMATION  
SECTION 6.01. Provision of Corporate Records. Except as
otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, immediately prior to or as soon as practicable following the
Distribution Date, each Group shall provide to the other Group all documents,
Contracts, books, records and data (including but not limited to minute
books, stock registers, stock certificates and documents of title) in its
possession relating primarily to the other Group or its   25  
112 business, assets and affairs (after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated hereby); provided that if any such documents,
Contracts, books, records or data relate to both Groups or the business and
operations of both Groups, each such Group shall provide to the other Group
true and complete copies of such documents, Contracts, books, records or
data. Data stored in electronic form shall be provided in the format in which
it existed at the Distribution Date, except as otherwise specifically set
forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.   SECTION 6.02. Access
to Information. From and after the Distribution Date, each Group shall, for a
reasonable period of time, afford promptly to the other Group and its
accountants, counsel and other designated Representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours to all documents, Contracts, books, records,
computer data and other data in such Group\'s possession relating to such
other Group or the business and affairs of such other Group (after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated hereby) (other than data and
information subject to (i) an attorney/client or other privilege that is not
specifically subject to the provisions of this Article 6 or (ii) in the case
of access provisions in any joint defense arrangements between a member
or members of one Group and a member or members of the other Group, the terms
of the relevant joint defense agreement), insofar as such access is
reasonably required by such other Group, including, without limitation, for
audit, accounting, litigation, regulatory compliance and disclosure and
reporting purposes.   SECTION 6.03. Litigation Cooperation. From and after
the Distribution Date: (a) Each Group shall use all reasonable best efforts
to make available to the other Group and its accountants, counsel, and other
designated representatives, upon written request, its current and former
directors, officers, employees and representatives as witnesses, and shall
otherwise cooperate with the other Group, to the extent reasonably required
in connection with any Action or threatened Action arising out of either
Group\'s business and operations in which the requesting party may from time
to time be involved.   (b Each party hereto shall promptly notify the other
party hereto, upon its receipt or the receipt by any of its Affiliates, of a
request or requirement (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for
information or documents, subpoenas, civil investigative demands or other
similar processes) which relates to the business and operations of the other
party (a "REQUEST") reasonably regarded as calling for the inspection or
production of any documents or other information in its possession, custody
or control, as received from any Person that is a party in any Action, or in
the event the Person delivering the Request is not a party to such Action, as
received from such Person. In addition to complying with the applicable
provisions of Section 6.06, each party shall assert and maintain, or cause
its Affiliates to assert and maintain, any applicable claim to
privilege,    26   113  immunity, confidentiality or protection in
order to protect such documents and other information from disclosure, and
shall seek to condition any disclosure which may be required on such
protective terms as may be appropriate. No party may waive, undermine or fail
to take any action necessary to preserve an applicable privilege without the
prior written consent of the affected party hereto (or any affected Affiliate
or Affiliates of any such party) except, in the opinion of such party\'s
counsel, as required by law.   (c Aetna, on its own behalf and on behalf of
all of its Affiliates, hereby waives any conflict which might preclude
counsel currently representing Aetna, Spinco or any of their respective
Affiliates from representing Spinco and/or any of its Affiliates following
the Distribution Date in connection with the Spinco Litigation existing at
the Merger Effective Time.   (d Aetna and Spinco shall enter into such joint
defense agreements, in customary form, as Aetna and Spinco shall determine
are advisable.   SECTION 6.04. Reimbursement. Except to the extent that any
member of one Group is obligated to indemnify any member of the other Group
under Article 4 for that cost or expense, each Group providing information or
witnesses to the other Group, or otherwise incurring any expense in
connection with cooperating, under Sections 6.01, 6.02 or 6.03 shall be
entitled to receive from the recipient thereof, upon the presentation of
invoices therefor, payment for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses that may
be incurred in providing such information, witnesses or cooperation.  
SECTION 6.05. Retention of Records. From and after the Distribution Date,
except as otherwise required by law or agreed to in writing, each
party shall, and shall cause the members of its respective Group to, retain
all information relating to the other Group\'s business and operations in
accordance with the then general practice of such party with respect to
information relating to its own business and operations. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any party may destroy or otherwise dispose of any such information
at any time, provided that, prior to such destruction or disposal, (i) such
party shall provide not less than 90 calendar days\' prior written notice to
the other party, specifying the information proposed to be destroyed or
disposed of and the scheduled date for such destruction or disposal, and (ii)
if the recipient of such notice shall request in writing prior to the
scheduled date for such destruction or disposal that any of the information
proposed to be destroyed or disposed of be delivered to such requesting
party, the party proposing the destruction or disposal shall promptly arrange
for the delivery of such of the information as was requested at the expense
of the requesting party.   27   114    SECTION 6.06. Confidentiality.
From and after the Distribution Date, each party shall hold and shall cause
its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, counsel,
accountants, agents, consultants, advisors and other authorized
representatives ("REPRESENTATIVES") to hold in strict confidence all
documents and other information (other than any such documents and other
information relating solely to the business or affairs of such party)
concerning the other party and/or its Affiliates ("CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION")
unless such party is compelled to disclose such documents and/or other
information by judicial or administrative process or, in the opinion of its
counsel, by other requirements of law or the rules of any applicable
stock exchange. Confidential Information shall not include such documents
and/or other information which can be shown to have been (A) in the public
domain through no fault of such party, (B) lawfully acquired after the
Distribution Date on a non-confidential basis from other sources or (C)
acquired or developed independently by such party without violating this
Section 6.06 or the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
such party may disclose such Confidential Information to its Representatives
so long as such Persons are informed by such party of the confidential nature
of such Confidential Information and are directed by such party to treat such
documents and/or other information confidentially. In the event that such
party or any of its Representatives is requested or required (by oral
questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoenas,
civil investigative demands or other similar processes) to disclose any of
the Confidential Information, such party will promptly notify the other party
so that the other party may seek a protective order or other remedy or waive
such party\'s compliance with this Section 6.06. Such party shall exercise
reasonable best efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential
Information, including, but not limited to, by cooperating with the other
party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information.
If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the absence of
receipt of a waiver of the other party, such party or any of its
Representatives is nonetheless legally compelled to disclose any of the
Confidential Information, such party or such Representative may disclose only
that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required to be
disclosed. Such party agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Section
6.06 by it and/or its Representatives.   SECTION 6.07. Preservation of
Privilege. The parties hereto recognize that as a consequence of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements, the parties may have common interests in the defense of
certain pending or threatened litigation which may necessitate the exchange
between the parties or their counsel of documents or other information that
is subject to the attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine or
other legally recognized privileges, protections or immunities from  
28   115  discovery. Each party agrees to take in addition to, and not in
limitation of, its obligations under Section 6.03(b) all reasonable best and
necessary efforts to protect and maintain, and to cause its Affiliates to
protect and maintain, any applicable claim to privilege, immunity, protection
or confidentiality in order to protect such documents and other information
from improper disclosure or use. In addition to, and not in limitation of,
its obligations under Section 6.03(b) and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and to the maximum extent permitted by law, none of the
parties or their respective Affiliates may waive or undermine, or fail to
defend in a commercially reasonable manner, any privilege or protection or
take or fail to take any other commercially reasonable action (a) that could
result in the disclosure of any common-interest or joint-defense materials to
any Person that is neither a party to this Agreement nor an Affiliate of any
such party or (b) that would have the effect of waiving or undermining such
privilege or protection, in either case, without the prior written consent of
the affected party and any affected Affiliate of such affected party.  
SECTION 6.08. Inapplicability of Article 6 to Tax Matters. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Article 6, this Article 6 shall not apply
with respect to documents, other information and/or other matters relating to
Taxes, all of which shall be governed by the Tax Sharing Agreement.  
ARTICLE 7   CERTAIN OTHER AGREEMENTS   SECTION 7.01. Intercompany
Accounts. (a Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein or in any of
the Ancillary Agreements or in the Merger Agreement, (i) all intercompany
loan balances in existence as of the Distribution Time between any member of
the Aetna Group and any member of the Spinco Group will be settled or paid in
cash or other immediately available funds prior to or as of the Distribution
Time and (ii) all intercompany accounts receivable and accounts payable
between any member of one Group and any member of another Group in existence
at the Distribution Time shall be paid in full, in cash or other immediately

Distribution Time). It is understood and agreed that all or a portion of the
intercompany loan balances owed by Spinco to Aetna Services will be paid in
cash by Spinco.   (b At or prior to the Distribution Time, Aetna shall repay
or cause to be repaid all Short Term Debt of any member of the Aetna Group,
other than (i) not more than $17.4 million aggregate principal amount
(together with accrued and   29   116  unpaid interest thereon) of
Short Term Debt issued by Cruz Blanca S.A., AFP Santa Maria S.A., Aetna
Credito Hipotecario S.A., and Aetna Life Insurance Company of America, Taiwan
Branch, and (ii) any Short Term Debt of any Person that is not a Subsidiary
of Aetna.   (c) Except as otherwise contemplated hereby or as set forth
on Schedule 7.01 or in any of the other Ancillary Agreements or in the
Merger Agreement, all prior agreements and arrangements, including those
relating to goods, rights or services provided or licensed, between any
member of the Spinco Group and any member of the Aetna Group shall be
terminated effective as of the Distribution Time, if not previously
terminated. No such agreements or arrangements shall be in effect after the
Distribution Time unless embodied in this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements
or set forth on Schedule 7.01.   SECTION 7.02. Trademarks; Trade Names. (a)
Prior to the Distribution Time, Aetna and Spinco will enter into the
Trademark Assignment Agreement, the Chinese Mark Agreement and the Trademark
Licensing Agreement.   (b) From and after the Distribution Date, (i) Aetna
will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates to, use any of (A) the
Licensed Marks and Names, except as specifically permitted by the Trademark
License Agreement, and (B) the Spinco Group\'s logos, marks or names (other
than the Licensed Marks and Names), and (ii) Spinco will not, and will not
permit any of its Affiliates to, use the Aetna China Name Rights except as
specifically permitted by the Chinese Mark Agreement.   (c) From and after
the Distribution Date, Spinco will not, and will not permit any of its
Affiliates to, infringe upon the Aeltus Name Rights.   (d) As promptly as
practicable following the Distribution Time, Aetna will, and will cause Aetna

articles or certificate of incorporation or otherwise take all action
necessary to delete from their names the word "Aetna" or any marks and names
derived therefrom and shall do or cause to be done all other acts, including
the payment of any fees required in connection therewith, to cause such
amendments or other actions to become effective. Aetna will cause all other
members of the Aetna Group to take the foregoing actions with respect to the
names of the Aetna Subsidiaries as promptly as practicable prior to the end
of the Permitted Trademark Period.   (e) From and after the Distribution
Date, each party agrees to cooperate with the other party in connection with
any regulatory matters relating to the   30   117  Trademark Licensing
Agreement, the Chinese Mark Agreement and the Trademark Assignment
Agreement.   (f) Aetna acknowledges that from and after the Distribution
Date, notwithstanding the use of the marks and names (the "LICENSED MARKS AND
NAMES") licensed by Spinco as licensor pursuant to the Trademark Licensing
Agreement, the Aetna Name Rights will remain an asset of the Spinco Group and
shall include any goodwill associated with the use of the "Aetna" name, and
any derivative thereof, in combination with one or more of the Acquiror\'s
existing names or marks as permitted by the Trademark Licensing
Agreement.   SECTION 7.03. Further Assurances and Consents. In addition to
the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws, regulations
and agreements or otherwise to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation,
using its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents and approvals and to
make any filings and applications necessary or desirable in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that no
party hereto shall be obligated to pay any consideration therefor (except for
filing fees and other similar charges) to any third party from whom such
consents or approvals are requested or to take any action or omit to take any
action if the taking of or the omission to take such action would be
unreasonably burdensome to the party, its Group or its Group\'s business. The
parties agree to enter into and execute such additional Distribution
Documents as may be reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements,
provided, however that such additional Distribution Documents shall not
diminish any of the rights granted or increase any of the Liabilities assumed
under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.   SECTION 7.04.
Noncompetition and Non-Solicitation. (a)(i) For a period of three (3) years
following the Merger Effective Time, neither Spinco nor any of its Affiliates
(after giving effect to the Distribution), will engage in the following
businesses conducted by the Aetna Group immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time: (A) in the United States, underwriting and/or issuance of
defined contribution group annuities for pension plans maintained by employer
or similar groups pursuant to Section 401(k), 403(b) or 457 of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or any successor
law), underwriting and/or issuance of individual annuities, providing
investment advisory or broker-dealer services, or the management of mutual
funds, and (B) in those jurisdictions outside of the United States listed in
Schedule 7.04(a)(I), those businesses specified with respect   31  
118 to each such jurisdiction ((A) and (B) collectively, the
"Prohibited Businesses"), and (ii) for an additional period of 12 months, to
the extent that Spinco or any of its Affiliates (after giving effect to the
Distribution) engages directly or indirectly in any Prohibited Business, it
will do so using a brand other than "Aetna" (except and only to such extent
as may be required by Law); provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit
Spinco or any of its Affiliates from (x) conducting any of the activities set
forth in Schedule 7.04 (a)(II), (y) engaging in any Prohibited Business in
any jurisdiction specified in Schedule 7.04(a) if the Aetna Group ceases to
engage in such business in such jurisdiction, or (z) owning, acquiring or
investing in any Person, provided that if such Person derives in excess of
10% of its consolidated gross revenue in the most recently completed four
fiscal quarters from business activities which would be restricted hereunder,
Spinco will, or will cause such Affiliate to, divest a portion of such
business representing such excess within 12 months of the acquisition date
(unless, in the case of the restriction specified in (i) above, such 12-month
period would terminate subsequent to the termination of the 3-year
restriction period). It is understood that the restrictions set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence will not apply to any Person that acquires (by
acquisition, merger or otherwise) an interest in Spinco or any of its
Affiliates so long as such Person was not an Affiliate of Spinco that
was subject to such restrictions prior to the aforementioned acquisition,
merger or other acquisitive transaction (it being further understood that,
following the aforementioned acquisition, merger or other acquisitive
transaction, such restrictions will continue to apply to Spinco and its
Affiliates that were subject to such restrictions prior to such acquisition,
merger or other transaction).   (b) Except as otherwise permitted by any
Ancillary Agreement, for a period of two years from the Merger Effective
Date, neither Group nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly,
solicit or attempt to employ or employ any employee of the other Group.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restriction set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence shall not apply to (i) with respect to all employees other
than officers and other senior management of any member of a Group, any
Person who contacts such Group or any of its Affiliates in response to
general advertisements or searches or other broad-based hiring methods or
(ii) individuals who choose to leave for Good Reason the employment of, or
are terminated by, a Group without the other Group having taken any action
otherwise prohibited by this Section 7.04(b) . "GOOD REASON" for the purposes
of this Section 7.04(b) shall mean a significant or long-term reduction in
compensation, a relocation of more than 50 miles from the employee\'s current
place of employment or a material diminution of the employee\'s duties and
responsibilities.   (c) If any provision contained in this Section 7.04
shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such invalidity, illegality or   32   119 unenforceability
shall not affect any other provisions of this Section, but this Section shall
be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never
been contained herein. It is the intention of the parties that if any of the
restrictions or covenants contained herein is held to cover a geographic area
or to be for a length of time which is not permitted by applicable law, or in
any way construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision
shall not be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent
such provision would be valid or enforceable under applicable law, a court of
competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform this Section to
provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time
period and other provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as
shall be valid and enforceable under such applicable law. In addition to and
not in limitation of the parties\' obligations under Section 8.14, each of
the parties hereto acknowledges that the other party would be irreparably
harmed by any breach of this Section and that there would be no adequate
remedy at law or in damages to compensate such party for any such breach.
Each of the parties hereto agrees that the other party shall be entitled to
injunctive relief requiring specific performance by such party of this
Section, and consents to the entry thereof.   SECTION 7.05. Third Party
Beneficiaries. Acquiror and Parent shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Agreement. Except as contemplated in the preceding sentence, nothing
contained in this Agreement is intended to confer upon any Person or entity
other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns and Acquiror and Parent, any benefit, right or remedies under or by
reason of this Agreement, except that the provisions of Article 4 shall inure
to the benefit of the Spinco Indemnitees and the Aetna Indemnitees.  
SECTION 7.06. Intellectual Property Rights and Licenses. Except as otherwise
specifically set forth in this Agreement or in any of the other Ancillary
Agreements, neither Group shall have any right or license in or to any
technology, software, Intellectual Property Right or other proprietary right
owned, licensed or held for use by the other Group.   SECTION 7.07.
Insurance. (a) The Spinco Assets shall include any and all rights of an
insured party under each of the Group Policies, subject to the terms of such
Group Policies and any limitations or obligations of Spinco contemplated by
this Section 7.07 or Schedule 7.07, specifically including rights of
indemnity and the right to be defended by or at the expense of the insurer,
with respect to all Actions and Liabilities incurred or claimed to have been
incurred prior to the Distribution Date by any party in or in connection with
the conduct of any of the Spinco Group or the Aetna Group or their respective
businesses and operations, and which Actions and Liabilities may arise out of
an insured or insurable   33   120 occurrence under one or more of such
Group Policies. With respect to all of the applicable Group Policies, Spinco
shall use its reasonable best efforts, at its option, either (x) to cause
Aetna and its Affiliates to be named or maintained as additional insured
parties thereunder to the extent of, or (y) to obtain a run-off or tail
coverage policy with respect to, in each case, their respective insurable
interests in respect of the Aetna Group Liabilities incurred or claimed to
have been incurred prior to the Distribution Date and insured thereunder, and
the Aetna Assets shall include such rights, to the extent they relate to the
Aetna Group Liabilities, of an additional insured party under each such Group
Policy or under such run-off or tail policy, as applicable, subject to the
terms of such Policy.   (b) Spinco shall administer all Group Policies.
Where Aetna Group Liabilities are covered under the Group Policies for
periods prior to the Distribution Date, or under any Group Policy covering
claims made after the Distribution Date with respect to an action, error,
omission or occurrence prior to the Distribution Date, then from and after
the Distribution Date, upon request from Aetna, Spinco shall claim coverage
for Insured Claims under such Group Policy as and to the extent that such
insurance is available (subject to Section 7.07(c)) up to the full extent of
the applicable limits of liability of such Group Policy.   (c) Spinco shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause Insurance Proceeds received with
respect to claims, costs and expenses under the Group Policies (i) relating
to Aetna Group Liabilities, to be paid directly to Aetna (or the applicable
member of the Aetna Group) and (ii) relating to the Spinco Group Liabilities
to be paid directly to Spinco (or the applicable member of the Spinco Group).
In the event Spinco has been unable to cause Insurance Proceeds to be paid
directly to a Aetna Group member in accordance with the preceding sentence,
or to cause Aetna and its Affiliates to be named or maintained as additional
insureds or to obtain run-off or tail policies in accordance with the last
sentence of Section 7.07(a), Spinco shall inform Aetna of the reasons
therefor and Aetna shall be entitled, at its own cost and expense, to take
such actions as may be necessary to achieve such payment or such additional
insured status or to obtain such run-off or tail policy (so long as such
actions are not materially adverse to Spinco). Payment of the allocable
portions of indemnity costs out of Insurance Proceeds resulting from such
Group Policies will be made by Spinco to the appropriate party upon receipt
from the insurance carrier (to the extent not paid directly to a Aetna Group
member pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 7.01(c)). In the event
that the aggregate limits on any Group Policies are exceeded by the aggregate
of outstanding Insured Claims by the parties hereto, the parties shall agree
on an equitable allocation of Insurance Proceeds based upon their respective
bona fide claims. Each party agrees to use reasonable best efforts to
maximize available coverage under those Group Policies applicable to such  
34   121 party, and to take all reasonable steps to recover from all other
responsible parties in respect of an Insured Claim to the extent coverage
limits under a Group Policy have been exceeded or would be exceeded as a
result of such Insured Claim. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Spinco shall not be required to renew, extend or expand the
coverage available under any of the Group Policies provided, that prior to
any termination (or failure to reinstate) such Group Policies with respect to
coverage of any Aetna Group Liabilities insured thereunder, Spinco shall
afford Aetna the opportunity of taking such commercially reasonable steps as
may be necessary to maintain such coverage in place.   SECTION 7.08.
Prohibition on Certain Sales. Aetna agrees that for one year from the Merger
Effective Time, unless there is a material change at Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries, Aetna will not sell or permit to be sold the interests of Aetna
International, Inc. in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Malaysia; provided, that the
foregoing shall not limit the right of Aetna to sell minority interests in
such Subsidiaries.   SECTION 7.09. Brazilian Certificate of Foreign Capital
Registration . Prior to the Distribution Date, Aetna shall use its reasonable
best efforts to provide to Parent a copy of the Certificate of Foreign
Capital Registration for Sul America Aetna Seguros e Previdencia S.A., and if
not prior to the Distribution Date, Spinco shall provide such certificate to
Parent within one year from the Distribution Date.   ARTICLE 8

expenses of all counsel, accountants and financial and other advisors of both
Groups in connection therewith, and all expenses in connection with
preparation, filing and printing of the Form 10, the Information Statement

specifically provided otherwise herein, in the Merger Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement.   (b) Each reference in this Agreement to expenses,

costs as the party incurring such expenses, fees or out-of-pocket costs would
reasonably incur in connection with its own business under circumstances
where such expenses, fees and out-of-pocket costs are not subject to
reimbursement.   SECTION 8.04. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided that neither
party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent
and the other party hereto. If any party or any of its successors or assigns
(i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall
be   37   124  made so that the successors and assigns of such party
shall assume all of the obligations of such party under the Distribution
Documents.   SECTION 8.05. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed
in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of Delaware,
without regard to the conflict of laws rules thereof.   SECTION 8.06.
Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This
Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto.   SECTION 8.07. Entire
Agreement. This Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the other Distribution Documents constitute the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all prior agreements, understandings and negotiations,
both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof. No representation, inducement, promise, understanding,
condition or warranty not set forth herein or in the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the other Distribution Documents has been
made or relied upon by any party hereto. To the extent that the provisions of
this Agreement are inconsistent with the provisions of any other Ancillary
Agreement, the provisions of such other Ancillary Agreement shall
prevail.   SECTION 8.08. Tax Sharing Agreement; Set-Off; Payment of After-
Tax Amounts; Certain Transfer Taxes. (a) Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein and not inconsistent with the Tax Sharing Agreement, this
Agreement shall not govern any Tax, and any and all claims, losses, damages,
demands, costs, expenses or liabilities relating to Taxes shall be
exclusively governed by the Tax Sharing Agreement.   (b) If, at the time
Spinco is required to make any payment to Aetna or any of its Affiliates
under this Agreement, Aetna or any of its Affiliates owes Spinco or any of
its Affiliates any amount under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement,
then such amounts shall be offset and the excess shall be paid by the party
liable for such excess. Similarly, if at the time Aetna is required to make
any payment to Spinco or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement, and
Spinco or any of its Affiliates owes Aetna or any of its Affiliates any
amount under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, then such amounts
shall be offset and the excess shall be paid by the party liable for such
excess.   38   125    (c) If Aetna, Spinco or any of their respective
post-Distribution Affiliates makes a payment pursuant to Section 4.01 or 4.02
of this Agreement, then such Person shall also pay the recipient of such
payment the related After-Tax Amount (as defined in the Tax Sharing
Agreement). This Section 8.08(c) shall be interpreted in accordance with the
principles set forth in the Tax Sharing Agreement and shall be subject to the
dispute resolution provisions contained in Section 10.09 of the Tax Sharing
Agreement.   (d) Except as otherwise provided in the Ancillary Agreements,
all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp and registration taxes and
fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with any
of the transactions described in Article 2 of this Agreement shall be borne
and paid equally by Spinco and Aetna. The party that is required by
applicable law to file any Return (as defined in the Tax Sharing Agreement)
or make any payment with respect to any of those taxes shall do so, and the
other party shall cooperate with respect to that filing or payment as
necessary. The non-paying party shall reimburse the paying party in
accordance with this Section 8.08, as appropriate, within 5 Business Days
after it receives notice of the payment of those taxes. This Section 8.08(d)
shall be interpreted in accordance with the principles set forth in the Tax
Sharing Agreement and shall be subject to the dispute resolution provisions
contained in Section 10.09 of the Tax Sharing Agreement.   SECTION 8.09.
Jurisdiction. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, any
Action seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby may be brought in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware, and each of the parties hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such
court (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Action
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
Action in any such court or that any such Action which is brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such Action
may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without
the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each
party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section
8.01 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.   SECTION
8.10. Pre-Litigation Dispute Resolution. Prior to the bringing of any Action
against the other, senior officers of Aetna and Spinco shall confer, consult
and in good faith attempt for a period of 30 calendar days to resolve any
dispute between such parties relating to this Agreement or any of the
Ancillary Agreements (other than the Tax Sharing Agreement) without resort to
legal remedies.    39   126   SECTION 8.11. Severability. If any one or
more of the provisions contained in this Agreement should be declared
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions contained in this Agreement shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a declaration, the
parties shall modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner so that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated
to the fullest extent possible.   SECTION 8.12. Survival. All covenants and
agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive the Distribution Date indefinitely, unless a specific
survival or other applicable period is expressly set forth therein.  
SECTION 8.13. Captions. The captions herein are included for convenience of
reference only and shall be ignored in the construction or interpretation
hereof.   SECTION 8.14. Specific Performance. Each party to this
Agreement acknowledges and agrees that damages for a breach or threatened
breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement would be inadequate and
irreparable harm would occur. In recognition of this fact, each party agrees
that, if there is a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any damages,
the other nonbreaching party to this Agreement, without posting any bond,
shall be entitled to seek and obtain equitable relief in the form of specific
performance, temporary restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction,
attachment, or any other equitable remedy which may then be available to
obligate the breaching party (i) to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or (ii) if the breaching party is unable, for whatever reason, to
perform those obligations, to take any other actions as are necessary,
advisable or appropriate to give the other party to this Agreement the
economic effect which comes as close as possible to the performance of those
obligations (including, but not limited to, transferring, or granting liens
on, the assets of the breaching party to secure the performance by the
breaching party of those obligations).   40   127    IN WITNESS WHEREOF
the parties hereto have caused this Distribution Agreement to be duly
executed by their respective authorized officers as of the date first above
