Dissenting Stock) delivers a Letter of Transmittal in the form of _Exhibit F_
hereto (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and a certificate representing,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, Company Stock (a " _Certificate_ ")

 by a Company Stockholder (other than a holder of Dissenting Stock) to the
Surviving Corporation of a Certificate, together with a Letter of Transmittal,
duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, such
Company Stockholder shall be entitled to receive, as soon as practicable but
in no event later than five (5) Business Days after such surrender, in
exchange therefor, cash in an amount set forth for such Company Stockholder
in the Distribution Waterfall, which amounts shall be paid by the Paying Agent
by check or wire transfer in accordance with the instructions provided by such
Company Stockholder. No interest or dividends will be paid or accrued on the
consideration payable upon the surrender or transfer of any Certificate. If
the consideration provided for herein is to be delivered in the name of a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate was surrendered, it
shall be a condition of such delivery that the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer. Until
surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.7(b)_, each
Certificate (other than those representing Dissenting Shares or Company Stock
to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)_) shall represent, for all
purposes, only the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the portion of
the Final Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 2.6(a)_ in respect of the Company Stock formerly evidenced by such
Certificate, without any interest or dividends thereon.

 

(c) Neither Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to a
holder of Certificates or any other Person in respect of any cash delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered or
transferred by the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date (or immediately prior
to such earlier date on which any Final Merger Consideration, dividends
(whether in cash, stock or property) or other distributions with respect to
Company Stock in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any foreign, federal, state or local governments or
governmental agency), any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(d) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of loss and indemnity (in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation) of that fact by the Person
(who shall be the record owner of such Certificate) claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Final Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

2.8 _No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Stock_. The portion of the
Final Merger Consideration paid in respect of the surrender for exchange of
Company Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Stock, and, upon
the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of Company Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

2.9 _Repaid Indebtedness; Unpaid Sellers  Transaction Expenses_. It is
contemplated by the parties that, upon the Closing, all Indebtedness for
borrowed money of the Company Group as of the Closing Date, which is listed on
the " _Repaid Indebtedness Schedule_ " attached hereto, will be fully repaid
(the " _Repaid Indebtedness_ ") and that such repayment will be funded by
Purchaser. In order to facilitate such repayment, prior to the Closing, the
Company shall obtain payoff letters from the holders of all Repaid
Indebtedness of the Company Group,

 which payoff letters shall acknowledge the aggregate principal amount and
all accrued but unpaid interest required to discharge such Repaid Indebtedness
at the Closing and include an undertaking by each such holder to discharge,
or authorize the discharge of, any Liens securing any portion of such Repaid
Indebtedness, upon payment of the Repaid Indebtedness owed to such holder (the
" _Payoff Letters_ "). In addition, it is contemplated by the parties hereto
that, upon the Closing, all of the Unpaid Sellers Transaction Expenses (to
the extent not paid by the Company Group prior to the Closing and as set forth
and in accordance with the final bills and wire transfer instructions
delivered by the Company to Purchaser no later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing) will be fully paid, and that such payment will be funded
by Purchaser. Subject to the satisfaction of the Company Groups conditions,
covenants and obligations to be satisfied prior to the Closing, in connection
with the Closing, Purchaser shall make payment of the Unpaid Sellers
Transaction Expenses on the Closing Date (or, in the case of
employment Taxes, that are included in Sellers Transaction Expenses, on the
date due to the applicable Governmental Authority) in order to discharge the
amounts payable thereunder.

(a) _Determination of Closing Adjustment_. No later than three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause to be prepared and

Working Capital (prepared in accordance with the " _Working Capital Schedule_
" attached hereto) as of the close of business on the day prior to the
Closing Date (" _Estimated Working Capital_ "), (ii) a good faith estimate of
the aggregate amount of all Cash of the Company Group as of the close of
business on the day prior to the Closing Date (" _Estimated Cash_ "), (iii) a
good faith estimate of the aggregate amount of all Indebtedness of the Company
Group as of immediately prior to the Closing (" _Estimated Indebtedness_ ")
and after giving effect to the repayment of all Repaid Indebtedness, (iv) a
good faith estimate of the aggregate amount of all Closing Income Taxes as of
the Closing (the " _Estimated Closing Income Taxes_ ") and (iv) the amount by
which the Aggregate Initial Consideration is to be adjusted on account of the
foregoing.

(b) _Determination of Post-Closing Adjustment_. No later than forty-five (45)
days following the Closing, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the
Sellers Representative a statement setting forth (i) the calculation of the
actual Working Capital as of the close of business on the day prior to
the Closing Date (" _Actual Working Capital_ ") (prepared in accordance with
the " _Working Capital Schedule_ " attached hereto), (ii) a calculation of the
actual Cash of the Company Group as of the close of business on the day prior
to the Closing Date (" _Actual Cash_ ") and (iii) a calculation of the actual
Indebtedness of the Company Group as of immediately prior to the Closing ("
_Actual Indebtedness_ ") and after giving effect to the repayment of all
Repaid Indebtedness.

(c) _Disputed Final Adjustment_.

 

(i) No later than thirty (30) days following the delivery by Purchaser of the
calculation of Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash and Actual Indebtedness,
the Sellers Representative shall notify Purchaser in writing whether it
accepts or disputes the accuracy of the calculation of Actual Working Capital,
Actual Cash and Actual Indebtedness. During such thirty (30) day period, the
Sellers Representative and its agents shall be provided with such access to
the financial books and records of Purchaser and the Company Group as well as
any relevant work papers as it may reasonably request to enable it to
evaluate the Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash and Actual

 



18 Confidential

 



 

 Indebtedness. If the Sellers Representative accepts the calculation of
Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash and Actual Indebtedness determined
pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_, or if the Sellers Representative fails
within such thirty (30) day period to notify Purchaser of any dispute with
respect thereto, then the calculation of Actual Working Capital determined
pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_ shall be the " _Final Working Capital,_ " the
calculation of Actual Cash determined pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_ shall be
the " _Final Cash_ " and the calculation of Actual Indebtedness determined
pursuant to  _Section 2.10(b)_ shall be the " _Final Indebtedness,_ " which,
in each case, shall be deemed final and conclusive and binding.

 

(ii) If the Sellers Representative disputes the accuracy of the calculation
of Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash or Actual Indebtedness, the Sellers
Representative shall provide written notice to Purchaser no later than thirty
(30) days following the delivery by Purchaser to the Sellers Representative
of the calculation of Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash and Actual
Indebtedness (the " _Dispute Notice_ "), setting forth those items that the
Sellers Representative disputes. During the thirty (30) day period following
delivery of a Dispute Notice, Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall
negotiate in good faith with a view to resolving their disagreements over the
disputed items. During such thirty (30) day period and until the final
determination of Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash and/or Actual
Indebtedness in accordance with this _Section 2.10(c)(ii)_ or _Section
2.10(c)(iii)_, as the case may be, (as so determined, or as determined
pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)(i)_ above, " _Final Working Capital_ ," "
_Final Cash_ ," and " _Final Indebtedness_ ," respectively), the Sellers
Representative and its agents shall be provided with such access to the
financial books and records of Purchaser and the Company Group as it may
reasonably request. If the parties resolve their differences over the disputed
items in accordance with the foregoing procedure, Final Working Capital, Final
Cash and Final Indebtedness shall be the amounts agreed upon by them. If the
parties fail to resolve their differences over the disputed items within such
thirty (30) day period, then Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall
forthwith jointly request that KPMG LLP (the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ ")
make a binding determination as to the disputed items in accordance with this
Agreement.

(iii) The Accounting Arbitrator will under the terms of its engagement have
no more than thirty (30) days from the date of referral and no more than ten
(10) Business Days from the final submission of information and testimony by
Purchaser and the Sellers Representative within which to render its written
decision with respect to the disputed items (and only with respect to any
unresolved disputed items set forth in the Dispute Notice) and the final
calculation of Actual Working Capital, Actual Cash and Actual Indebtedness
shall be based solely on the resolution of such disputed items. The Accounting
Arbitrator shall review such submissions and base its determination solely on
such submissions. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Arbitrator
may not assign a value to any item greater than the maximum value for such
item claimed by either party or less than the minimum value for such item
claimed by either party. The decision of the Accounting Arbitrator shall
be deemed final and binding upon the parties and enforceable by any court of
competent jurisdiction and the Accounting Arbitrators final calculation of
Actual Working Capital shall be deemed the " _Final Working Capital_ ,"
the Accounting Arbitrators final calculation of Actual Cash shall be deemed
the " _Final Cash_ " and the Accounting Arbitrators final calculation of
Actual Indebtedness shall be deemed the " _Final Indebtedness_." The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator

 



19 Confidential

 



 

 shall be allocated to be paid by Purchaser, on the one hand, and each of the
Company Stockholders, severally and not jointly, in proportion to the
applicable percentage set forth on the attached " _Sellers Holdings Schedule_
" (the " _Applicable Percentage_ "), on the other, based upon the percentage
that the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to
the amount actually contested by such party, as determined by the Accounting
Arbitrator.

(d) Payment following Calculation of Final Working Capital, Final Cash and
Final Indebtedness.

(i) Following the determination of Final Working Capital, Final Cash and Final
Indebtedness, the Aggregate Initial Consideration shall be recalculated by
substituting the Final Working Capital for the Estimated Working Capital in
_Section 1.1_, the Final Cash for the Estimated Cash in _Section 1.1_, and
the Final Indebtedness for the Estimated Indebtedness in _Section 1.1_ (the
" _Adjusted Aggregate Initial Consideration_ ") and if (after taking into
account any Upward Closing Working Capital Adjustment or Downward Closing
Working Capital Adjustment at the Closing) (A) the Adjusted Aggregate Initial
Consideration is greater than the Aggregate Initial Consideration on the
Closing Date, then such difference shall be paid by Purchaser to the Sellers
Representative (for the benefit of each of the Company Stockholders in
accordance with such Persons Applicable Percentage); and (B) the Aggregate
Initial Consideration on the Closing Date is greater than the Adjusted
Aggregate Initial Consideration, then the Sellers Representative and
Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay from the Escrow Fund
the absolute value of such difference, in immediately available funds to
Purchaser by wire transfer to the bank account designated in writing
by Purchaser (provided that such amount paid pursuant to this clause (B)
shall not exceed the amount of the Escrow Fund). In the event that the full
amount (if any) by which the Aggregate Initial Consideration on the Closing
Date exceeds the Adjusted Aggregate Initial Consideration is greater than the
Escrow Fund, Purchaser shall have no recourse against the Sellers
Representative, the Company Stockholders or any other Person.

 

(ii) All payments pursuant to this _Section 2.10(d)_ shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in advance
by the Sellers Representative or Purchaser, as applicable, and all such
payments and releases from the Escrow Fund, as applicable, shall be made on or
prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day following: (A) the thirty (30) day
period following Purchasers delivery of the calculation of the Actual Working
Capital, Actual Cash and Actual Indebtedness pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_
if the Sellers Representative does not timely dispute either of such amounts
pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)(i)_; (B) the date of the Sellers
Representatives and Purchasers mutual determination of Final Working
Capital, Final Cash and Final Indebtedness in the event the Sellers
Representative timely disputes either of such amounts pursuant to _Section
2.10(c)(i)_ and the Sellers Representatives and Purchasers differences are
resolved without the engagement of an Accounting Arbitrator pursuant to
_Section 2.10(c)(ii)_; and (C) the date of the Accounting Arbitrators
determination of Final Working Capital, Final Cash and/or Final Indebtedness
pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)(iii)_ in the event the Sellers Representative
timely disputes either of such amounts pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)(i)_ and
the Sellers Representative and Purchaser are unable to resolve their
differences pursuant to _Section 2.10(c)(iii)_.

Company Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time

the Merger and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such
shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "
_Dissenting Stock_ ") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to
receive, any portion of the Aggregate Initial Consideration or Final Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Such holders
of Company Stock shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value
of such shares of Company Stock held by them in accordance with the provisions
of such Section 262, except that all Dissenting Stock held by the holders of
Company Stock who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under such Section
262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive any portion
of the Aggregate Initial Consideration and Final Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, without any interest thereon, upon
surrender, in the manner provided herein, of the Certificate or Certificates
that formerly evidenced such shares or the execution and delivery of a lost

(b) The Company shall give (i) Purchaser and the Sellers Representative
prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the Sellers Representative the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company Stockholders shall be
responsible pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ for the excess, if any, of all
reasonable third-party out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) related to, arising out of, or incurred in
connection with, the Companys negotiations or proceedings relating to any
demand for payment of Dissenting Stock, including any payment required to be
made to any holder of Dissenting Stock with respect to the settlement or
resolution of any appraisal proceeding relating thereto in excess of the
aggregate amount of consideration that would have otherwise been payable with
respect to such Dissenting Stock (such excess, being referred to as the "
_Excess Dissenters Costs_ ").

2.12 _Additional Payment_. The parties hereby agree that the Company
Stockholders shall be entitled to receive from Purchaser as additional
consideration following the Closing a payment in cash in the amount of
$15,000,000 (the " _Additional Payment_ ") in the event that, at any time on
or prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, any member of the Company Group)
enters into an agreement or agreements with respect to a transaction or series
of related transactions to acquire all or a majority of the business of
Suntree, LLC and its Affiliates (collectively, " _Suntree_ "), whether by
purchase, lease or license of all or a majority of the assets of Suntree,
purchase of a majority of the outstanding equity interests of Suntree
(including by means of merger, recapitalization, consolidation,
reorganization, combination or otherwise), or any other transaction pursuant
to which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates obtains control of all or a
majority of Suntree or its business (collectively, a " _Suntree Acquisition_
"). Purchaser shall make (or shall cause to be made) the Additional Payment to

cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds (to an account or
accounts designated in advance in writing by the Sellers Representative to
Purchaser)

 within five (5) Business Days following the closing of a Suntree
Acquisition. The further payment of the Additional Payment to the Company
Stockholders by the Sellers Representative shall be net of any amounts
payable to Chestnut Hill Partners in respect of the Suntree Acquisition, which
amounts shall be paid by the Sellers Representative out of the Additional
Payment. Any Additional Payment under this  _Section 2.12_ shall be treated
by all parties as an adjustment to the Final Merger Consideration for all
purposes, including for Tax purposes.

 

2.13 _Withholding_. Purchaser, the Company Group, and the Paying Agent will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from (i) any amount payable pursuant to this
Agreement (including payments of the Final Merger Consideration and releases
of the Escrow Funds) and (ii) any amount attributable to the Restricted Shares
and payable pursuant to the Restricted Shares purchase agreements, in each
case, such amounts as Purchaser, the Company Group, or the Paying Agent (or
any Affiliate thereof) shall determine in good faith they are required by Law
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code or any other provision of applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ ,
except with respect to payments in the nature of compensation to be made to
employees or former employees, Purchaser, the Company Group or the Paying
Agent shall provide the Sellers Representative with a written notice of such
payors intention to withhold at least three (3) Business Days prior to any
such withholding and each of the parties hereto shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize any such Taxes. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Purchaser, the Company Group, or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding
were made. Any payments to the Company Stockholders treated as compensation
shall be forwarded to the Company and paid to the Company Stockholders through
the Companys payroll.

7.3 _Indemnification Procedure_.

 

(a) If, subsequent to the Closing, any Person entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") asserts a claim for
indemnification for or receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any
Third Party Claim as to which such Indemnified Party intends to seek
indemnification under this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall
give reasonably prompt written notice of such claim to the party from whom
indemnification is to be sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), together with a
statement of any available information regarding such claim. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party (the
" _Defense Notice_ ") within fifteen (15) days after receipt from the
Indemnified Party of notice of such claim, by which notice the Indemnifying
Party shall specify the counsel it will appoint to defend such claim ("
_Defense Counsel_ "), to conduct at its expense the defense against such Third
Party Claim in its own name, or if necessary in the name of the Indemnified
Party;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to approve the Defense Counsel, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Indemnified Party is
a Purchaser Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party shall, upon
verification to the Indemnified Party in writing that, subject in each case to
the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this _Article 7_ , such
Indemnifying Party (A) shall be responsible (with no reservation of any
rights) for any Adverse Consequences related to such Third Party Claim, and
(B) shall provide full indemnification to the Indemnified Party with respect
to such Third Party Claim (an " _Acknowledgment_ "), be entitled to fund the
defense of such Third Party Claim from the Escrow Fund and the Purchaser and
the Seller Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
reimburse the expenses of such Indemnifying Party as and promptly when
notified by such Indemnifying Party that such reimbursement is being sought.
The Parties agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the
defense, negotiation or settlement of any Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party delivers a Defense Notice to the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party will cooperate with and make available to the Indemnifying
Party such assistance and materials as may be reasonably requested by
the Indemnifying Party, all at the expense of the Indemnifying Party (subject
to the final proviso of the preceding sentence).

(b) If the Indemnifying Party shall fail to give a Defense Notice, it shall
be deemed to have elected not to conduct the defense of the subject Third
Party Claim, and in such event the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
conduct such defense in good faith. If the Indemnified Party defends any
Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified
Party for the costs and expenses of defending such Third Party Claim upon
submission of periodic bills. If the Indemnifying Party elects to conduct the
defense of the subject Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may
participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Third Party
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party (i) if so requested by the Indemnifying Party to
participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified
Party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate representation
advisable; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not
be required to pay for more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in
connection with any Third Party Claim; _provided_ that such reimbursement
shall come from the Escrow Fund in the event that such Indemnified Party is a
Purchaser Indemnified Party, subject to delivery of an Acknowledgement that
the relevant Third Party Claim is one for which the Company Stockholders are
liable to indemnify such Purchaser Indemnified Party.

 



53 Confidential

 



 

(c) Regardless of which Party defends a Third Party Claim, the other Party
shall have the right at its expense to participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim, assisted by counsel of its own choosing. The Indemnified
Party shall not compromise, settle, default on, or admit liability with
respect to a Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. The Indemnifying Party shall not compromise or settle a Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(d) Subject to the other terms of this _Article 7_ and the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, once all disputes concerning the Indemnifying Partys
indemnification obligations as to a particular claim or amount has been
resolved by a final decision, judgment or award rendered by a Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in which to
appeal therefrom, or the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to an
indemnification claim hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall be required to
pay all indemnification amounts so due and owing to the Indemnified Party by
wire transfer of immediately available funds within ten (10) Business Days
after the date of such notice (which, in the case of the Company
Stockholders being the Indemnifying Party, such amounts being paid solely
from and limited by the amounts then being held in the Escrow Fund).

(e) To the extent there is an inconsistency between this _Section 7.3_ and
_Section 9.7_ as to any Tax matter, _Section 9.7_ shall govern and control.

 

7.4 _Direct Claims_. It is the intent of the parties that all direct claims by
an Indemnified Party against a party not arising out of Third Party Claims
shall be subject to and benefit from the terms of this _Article 7_. Any claim
under this _Article 7_ by an Indemnified Party for indemnification other than
indemnification against a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") will be
asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice
thereof, and the Indemnifying Party will have a period of twenty (20) days
within which to satisfy such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not
so respond within such twenty (20) day period, the Indemnifying Party will be
deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event the Indemnified Party will
be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified
Party under this _Article 7_.

7.5 _Failure to Give Timely Notice_. A failure by an Indemnified Party to give
timely, complete, or accurate notice as provided in _Sections 7.7_ or _7.4_
shall not affect the rights or obligations of any party hereunder except to
the extent that, as a result of such failure, any party entitled to receive
such notice was deprived of its right to recover any payment under its
applicable insurance coverage or was otherwise adversely affected or damaged
as a result of such failure to give timely, complete, and accurate notice.

 

7.6 _Reduction of Adverse Consequences_.

 

(a) Any Adverse Consequences of an Indemnified Party shall be reduced by
receipt of applicable payment under insurance policies or from third parties
(net of the expenses of the recovery thereof) not affiliated with the
Indemnified Party. If indemnification payments shall have been received prior
to the collection of such proceeds, the Indemnified Party shall remit to the
Indemnifying Party the amount of such proceeds (net of the cost of collection
thereof) to the extent of indemnification payments received in respect of such
Adverse Consequences. The parties shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to collect the proceeds of any insurance that would have the effect
of reducing any Adverse Consequences.

 



54 Confidential

 



 

(b) Any Adverse Consequences of an Indemnified party shall be reduced by any
Tax benefit that the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates actually
realizes as a result of the event giving rise to indemnification in the year
in which such Adverse Consequence is incurred, in any prior taxable year or in
either of the two (2) succeeding taxable years. If indemnification payments
shall have been received prior to the realization of such Tax benefit, the
Indemnified Party shall remit to the Indemnifying Party, within thirty (30)
days of the filing of the Tax Return on which such Tax benefit is actually
realized, the amount of such Tax benefit. The parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to realize any Tax benefit that would have the
effect of reducing any Adverse Consequences. For purposes of this  _Section
7.6(b)_, a Tax benefit shall equal the actual reduction in income Taxes
payable by the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates on their Tax returns and
shall be computed by comparing the income Taxes the Indemnified Party and
its Affiliates paid for such taxable year with the amount of income Taxes the
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates would have paid if the event giving rise
to indemnification had not occurred.

 

(c) The parties acknowledge that any right to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article 7_ shall be subject to any duty to mitigate Adverse Consequences

 be done in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

its reasonable discretion (the " _Sellers  Representative Expense Fund_") to
be held in trust to cover and reimburse the fees and expenses incurred by the
Sellers Representative for its obligations in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated herein. Any balance of the Sellers
Representative Expense Fund not incurred for such purposes shall be returned

the transactions contemplated hereby and that Sellers Counsel has not acted
as counsel for any other Person in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and that no other party or Person has the status of a

event that a dispute arises between Purchaser, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates and Sellers Representative or any of its Affiliates,
Sellers Counsel may represent Sellers Representative or any of its
Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of Sellers

60 Confidential

 



 

 adverse to Purchaser, any member of the Company Group or any of their
respective Affiliates and even though Sellers Counsel may have represented a
member of the Company Group in a matter substantially related to such
dispute, and Purchaser, the Company and their respective Affiliates hereby
waive, on behalf of themselves and each of their Affiliates, any conflict of
interest in connection with such representation by Sellers Counsel. Each of
Purchaser and the Company further agrees that, as to all pre-Closing
communications among Sellers Counsel, any member of the Company Group
(including its officers, directors, employees and agents), and any Company
Stockholder that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence
and all other rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to Sellers
Representative and its Affiliates, as applicable, and may be controlled by
Sellers Representative and its Affiliates and shall not pass to or be claimed
by Purchaser, the Company Group or any of their respective Affiliates.
Purchaser and the Company agree to take, and to cause their respective
Affiliates to take, all steps necessary to implement the intent of this
_Section 9.5(e)_.

9.6  _Directors and Officers Insurance_. After the Closing, Purchaser shall
continue to provide any Person who is on the date hereof, or who becomes prior
to the Closing Date, an officer, director or manager of any member of the
Company Group (each such Person, a " _D andO Beneficiary_"), officers and

all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened action,
suit, claim, proceeding or investigation (each, a " _D andO Claim_") to the
extent that any such DandO Claim is based on, or arises out of the fact that
such DandO Beneficiary is or was a manager, director or officer of any member of
the Company Group at any time prior to the Closing Date or is or was serving
at the request of any member of the Company Group as a manager, director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, limited liability company,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise at any time prior to the
Closing Date, to the extent that any such Claim pertains to any matter or
fact arising, existing, or occurring prior to or at the Closing Date,
regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Closing Date, which coverage will be substantially similar to the
existing DandO Insurance of the Company Group, a copy of which has been made
available to Purchasers counsel, including, without limitation, (x) an
overall coverage amount equal to the overall coverage amount under the
existing DandO Insurance of the Company Group and (y) coverage for liability
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in an amount equal to the
coverage amounts for such liabilities under the existing DandO Insurance of the
Company Group;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the premiums payable for such
DandO Insurance shall not exceed $150,000 and in the event such premiums do
exceed $150,000 Purchaser shall or shall cause the Company Group to purchase
such insurance up to the amount that can be purchased with a premium of
$150,000. For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Purchaser shall
not, and shall not permit any member of the Company Group (including the
Surviving Corporation) to, amend, repeal or modify (in a manner adverse to
the beneficiary thereof) any provision in such Persons certificates of
incorporation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement or comparable
governing documents relating to the exculpation or indemnification of, or
advancement of expenses to, any officers, directors or managers, it being the
intent of the parties hereto that the officers, directors and managers of the
Company Group on the date hereof shall continue to be entitled to such
exculpation, indemnification and advancement to the full extent of the Law.
The provisions of this _Section 9.6_ are intended to be for the benefit of,
and enforceable by, each DandO Beneficiary and such Persons estate, heirs
and representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
pursuant to Law, the organizational documents of any member of the Company
Group, contract or otherwise.

9.7 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The Sellers Representative, at the Company Stockholders sole cost and
expense, shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and shall timely file, or
cause to be filed, all income Tax Returns of the Company Group for all Pre-
Closing Tax Periods, whether to be filed before, on or after the Closing Date
(" _Company Stockholder Tax Returns_ "). Unless otherwise required by
applicable Law, such Company Stockholder Tax Returns shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with existing procedures and practices and accounting
methods. At least ten (10) days prior to the due date of any Company
Stockholder Tax Return due after the Closing Date, the Sellers
Representative shall submit such Company Stockholder Tax Return to Purchaser
for Purchasers review and comment and Purchaser shall cause the applicable
member of the Company Group to sign and timely file the Company Stockholder
Tax Returns. The Sellers Representative shall provide a detailed schedule of
the Transaction Tax Deductions claimed on the Companys IRS Form 1120 (and the
amount of net operating loss carry forward that is attributable to such
Transaction Tax Deductions) for the taxable year ended on the Closing Date
when it is submitted to Purchaser for Purchasers review and comment (and upon
the reasonable request of Purchaser, shall provide any information with
respect to such deductions, including any work papers and other support for
claiming any purported Transaction Tax Deductions). To the extent Purchaser
disputes the amount or validity of such Transaction Tax Deductions claimed
or other material item on a Company Stockholders Tax Return, the Sellers
Representative and Purchaser shall consult in good faith to resolve their
differences. If the parties cannot resolve their differences as to the any
purported Transaction Tax Deductions or other material item on a Company
Stockholder Tax Return, then the parties shall retain the Accounting
Arbitrator to promptly resolve their dispute. The decision of the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties. The fees and expenses
of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser,
on the one hand, and fifty percent (50%) by the Company Stockholders, on the
other hand.

 

(b) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns (other than the Company Stockholder Tax Returns) of the
Company Group and the Surviving Corporation which are due after the Closing
Date (" _Purchaser Tax Returns_ "). To the extent that Purchaser intends to
file or cause the Company Group or the Surviving Corporation to file a
Purchaser Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period that is
inconsistent with past practices, procedures or accounting methods or shows an
Indemnified Tax, no later than forty-five (45) days prior to filing any such
Tax Return, Purchaser shall submit such Tax Return to the Sellers
Representative for its review and comment. To the extent Sellers
Representative disputes the validity of any such Purchaser Tax Return, the
Sellers Representative and Purchaser shall consult in good faith to resolve
their differences. If the parties cannot resolve their differences with
respect to any Purchaser Tax Return, then the parties shall retain the
Accounting Arbitrator to promptly resolve their dispute. The decision of the
Accounting Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties. The fees
and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by
Purchaser, on the one hand, and fifty percent (50%) by the Company
Stockholders, on the other hand. Purchaser shall make any revisions as are
reasonably requested by Sellers Representative. The parties hereto agree that
any Tax Return that includes the Closing Date shall include, to the
extent allowable by applicable Law, all Transaction Tax Deductions. No
failure or delay of Purchaser in providing

 



62 Confidential

 



 

 such Tax Returns for the Sellers Representative to review shall relieve or
otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of the Company Stockholders
pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent the Company Stockholders are
actually prejudiced by such failure or delay.

(c) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law or pursuant to _Section
9.7(i)_, Purchaser and its Affiliates (including on or after the Closing Date,
the Company Group or the Surviving Corporation) shall not file, or cause to be
filed, any restatement or amendment of, modification to, or claim for refund
relating to, any Tax Return of any member of the Company Group for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period without the prior written consent of
the Sellers Representative.

 

(d) For purposes of determining the amount of Taxes that relate to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (or portion of any Straddle Period ending on or prior to
the Closing Date) the parties agree as follows:

(i) In the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis, the amount that is attributable to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined by multiplying the Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire Straddle Period.

 

(ii) In the case of all other Taxes (including income Taxes, employment Taxes,
and sales and use Taxes) the amount that is attributable to the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined as if the
Company Group or the Surviving Corporation filed a separate Tax Return with
respect to such Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending as of the
end of the day on the Closing Date using a "closing of the books methodology."
For purposes of clause (ii), any item determined on an annual or periodic
basis (including amortization and depreciation deductions and the effects of
graduated rates) shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date based on the mechanics set forth in clause (i) for
periodic Taxes.

 

(iii) All Taxes in the form of interest or penalties that relate to Taxes for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion of any Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date) shall be treated as occurring in a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date) whether such
items are incurred, accrued, assessed or similarly charged on, before or
after the Closing Date.

(iv) For purposes of determining Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, any year
of a Flow-Thru Entity that includes the Closing Date shall be considered to
close as of the end of the Closing Date irrespective of whether such Flow-Thru
Entitys tax year actually ends on such date.

 

(e) _Cooperation; Procedures Relating to Tax Claims_.

 

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 9.7_, Purchaser and the
Sellers Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested, in connection with (i) the filing of Tax Returns of the
Company Group or the Surviving Corporation, (ii) any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes and Tax 

 



63 Confidential

 



 

 Returns of the Company Group or the Surviving Corporation and (iii) the
preparation of any financial statements to the extent related to Taxes of the
Company Group or the Surviving Corporation. Such cooperation shall include
the retention, and (upon the other partys request) the provision, of records
and information of the Company Group or the Surviving Corporation which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder;
_provided_ , that the party requesting assistance shall pay the reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the party providing such assistance;
_provided_ , _further_ , no party shall be required to provide assistance at
times or in amounts that would interfere unreasonably with the business
and operations of such party.

(ii) Purchaser shall provide the Sellers Representative with notice of any
written inquiries, audits, examinations or proposed adjustments by the
Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority, which relate to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period within ten (10) days of the
receipt of such notice. No failure or delay of Purchaser in the performance
of the foregoing shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligations or
liabilities of the Company Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement, except to
the extent the Company Stockholders are actually prejudiced by such failure
or delay.

(iii) The Surviving Corporation shall control the conduct of any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes and Tax Returns of the
Company Group (" _Tax Contest_ "); provided, however, (w) the Sellers
Representative shall have the right to participate in any such Tax Contest to
the extent such Tax Contest relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period, (x) the Surviving Corporation shall keep the Sellers Representative
reasonably informed of the status of such matter (including providing the
Sellers Representative with drafts of all written correspondence regarding
such matter (and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
drafts) and final copies of all such written correspondence), (y) to the
extent there is an election or other decision as to whether to pay or not pay
an Indemnified Tax as part of a dispute of any Tax Contest, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain the consent of the Sellers Representative (which
will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned) prior to paying
the Indemnified Tax as part of the dispute, and (z) shall not settle any Tax
Contest that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period without
the Sellers Representatives consent (which will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed, or conditioned).

(f) No party hereto nor any Affiliate thereof shall make an election
under Section 338 of the Code or Section 336 of the Code or any similar
provision of foreign, state or local Law in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(g) The Purchaser shall not take any action or cause any action to be taken
with respect to the Company Group or the Surviving Corporation subsequent to
the Closing that would cause the transactions contemplated hereby to
constitute part of a transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar
to, the " _Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter_ " described in
Internal Revenue Service Notice 2001-16, 2001-1 C.B. 730, and Internal
Revenue Service Notice 2008-20 I.R.B. 2008-6 (January 17, 2008), and Internal
Revenue Service Notice 2008-111 I.R.B. 1299 (December 1, 2008).

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and all
conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_
") shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by the Company Stockholders and fifty
percent (50%) by the Purchaser when due.

 

(i) Subject to the penultimate sentence of this _Section 9.7(i)_, Tax refunds
(other than Tax refunds for Transfer Taxes, which shall be allocated in the
same manner as Transfer Taxes are allocated under _Section 9.7(h)_) (whether
payable in cash or a direct credit against Taxes otherwise payable) of any
member of the Company Group that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or
portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date as determined in
accordance with the same principles provided for in _Section 9.7(d)_), shall
be for the benefit of the Company Stockholders. To the extent that Purchaser,
any member of the Company Group, or the Surviving Corporation receives a Tax
refund that is for the benefit of the Company Stockholders, Purchaser shall
pay over to the Sellers Representative for distribution to the Company
Stockholders any such Tax refund (without interest other than interest
received from the Governmental Authority), net of any Taxes and any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses that Purchaser, any member of the Company Group, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates incur (or has or will incur)
with respect to such refund (and related interest) within ten (10) days after
receipt of the Tax refund from the applicable Governmental Authority (or, if
the refund is in the form of a direct credit, ten (10) days after filing the
Tax Return claiming such credit). Purchaser shall cooperate with the Sellers
Representative in obtaining such refunds, including through the filing of
amended Tax Returns or refund claims, it being understood that (i) Purchaser
shall not, and shall cause the Company Group to not, waive any carryback of
net operating loss or other Tax attribute of any member of the Company Group
generated or otherwise attributable to a taxable period ending on or before
or including the Closing Date if such waiver would reduce the amount due to
Sellers Representative for the benefit of the Company Stockholders pursuant
to this _Section 9.7(i)_, (ii) Purchaser and the Company Group
will carryback any net operating losses for taxable periods ending on or
before or including the Closing Date to prior taxable periods as allowable by
applicable Tax Law and shall claim Tax refunds as a result of such carryback
(including through the filing of amended Tax Returns), (iii) unless otherwise
agreed to by the Sellers Representative and Purchaser, such Tax refunds will
be claimed in cash rather than as a credit against future Tax liabilities, and
(iv) Purchaser and the Company Group shall cooperate with the Sellers
Representative in preparing and promptly filing Tax Returns (including
amendments of prior Tax Returns and claims for Tax refunds, including filing
IRS Forms 1139 and/or 4466 for any taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date and any Straddle Periods). No refund (whether in the form of cash
received or a direct credit against Taxes) shall be payable to the Company
Stockholders under this _Section 9.7(i)_ (and such refunds shall be for the
benefit of Purchaser, the Company Group and the Surviving Corporation) to the
extent (A) any Tax refund results from the carryback of any net operating loss
or other Tax attribute or credit realized in a period that is not a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (or portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date); (B) any Tax refund is reflected as a current asset (or offset to a
current liability) on the Final Working Capital; (C) any Tax refund gives rise
to a payment obligation by any member of the Company Group or Surviving
Corporation to a Person under applicable Law or pursuant to a Contract or
other agreement entered (or assumed) on or prior to the Closing Date; or (D)
any Tax refund relates to Taxes paid after the Closing Date that were not
indemnified or actually paid by the Company Stockholders. For purposes of this
_Section 9.7(i)_, to the extent the Estimated Closing Income 

 



65 Confidential

 



 

 Taxes exceed the actual income Taxes of the Company Group paid after the
Closing Date for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or the portion of a Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date), such excess shall constitute a Tax refund
for purposes of this _Section 9.7(i)_ and be payable for the benefit of the
Company Stockholders ten (10) days after filing the final relevant income Tax
Return of the Company and the amount included in Estimated Closing Income
Taxes shall be reduced by the amount of such payment.

(j) To the extent that any Tax Benefit is realized by Purchaser, the Company
Group or the Surviving Corporation (collectively, the " _Purchaser Group_ ")
with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to
December 31, 2016 and beginning after the Closing Date, within thirty (30)
days of actually realizing (as described below) such Tax Benefit, the
Purchaser Group shall pay the amount of any such Tax Benefit to the Sellers
Representative (for the benefit of the Company Stockholders). For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean any actual reduction in the
Purchaser Groups cumulative liability for income Taxes with respect to any
Post-Closing Tax Period (or the portion of any Straddle Period beginning
after the Closing Date) resulting from a Transaction Tax Deduction (including
a net operating loss carryforward that would not have been available but for a
Transaction Tax Deduction). A Tax Benefit shall be deemed to be realized in
a Post-Closing Tax Period (or the portion of any Straddle Period beginning
after the Closing Date) if, and to the extent that the Purchaser Groups
cumulative liability for income Taxes for such Post-Closing Tax Period (or the
portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date), calculated
by excluding the relevant Transaction Tax Deduction, exceeds Purchaser Groups
actual liability for income Taxes for such Post-Closing Tax Period, calculated
by taking into account the relevant Transaction Tax Deduction. A Tax Benefit
shall be deemed to be realized at the time the relevant income Tax Return with
respect to the Post-Closing Tax Period (or the portion of any Straddle Period
beginning after the Closing Date) in which the Tax Benefit is realized is
filed (but no later than the due date (taking into account all appropriate
extensions) for such relevant income Tax Return).

 

(k) Other than with respect to _Section 9.7(j)_, the Company Stockholders
rights, and Purchasers and its Affiliates covenants and other obligations
(including the obligation to make any payment under this _Section 9.7_ or to
take or refrain from taking any actions under this _Section 9.7_), under this
_Section 9.7_ shall expire on the first anniversary of the Closing Date.

10.3 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any
rights, benefits or obligations set forth herein may be assigned by any of the
parties hereto without the prior written consent of Purchaser and
the Sellers Representative, any attempted assignment without such prior
written consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, Purchaser
may, without the consent of the other parties hereto (i) assign its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, if such subsidiary delivers to the Sellers Representative an

 instrument in writing that it is bound by and shall perform the obligations
of Purchaser under this Agreement as if it were an original signatory hereto
or (ii) assign its rights or interests under this Agreement as collateral to
any financial or lending institution providing financing to Purchaser in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder; _provided_ , that, in
each case, no such assignment shall release Purchaser from any of its
obligations hereunder. In the event of an assignment contemplated by this
_Section 10.3_, any reference in this Agreement to "Purchaser" shall be
deemed to include its subsidiary transferee.

 

10.4 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable Law, such provision will be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

10.5 _No Strict Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and the parties intend that no rule of strict construction will be
applied against any Person. The use of the word " _including_ " in
this Agreement or in any of the agreements contemplated hereby shall be by
way of example rather than by limitation. Unless the context otherwise
requires, any reference to a " _Section_ ," " _Exhibit_ ," or " _Schedule_ "
shall be deemed to refer to a section of this Agreement, exhibit to this
Agreement or a schedule to this Agreement, as applicable. The words " _hereof_
," " _herein_ " and " _hereunder_ " and words of similar import referring to
this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement.

 

10.6 _Captions_. The captions used in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not
be deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this
Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced and
construed as if no caption had been used in this Agreement.

 

10.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth
in this Agreement (including as set forth in  _Section 9.6_ above), nothing
herein expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to confer upon
or give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason
of this Agreement, such third parties specifically including employees or
creditors of the Company Group.

10.8  _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that
the rights of each party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
are unique and recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of this
Agreement by any party, money damages would be inadequate and the non-
breaching party would have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the parties
agree that such non-breaching party shall have the right, in addition to any
other rights and remedies existing in their favor at law or in equity, to
enforce their rights and the other partys obligations hereunder not only by
an action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions for specific
performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without posting of
bond or other security).

10.9 _Complete Agreement_. This document and the documents referred to herein
contain the complete agreement between the parties and supersede any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or between the parties,
written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any

10.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, any one of which may be by facsimile, and all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

10.11 _Governing Law and Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware. To the extent permitted by Law, each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any state court sitting in the
State of Delaware or United States federal court sitting in Wilmington,
Delaware, over any suit, action or other proceeding brought by any party
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims with respect to any such suit,
action or other proceeding shall be heard and determined in such courts. In
the event of any litigation regarding or arising from this Agreement, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party
its reasonable expenses, attorneys fees and costs incurred therein or in
enforcement or collection of any judgment or award rendered therein.

 

10.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.
