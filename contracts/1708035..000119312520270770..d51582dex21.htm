Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) and its and their respective
employees, accountants and other Representatives directly involved in the

and assist Parent and its Representatives in connection with such review,

(c) Purchaser agrees that, following the Closing through the date that the

the Initial Closing Statement is based, or on which the Final
Closing Statement is to be based, that would impede or delay the
determination of the amount of the Working Capital Adjustment Amount, the

Transaction Expense Amount or the preparation of any Notice of Disagreement
or the Final Closing Statement in the manner and utilizing the methods
provided by this Agreement.

 

Section 2.6 _Reconciliation of Initial Closing Statement_.

 

(a) Parent shall notify Purchaser in writing no later than forty-five (45)
days after Parents receipt of the Initial Closing Statement if Parent
disagrees with the Initial Closing Statement, which notice shall describe the
specific items of disagreement and the specific basis therefor (the " _Notice
of Disagreement_ "). If no Notice of Disagreement is delivered to Purchaser
within such forty-five (45) day period, then the Initial Closing Statement
shall become final and binding upon the parties in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.6(c)_. If a Notice of Disagreement is delivered to Purchaser within
such forty-five (45) day period, then only such portions of the Initial
Closing Statement that Parent does not identify or disagree with in the Notice
of Disagreement shall become final and binding upon the parties in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.6(c)_.

(b) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of
a Notice of Disagreement (the " _Resolution Period_ "), Parent and Purchaser
shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any differences that they may have
with respect to the matters identified in the Notice of Disagreement.

 



-21- 

    

(c) If, at the end of the Resolution Period, Parent and Purchaser have been
unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters identified in the Notice of Disagreement, Parent and Purchaser shall
submit all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the Notice of
Disagreement to the dispute resolution group of Grant Thornton LLP or, if
such firm is unwilling or unable to fulfill such role, (i) another independent
certified public accounting firm in the United States of national reputation
mutually acceptable to Parent and Purchaser, or (ii) if Parent and Purchaser
are unable to agree upon another such firm within ten (10) Business Days after
the end of the Resolution Period, then within an additional ten (10) Business
Days, Parent and Purchaser shall each select one such firm and those two
firms shall, within ten (10) Business Days after their selection, select a
third (3rd) such firm (the firm selected in accordance with _clause_ __ _ (_
_i_ _)_ or the third firm selected in accordance with _clause_ __ _ (ii)_,
as applicable, the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). Within thirty (30) days
after the Independent Accounting Firms selection, the Independent
Accounting Firm shall make a final determination in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and the definitions contained in this Agreement and
based solely on a single written submissions of the parties (which written
submissions must be concurrently provided to the other party) and not an
independent review, binding on the parties to this Agreement, of the
appropriate amount of each of the matters that remain in dispute solely to the
extent indicated in the Notice of Disagreement that Parent and Purchaser have
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm. With respect to each disputed
matter, such determination, if not in accordance with the position of either
Parent or Purchaser, shall not be in excess of the higher, or less than
the lower, of the amounts advocated by Parent in the Notice of Disagreement
or by Purchaser in the Initial Closing Statement with respect to such disputed
matter. For the avoidance of doubt, the Independent Accounting Firm shall not
review or make any determination with respect to any matter other than the
matters that remain in dispute to the extent indicated in the Notice of
Disagreement and shall not consider any events or developments that occurred
after the Closing. The Initial Closing Statement as finally determined either
through agreement of the parties pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(b)_ or through the action of the Independent Accounting
Firm pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.6(c)_, shall be the " _Final Closing
Statement_."

(d) All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne on a proportionate basis by
Parent, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, based on the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to such
Person bears to the amount actually contested. During the review by the
Independent Accounting Firm, each of Purchaser and Parent shall, and shall
cause its respective Subsidiaries (including, in the case of Purchaser, the
Transferred Entities) and its and their respective employees, accountants and
other Representatives to, each make available to the Independent Accounting
Firm interviews with such personnel, and such information, books and records
and work papers, as may be reasonably requested by the Independent Accounting
Firm to fulfill its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 2.6(c)_. In acting under
this Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm shall be entitled to the
privileges and immunities of an arbitrator, it being understood that in
acting under this Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator.

(e) The process set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ and this  _Section_ __ _
2.6_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of any of the parties and their
respective Affiliates for any disputes related to the Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, the Closing Cash Amount, the Closing Indebtedness Amount,
the Closing Transaction Expense Amount, the Post-Closing Adjustment, and the
calculations and amounts on which they are based or set forth in the related
statements and notices delivered in connection therewith, whether or not the
underlying facts and circumstances constitute a breach of any representations
or warranties contained in this Agreement.

Section 2.7  _Post-Closing Adjustment_. The " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ " may
be either a positive or negative amount, and shall be equal to (a) (i) the
Working Capital Adjustment Amount set forth in the Final Closing Statement, 
_minus_ (ii) the Working Capital Adjustment Amount set forth in the Estimated
Closing Statement, _plus_ (b) (i) the Closing Indebtedness Amount set forth in
the Estimated Closing Statement, _minus_ (ii) the Closing Indebtedness Amount
set forth in the Final Closing Statement, _plus_ (c) (i) the Closing Cash
Amount set forth in the Final Closing Statement, _minus_ (ii) the Closing Cash
Amount set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement,  _plus_ (d) (i) the
Closing Transaction Expense Amount set forth in the Estimated Closing
Statement, _minus_ (ii) the Closing Transaction Expense Amount set forth in
the Final Closing Statement. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive
amount, then Purchaser shall pay in cash to Parent (or one or more Affiliates
designated by Parent) the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-
Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then Parent (or an Affiliate
designated by Parent) shall pay in cash to Purchaser the absolute value of
the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment. The Closing Purchase Price, as
adjusted by the Post-Closing Adjustment, shall be the " _Final Purchase
Price_." Any such payment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days
after the determination of the Final Closing Statement to an account
designated in writing by the party entitled to such payment within three (3)

Section 5.6 _Financing_.

 

(a) As of the date hereof, Purchaser has delivered to Parent a true, complete
and correct copy of the fully executed debt commitment letter, together with
any related fee letters (in the case of the fee letters, redacted solely for
confidential provisions related to fees, "flex" terms and other economic
terms, none of which could adversely affect the
conditionality, enforceability, availability, termination or aggregate
principal amount of the Debt Financing to be funded for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case as contemplated by such Debt
Commitment Letters), dated as of the date of this Agreement, by and among the
Debt Financing Sources party thereto and Purchaser, providing for debt
financing as described therein (together with all exhibits, schedules and
annexes thereto, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Debt Financing
Sources party thereto have agreed to lend the amounts set forth therein (the "
_Debt Financing_ ").

 

(b) As of the date hereof, Purchaser has delivered to Parent a true, complete
and correct copy of the fully executed equity commitment letter dated as of
the date of this Agreement (together with all exhibits, schedules and annexes
thereto, the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Debt
Commitment Letter, the " _Commitment Letters_ "), by and between the
Purchaser Sponsor and Purchaser, pursuant to which the Purchaser Sponsor has
agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest in Purchaser
the amounts set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ " and, together with
the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). The Equity Commitment Letter
provides that Parent is an express third-party beneficiary of, and is entitled
to enforce, the Equity Commitment Letter.

 

(c) The Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and constitute the
valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Purchaser, and, to the Knowledge
of Purchaser, the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. There are no
conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt
Financing or Equity Financing, as applicable, other than the conditions
precedent expressly set forth in the applicable Commitment Letter. As of the
date hereof, the Commitment Letters have not been amended or modified in any
manner by Purchaser, or to the Knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties
thereto, and no such termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission is
contemplated by Purchaser, or to the Knowledge of Purchaser, any other party
thereto. As of the date hereof, and assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, (i)
Purchaser is not in default of or breach under the terms and conditions of any
of the Commitment Letters, and (ii) no event has occurred that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected
to constitute a default or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition on
behalf of Purchaser, or to the Knowledge of Purchaser, any other party
thereto, in each case, under the terms and conditions of any of the Commitment
Letters.

 



-45- 

    

(d) As of the date hereof, and assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, Purchaser has no
reason to believe that (i) any of the conditions precedent expressly set forth
in the Commitment Letters will not be satisfied on or prior to the Closing
Date or (ii) the Financing in the aggregate amounts contemplated by the
Commitment Letters will not be available to Purchaser on the Closing Date.
Purchaser acknowledges that Purchasers obligations under this Agreement are
not subject to any conditions regarding Purchasers, its Affiliates, or any
other Persons (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries) ability to obtain the Equity Financing or the Debt Financing for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) As of the date hereof, there are no side letters, understandings or
other agreements or arrangements of any kind relating to any of the
Commitment Letters or the Financing that could affect the availability of the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters, other than as expressly set
forth in the Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof, Purchaser or an
Affiliate of Purchaser on its behalf has fully paid any and all commitments or
other fees and amounts required by the Commitment Letters to be paid on or
prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

(f) The Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment Letters
(including after given effect to any "flex" provisions) and assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions to Purchasers obligations to consummate the
Sale (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
Closing), will provide Purchaser with cash proceeds on the Closing
Date sufficient to enable Purchaser to perform all of its obligations under
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including to deliver the Closing
Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price to Parent as and when contemplated
by this Agreement, pay any fees and expenses of or payable by Purchaser or
the Transferred Entities, and repay or refinance any outstanding indebtedness
of Purchaser and/or the Transferred Entities to the extent required in
connection with the transactions described in this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements or the Commitment Letters. Notwithstanding anything elsewhere in
this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the receipt or availability
of any funds or financing (including the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters) by or to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any other
financing transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Purchaser
hereunder.

 

(g) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, immediately after giving effect to the
consummation of the Sale, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
will be Solvent. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.6(g)_, " _Solvent_ "
shall mean, with respect to Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
that: (i) the fair saleable value (determined on a going concern basis) of the
assets of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall be greater
than the total amount of the liabilities of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (ii) Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall
be able to pay their debts and obligations in the Ordinary Course of Business
as they become due, and (iii) Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, shall have adequate capital to carry on their businesses.

Section 5.7  _Limited Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Purchaser Sponsor has delivered to Parent a true, complete and
correct copy of the executed Limited Guaranty. The Limited Guaranty is in full
force and effect and constitutes the valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of Purchaser Sponsor in favor of Parent, enforceable by Parent in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. The
Purchaser Sponsor is not in default of or breach under any of the terms or
conditions of the Limited Guaranty, and no event has occurred that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected
to constitute a default of or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition
under the terms and conditions of the Limited Guaranty. The Purchaser Sponsor
has access to sufficient capital to satisfy the full amount of the guaranteed
obligations under the Limited Guaranty in full.

local securities Law, and agrees that such Shares may not be sold,

disposed of without registration under the Securities Act, except pursuant to
an exemption from such registration available under the Securities Act, and in
compliance with any other federal, state, foreign or local securities Law, in
each case, to the extent applicable.

independent investigation, review and analysis of the business, operations,
assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition, technology,

-48- 

    

 thereof) or information (a) that may constitute privileged attorney-client
communications or attorney work product, (b) that is of a competitively
sensitive nature or (c) if the provision of access to such document (or
portion thereof) or information, as determined by the Parent, any Seller or
any Transferred Entity in good faith, could reasonably be expected to conflict

Parent, Sellers and the Transferred Entities will use their reasonable best
efforts to provide alternative means of disclosing such information to the
extent reasonably practicable). All information and documents
provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_ will be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement.

connection with Taxes or any potential Action or investigation by or before a
Governmental Entity (including in connection with the matters covered under 
_Section_ __ _ 6.11_) and SEC or other Governmental Entity reporting
obligations; _provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall limit any rights
of discovery of Parent or its Affiliates.

 

(d) Except for Tax Returns and other documents governed by _Section_ __ _
8.3(b)_, Purchaser agrees to hold, and to cause the applicable Transferred
Entities to hold, all the books and records of each Transferred Entity or the

portion thereof for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date or such
longer time as may be required by applicable Law, and thereafter, if any of

disposition to surrender them to Parent.

 other Contract between Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and

the Closing, independently derived by Parent or any of its Affiliates without
use of such Sensitive Business Information or (v) subject to the immediately
following sentence, that Parent or any of its Affiliates is required by Law or
required or requested pursuant to legal or regulatory process to disclose. In
the event that Parent or any of its Affiliates is required by Law or required

Purchaser in writing unless not permitted by Law or such legal or regulatory
process to so notify, which notification shall include the nature of such
legal or regulatory requirement or request, as applicable, and the extent of
the required or requested disclosure, and will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with Purchaser, at Purchasers expense, to preserve to
the extent reasonably practicable the confidentiality of such information. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit,
restrict, require prior notice with respect to, or in any other way affect
Parent or its Representatives communications with any Governmental Entity, or

transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement to
the extent exclusively relating to the Retained Business; _provided_ that the
foregoing restriction shall not apply to information (i) that becomes

Representatives from and after the Closing from a third-party source that is
not known by Purchaser or its applicable Representatives to be under
any obligations of confidentiality with respect to such information, (ii)
that is in the public domain or enters into the public domain through no fault
of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, (iii) to the extent used by Purchaser
or any of its Representatives to comply with the terms of this Agreement or

of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its Affiliates, on
the other hand, (iv) that is, following the Closing, independently derived by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates without use of such Sensitive Business
Information or (v) subject to the immediately following sentence, that
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is required by Law or required or
requested pursuant to legal or regulatory process to disclose. In the event
that Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is required by Law or required or
requested pursuant to legal or regulatory process to disclose
such information, Purchaser shall reasonably promptly notify Parent in
writing unless not permitted by Law or such legal or regulatory process to so
notify, which notification shall include the nature of such legal or
regulatory requirement or request, as applicable, and the extent of the
required or requested disclosure, and will use commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with Parent, at Parents expense, to preserve to the extent
reasonably practicable the confidentiality of such information. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit, restrict,
require prior notice with respect to, or in any other way affect Purchaser or
its Representatives communications with any Governmental Entity,
or communications with any official or staff person of a Governmental Entity,
concerning matters relevant to such Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding

proper or advisable under any applicable Laws to consummate and make effective
in an expeditious manner the Sale and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including (i) the preparation and filing of all
forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the Sale
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) taking all
actions necessary to obtain (and cooperating with each other in obtaining) any
consent, clearance, expiration or termination of a waiting period,
authorization, Order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental
Entity (which actions shall include furnishing all information required under
any Competition Laws or any other applicable Laws relating to the filings
and/or notifications set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule) required to be obtained or made by Purchaser or Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Sale and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Sale and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement. Additionally, each of Parent and Purchaser
shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
any applicable Laws to fulfill all conditions precedent to this Agreement and
shall use reasonable best efforts not to take any action after the date of
this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to materially delay the
obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any consent, clearance, expiration
or termination of a waiting period, authorization, Order or approval of, or
any exemption by, any Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained at or prior
to the Closing.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law,
Purchaser and Parent shall each keep the other reasonably apprised of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the Sale and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required consents, clearances, expirations or
terminations of waiting periods, authorizations, Orders or approvals of, or
any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity. In that regard, prior to the
Closing, subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, to
the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, each of Parent and Purchaser
shall promptly consult with the other party to provide any reasonably
necessary information with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence,
provide the other party (or their counsel) copies of) all filings made by
such party with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by
such party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection
with this Agreement, the Sale and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section_ __ _
6.2_, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, each party to this
Agreement shall promptly inform the other party to this Agreement, and if in

 the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and except as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.20_, permit the other party to review and
discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party
in connection with, any proposed written or oral communication or submission
with or to any such Governmental Entity or other such Person. If any party to
this Agreement or any representative of such party receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Sale or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, then such party will make, or cause to be made, promptly and
after consultation with the other party to this Agreement, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request. Purchaser, on one hand, and Parent,
on the other hand, shall not participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement or the Sale, or with any other
Person in connection with any Action by a private party relating to any
Competition Laws in connection with this Agreement or the Sale, or make oral
submissions at meetings or in telephone or other conversations, unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by
such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat. Purchaser and Parent may, as each deems in good faith to
be advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other party under this Agreement as "outside counsel
only." Such designated materials and any materials provided by Purchaser
to Parent or by Parent to Purchaser pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_,
and the information contained therein, shall be given only to the outside
legal counsel of the recipient and shall not be disclosed by such outside
counsel and in-house counsel to employees (other than in-house counsel),
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Purchaser or Parent, as the case
may be) or its legal counsel; it being understood that materials provided
pursuant to this Agreement may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning
the valuation of the Business, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
confidentiality arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege concerns.

 

(c) Purchaser and Parent shall file or cause to be filed, as promptly as
practicable, but in any event no later than five (5) Business Days after the
date of this Agreement, notifications under the HSR Act, and Purchaser and
Parent shall file or cause to be filed, as soon as reasonably practicable, but
in any event no later than eight (8) Business Days after the date of
this Agreement, those other filings and/or notifications set forth (or, where
applicable, drafts thereof) on _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_ of the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Antitrust and Foreign
Investment Filings_ ").

(d) Purchaser shall use its best efforts to resolve such objections, if any,
as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Antitrust
and Foreign Investment Filings. In connection therewith, if any Action is
instituted challenging the Sale or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any applicable Competition Laws, Purchaser shall
use its reasonable best efforts to initiate and/or participate in any Actions,
whether judicial or administrative, to (i) oppose or defend against any Action
by any Governmental Entity to prevent or enjoin the consummation of the Sale
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or (ii) take such
action as necessary to overturn any regulatory Action by any Governmental
Entity to block consummation of the Sale or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including by defending any such Action
brought by any Governmental Entity to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated,
overturned or terminated, including by appeal if necessary, any Order that
makes illegal or prohibits the consummation of the Sale or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement resulting from any such Action.

 



-52- 

    

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Purchaser shall
take all actions reasonably necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Competition Laws so as to enable the Closing to occur as
promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date),
including (i) agreeing to, committing to and effecting, by consent decree,
hold separate Order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any
businesses, product lines or assets of the Transferred Entities, Purchaser,
and their respective Subsidiaries, and (ii) otherwise taking or committing to
take actions that after the Closing would limit Purchasers, the Transferred
Entities or their respective Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to,
or its or their ability to retain, any businesses, product lines or assets of
the Transferred Entities, Purchaser, and their respective Subsidiaries. In
that regard Purchaser shall sell, dispose of, hold separate, or otherwise take
or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect
to, or Purchasers Subsidiaries ability to retain, any of the businesses,
product lines or assets of the Transferred Entities, Purchaser, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries. No actions required to be taken pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)_ shall be considered for purposes of determining
whether a Business Material Adverse Effect has occurred or may occur.

 

(f) Whether or not the Sale is consummated, Purchaser shall be responsible for
all filing fees to obtain any consent, clearance, expiration or termination
of a waiting period, authorization, Order or approval pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_.

as such measures are consistent with the types of measures taken by the

Section 6.9 _Guarantees; Commitments_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing and until the earlier of (x) the applicable
Guarantee is terminated and (y) Purchaser or on of its Affiliates is
substituted for Parent or the applicable Affiliate of Parent under the
applicable Guarantee in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.9(b)_, Purchaser and
the Transferred Entities, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold
harmless Parent and any of its Affiliates against any Liabilities that Parent
or any of its Affiliates suffer, incur or are liable for by reason of or
arising out of or in consequence of (i) Parent or any of its Affiliates
issuing, making payment under, being required to pay or reimburse the issuer
of each guarantee, indemnity, surety bond, letter of credit, letter of

may be indemnified or reimbursed pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.9(a)_;
provided that Purchaser shall not be required to provide such letter of credit

-58- 

    

(b) Without limiting _Section_ __ _ 6.9(a)_ in any respect, Purchaser shall
use its reasonable best efforts, at its sole expense, to cause itself or its
Subsidiaries to be substituted in all respects for Parent and any of its
Affiliates, and for Parent and its Affiliates to be released, effective as of
the Closing (or, if such release is not available prior to Closing, effective
as soon as possible after the Closing), in respect of, or otherwise terminate
(and cause Parent and its Affiliates to be released in respect of), all
obligations of Parent and its Affiliates under each Guarantee (including, in
each case, by using reasonable best efforts to deliver at Closing (i)
agreements to assume reimbursement obligations for such Guarantees and (ii)
instruments of guaranty, letters of credit or other documents required by any
banks, customers or other counterparties with respect to any Guarantees, in
each case, that are in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser and solely to the extent permitted by the Debt Financing). In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, at the request of Parent
or its Affiliates, Purchaser shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to assign
or cause to be assigned any Contract or lease underlying such Guarantee to a
Subsidiary of Purchaser meeting the applicable net worth and other
requirements in such Contract or lease to give effect to the provisions of the
preceding sentence. For any Guarantees for which Purchaser or any Transferred
Entity is not substituted in all respects for Parent and any of its
Affiliates (or for which Parent and any of its Affiliates is not released)
effective as of the Closing and that cannot otherwise be terminated effective
as of the Closing (with Parent and any of its Affiliates to be released in
respect thereof), Purchaser shall continue to use its reasonable best efforts
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to
effect such substitution or termination and release as soon as practicable
after the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, neither Purchaser nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall extend or renew any Contract that terminates more
than one (1) year after the Closing Date and that contains or underlies a
Guarantee unless, prior to or concurrently with such extension or renewal,
Purchaser or the Transferred Entities are substituted for Parent and any of
its Affiliates, and Parent and any of its Affiliates are released, in respect
of all obligations of Parent and any of its Affiliates under such Guarantee.

Section 6.10 _Insurance_. From and after the Closing, the Transferred Entities
shall cease to be insured by the Parent Groups current and historical
insurance policies or programs or by any of its current and historical self-
insured programs, and none of the Transferred Entities, Purchaser or its other
Affiliates shall have any access, right, title or interest to or in any such
insurance policies, programs or self-insured programs (including to all claims
and rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds) to cover any assets of
the Transferred Entities or any Liability of the Transferred Entities or of
or arising from the operation of the Business, in each case, with respect to
any acts, facts, circumstances or omissions after the Closing. The members of
the Parent Group may, to be effective at the Closing, amend any insurance
policies and ancillary arrangements in the manner they deem appropriate to
give effect to this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_; _provided_ , that Parent shall not,
and shall cause the Parent Group not to, take any action that would cause the
Transferred Entities to no longer be eligible for coverage under the Retained
Policies in respect of Pre-Closing Occurrences. Subject to the rest of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.10_, from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall be
responsible for securing all insurance it considers appropriate for the
Transferred Entities and the Business. The parties acknowledge that the
Transferred Entities may be entitled to the benefit of coverage under the
insurance policies of the Parent Group (the " _Retained Policies_ ") with
respect to acts, facts, circumstances or omissions occurring prior to Closing
(" _Pre-Closing  Occurrences_"). For any Pre-Closing Occurrences, from and
after the Closing, Parent will direct such carriers to provide the Transferred
Entities with access to the Retained Policies and shall reasonably cooperate
with Purchaser and the Transferred Entities and take commercially reasonable
actions as may be necessary or advisable to assist the Transferred Entities in
submitting, and to provide support with respect to, such claims to which such
policies are responsive. Parent hereby

 



-59- 

    

 authorizes Purchaser to report any and all Pre-Closing Occurrences arising
in connection with the Transferred Entities to the applicable
insurance providers of the Parent Group to the extent permitted under the
applicable Retained Policy, and where not permitted, Parent agrees, upon
receipt of a written request by Purchaser, to use commercially reasonable
efforts to make such report on Purchasers behalf. With respect to claims for
Pre-Closing Occurrences made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ (or
pending as of the date of this Agreement), (i) if reported to the applicable
insurance provider by Purchaser, Purchaser shall promptly notify Parents
corporate insurance department of such claims, (ii) whether such Pre-Closing
Occurrence was reported to the applicable insurance provider by Purchaser or

Section 6.12 _Misallocated Assets and Misdirected Payments_.

 

(a) If, following the Closing, any right, property or asset that prior to the

Purchaser, the Transferred Entities or their Affiliates in error, Purchaser
shall use reasonable best efforts to transfer, or cause its applicable
Affiliate to transfer such right, property or asset to the applicable member
of the Parent Group as soon as practicable. If, following the Closing, any
right, property or asset that prior to the Closing is part of the Business is
found to have been transferred to or retained by a member of the Parent Group

Section 6.13 _Use of Marks_ _; License_.

 

(a) Except as expressly provided in this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ or in the
Intellectual Property License Agreement, neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall use, or have or acquire the right to use or any other rights
in, any Marks of Parent or any of its Affiliates, including the Seller
Parents logo, the word "PQ" or any variations or derivatives thereof or any
names, trademarks, service Marks or logos of Parent or any of its Affiliates,
or any name, trademark, service Mark or logo that, in the reasonable judgment
of Parent, is similar to any of the foregoing (the " _Parent _ _Names_ ").

(b) The Transferred Entities may continue temporarily to use the Parent Names
following the Closing, and solely in a manner consistent with the continued
operation of the Business immediately prior to the Closing, to the extent used
immediately prior to the Closing, so long as Purchaser shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates, to (i) immediately after the Closing, cease to hold itself
out as having any current affiliation with Parent or any of its Affiliates and
(ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize and eliminate use of the
Parent Names by the Transferred Entities. In any event, as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date (and in any event within one hundred twenty
(120) days thereafter) Purchaser shall and shall cause each of the Transferred
Entities to, (i) cease and discontinue use of all Parent Names and (ii)
complete the removal of the Parent Names from all products, signage, vehicles,
properties, technical information, stationery and promotional or other
marketing materials and other assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, within

Entities to (x) cease to use any service Mark or logo that includes the Parent
Names and (y) to change its name, trademark, service Mark or logo, in each
case, on any electronic medium or website. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
preceding shall not apply to any permitted uses of the Parent Names as set
forth in the Intellectual Property License Agreement, which shall be governed

-61- 

    

(c) Purchaser agrees that use of the Parent Names by the Transferred Entities
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ shall be at a level of quality equal
to or greater than that used by the Transferred Entities in the operation of
the Business immediately prior to the Closing and such use shall comply with
all applicable Laws and industry practice. All goodwill associated with such
use shall inure to the benefit of Parent. Neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates
shall take or fail to take any action which, as a result of such action or
failure to take such action, would reasonably be expected to have an adverse
effect on the value of any of the Parent Names or the goodwill of Parent and
its Affiliates associated therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser
and its Affiliates shall not (i) permit, enable or request anyone to engage
in any act or omission that tarnishes, degrades, disparages or reflects
adversely on a Parent Name, (ii) register or file applications to register in
any jurisdiction any Mark that consists of, incorporates, is confusingly
similar to or is a variation or derivation of any Parent Name, or (iii)
contest the ownership or validity of any Parent Name.

 

Section 6.14 _Non-Solicitation_ _; Non-Compete_.

cause each other member of the Parent Group not to permit, cause or encourage

independent contractor of the Transferred Entities as of Closing or any Person
who has been an employee or independent contractor of the Transferred Entities
within the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the Closing Date,
or seek to persuade any Transferred Business Employee or any such independent
contractor or employee to discontinue employment or engagement, in each case
without Purchasers prior written consent, (ii) for three (3) years following
the Closing Date, hire or attempt to hire in any capacity (whether as an
employee, consultant, independent contractor or otherwise) any Person listed
on  _Section_ __ _ 6.14(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, unless such
Person has been terminated by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates subsequent to
the Closing and who has not been employed or engaged by any Transferred
Entity for a period of at least six (6) months prior to the date of such
hire, without Purchasers prior written consent or (iii) for three (3) years
following the Closing Date, induce or attempt to induce any customer,
supplier, licensee or other business relation of the Transferred Entities to
cease doing business with the Transferred Entities, or in any way interfere
with the relationship between the Transferred Entities and any customer,
supplier, licensee or other business relation thereof (including by inducing
or attempting to induce any such person or entity to reduce the amount of
business it does with the Transferred Entities). For purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.14(a)_, the terms "solicit the employment or services"
shall not be deemed to include generalized searches for employees through
media advertisements of general circulation, employment search firms or open
job fairs.

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, Parent shall not, and shall cause each other
member of the Parent Group not to, and Parent shall not permit, cause or
encourage any of its respective Affiliates to, and shall cause each other
member of the Parent Group not to permit, cause or encourage any of its
respective Affiliates to, for three (3) years following the Closing Date, ,
engage in the Business (such business, a " _Competing Business_ "); _provided_
that nothing in this Agreement shall restrict any member of the Parent Group
at any time from:

 



-62- 

    

(i) (x) owning ten percent (10%) or less of the Equity Interests of
any Person, or (y) investing in any fund in which Parent and its Subsidiaries
are passive and have no discretion with respect to the investment strategy of
such fund;

 

(ii) acquiring and, after such acquisition, owning an interest in any Person
(or its successor) that is engaged in a Competing Business and operating such
Competing Business if such Competing Business generated less than fifteen
percent (15%) of such Persons consolidated annual revenues in the last
completed fiscal year of such Person (provided, that no Sensitive Business
Information shall be disclosed to employees that are engaged on a day-to-day
basis in such Competing Business);

 

(iii) acquiring and, after such acquisition, owning an interest in any Person
(or its successor) that is engaged in a Competing Business and operating such
Competing Business if (A) such Competing Business generated more than fifteen
percent (15%) of such Persons consolidated annual revenues in the last
completed fiscal year of such Person and (B) the applicable member of the
Parent Group, within twelve (12) months after the consummation of such
acquisition, enters into a definitive agreement to cause the divestiture of
the Competing Business of such Person such that the restrictions set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.14(b)_ but for this Section 6.14(b)(ii) would not have
operated to prevent such ownership assuming the completion of such divestiture
had occurred prior to such acquisition, and thereafter uses reasonable best
efforts to complete such divestiture as soon as reasonably practicable;(iv)
complying with its obligations under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements; or

 

(v) owning, operating and engaging in the Retained Business as conducted as of
the date hereof.

restrain or prohibit the consummation of any transaction or series of related
transactions that results in a change of control of Parent or a majority of
the assets of the Parent Group, so long as such acquirer of Parent or a
majority of the assets of the Parent Group is either (x) not engaged in a
Competing Business or (y) if such Acquirer is engaged in a Competing Business,
such Competing Business generated less than fifteen percent (15%) of such
acquirers consolidated annual revenues in the last completed fiscal year of
such Person, calculated on a pro forma basis to include such acquirers annual
revenues for such year and the Parent Groups annual revenues for such year;
_provided_ , that if the Competing Business generated greater than
fifteen percent (15%) of such Acquirers consolidated annual revenues, such
acquirer shall not be deemed in breach of this Section 6.14(c) if such
acquirer within twelve (12) months after acquiring Parent enters into a
definitive agreement to cause the divestiture of such Competing Business; and
(ii) restrain or prohibit any activities, actions or conduct of any Person
that is not directly or indirectly controlled by Parent, including any joint
ventures, partnerships or co-investment vehicles that neither Parent nor any
of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries controls, in the case of this clause

or encouragement of Parent or its controlled Affiliates and (B) such Person
has not received Sensitive Business Information from or on behalf of Parent or
any of its controlled Affiliates.

Section 6.15 _Financing_ _._

 

(a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or
advisable to obtain funds sufficient to fund the Closing Purchase Price, the
Final Purchase Price and any other amounts payable by Purchaser hereunder or
under any Ancillary Agreement or otherwise in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including the payment of all of
Purchasers and its Affiliates costs and expenses incurred in the evaluation,
negotiation and execution of the Sale and the other transactions contemplated
hereby) on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters, in
each case, on or prior to the Closing Date, including (i) maintaining in
effect the Commitment Letters and complying with its obligations thereunder in
accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein,
(ii) satisfying on a timely basis, all conditions to the funding of the
Financing set forth in the Commitment Letters and the Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive debt
financing agreements on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (including, if necessary, any "flex" provisions) (the "
_Definitive Debt Financing Agreements_ "), and (iv) upon the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters and all conditions herein
to Purchasers obligation to effect the Closing under _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ and
_Section_ __ _ 9.2_ (in each case, other than those that can only be
satisfied at the Closing) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Closing in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in the Commitment Letters. In the event that all conditions contained in any
Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements (other than,
with respect to the Debt Financing, the availability of the Equity Financing)
have been satisfied, Purchaser shall enforce the obligations of the Debt
Financing Sources thereunder (and the rights of Purchaser) under the
Commitment Letters and, if applicable, the Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements. Purchaser shall keep Parent informed on a regular and current
basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters and any Alternative Financing
and shall give Parent prompt notice (i) of any fact, change, event or
circumstance that is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse impact on the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters, (ii) if Purchaser becomes aware of any material breach by
any party to the Commitment Letters or Definitive Debt Financing Agreements,
(iii) if Purchaser becomes aware of the expiration or termination (or
attempted or purported termination, whether or not valid) of the Debt
Commitment Letter, (iv) of the receipt by Purchaser of any written or
electronic (including email) notice or communication by any Debt Financing
Source with respect to (A) any actual or threatened breach, default (or
allegation thereof), repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letter or any
Definitive Debt Financing Agreement or any refusal to provide, or stated
intent that it will not provide, by any Debt Financing Source the full amount
of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter for any
reason, (v) of Purchasers good faith belief, for any reason, that it may no
longer be able to obtain all or any portion of any Financing contemplated by
the Commitment Letters on the terms and conditions described therein or (vi)
of Purchasers receipt of any written notice or other written communication
from any person with respect to any (A) actual or potential material breach,
default termination or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter, (B)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or any Definitive Debt Financing Agreement (other than
ordinary course negotiations) and (C) the failure of any condition to the Debt
Financing to be satisfied.

 



-64- 

    

(b) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
not to, agree to or permit any termination, amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its rights under, the
Commitment Letters or Definitive Debt Financing Agreements without Parents
prior written consent _provided_  that, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser
may, without Parents prior written consent, (i) enter into any amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision of
the Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Financing Agreements that would
not, and would not reasonably be expected to, (A) reduce the amount of the
Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter to an amount less
that the amount necessary to finance the transactions contemplated hereby,
(B) adversely affect the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against
any other party to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements, in each case, as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise
modified, relative to the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against
the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date
hereof, (C) materially prevent, delay or impede the consummation of the Sale,
the Debt Financing or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
or (D) impose any new or additional conditions, or otherwise expands any of
the conditions, to the availability and funding of Debt Financing as
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, and (ii) amend, replace,
supplement or otherwise modify the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead
arrangers, book runners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not
executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement. Upon
any such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver, the terms
"Debt Commitment Letter" and "Definitive Debt Financing Agreement" shall mean
the Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Financing Agreement, as
applicable, as so amended, replaced, supplemented or modified. Purchaser shall
promptly deliver to Parent copies of any such amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification of the Debt Commitment Letter and/or any
such waiver of a provision of the Debt Commitment Letter.

(c) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, or the
Debt Commitment Letter or any of the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements
shall be withdrawn, repudiated, terminated or rescinded, regardless of the
reason therefor, then Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable, from the same and/or
alternative financing sources, alternative financing in an amount sufficient
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and pay the
Closing Purchase Price, the Final Purchase Price and any other amounts due
from Purchaser hereunder or under any Ancillary Agreement upon terms and
conditions not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Purchaser as
those in the Debt Commitment Letter (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any related "market flex" provisions), and (ii) promptly notify Parent of such
unavailability and the reason therefor. In the event any alternative financing
is obtained in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 6.15(c)_ (" _Alternative
Financing_ "), references in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall also
be deemed to refer to such Alternative Financing, and if one or more
commitment letters or definitive financing agreements are entered into or
proposed to be entered into in connection with such Alternative Financing,
references in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter" and the
"Definitive Debt Financing Agreements" shall also be deemed to refer to such
commitment letters and definitive financing agreements relating to such
Alternative Financing, and all obligations of Purchaser pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.15_ shall be applicable thereto to the same extent as
Purchasers obligations with respect to the Debt Financing.

 



-65- 

    

(d) _Parent Cooperation_.

 

(i) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Transferred Entities and its and their respective
Representatives to, provide such cooperation as is reasonably requested by
Purchaser, including using reasonable best efforts to (A) make available to
Purchaser and its financing sources the Required Information and such other
financial, business or other pertinent information regarding Parent and its
Subsidiaries that is then available to or readily obtainable by Parent as
Purchaser shall reasonably request in order to consummate the Debt Financing
and that is customarily provided by borrowers for inclusion in bank
information memoranda and similar documents for financings of the type
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (it being understood and agreed
that such information shall not include any information customarily delivered
by an investment bank in the preparation of such bank information memoranda or
similar documents), (B) upon reasonable prior written notice and at reasonable
times, cause management of the Transferred Entities to participate in a
reasonable number of meetings (but not more than one primary bank meeting) (in
each case, which may be held via conference call), drafting sessions, rating
agency presentations and lender due diligence presentations, in each case
at times and locations to be mutually agreed, (C) providing assistance to
Parent and its Debt Financing Sources in the preparation of customary bank
information memoranda, lender presentations and rating agency presentations in
connection with the Debt Financing (the " _Marketing Material_ "), (D)
provide assistance in the preparations for the pledging of collateral (it
being understood that no such pledging of collateral will be effective until
at or after the Closing), (E) deliver at least three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing, to the extent requested by the Purchaser on behalf of the Debt
Financing Sources no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, such documentation and other information required by Governmental
Entities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules
and regulations, including the U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001 and, solely to the
extent applicable to Parent and its Subsidiaries after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, information reasonably necessary
to complete a Beneficial Ownership Certification as defined in 31 CFR
1010.230, and (F) provide reasonable assistance to facilitate at (but not
prior to) the Closing the release of guarantees and the release of liens on
assets of the Business (other than Permitted Liens) that are collateral for
the Debt Financing. Parent hereby consents to the use of the logos of
the Parent and its Subsidiaries in connection with any such debt financing;
provided that such logos shall be used solely in a manner that is not intended
or reasonably likely to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect the
Parent and/or its Subsidiaries or their reputation or goodwill.

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall be required to take or permit the taking of any action
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.15_: (A) that would require Parent, the
Transferred Entities or any of their Affiliates or any other Persons who are
directors or officers of such entities to pass resolutions or consents to
approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing, (B) that would
require Parent of any of its Affiliates (other than a Transferred Entity) or
any other Persons 

 



-66- 

    

 to execute or deliver any certificate, opinion, document, instrument or
agreement or agree to any change or modification of any existing certificate,
opinion, document, instrument or agreement, other than a customary
authorization letter described in the definition of "Required Information",
(C) that would require any Transferred Entity to execute or deliver any
certificate, opinion, document, instrument or agreement, or agree to any

instrument or agreement, in each case, prior to the Closing (it being
understood that no obligations of any Transferred Entity under any
certificate, opinion, document, instrument or agreement delivered pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.15_ shall be required to be effective prior to the
Closing), other than the customary authorization letters described in the
definition of "Required Information", (D) that would cause any representation
or warranty in this Agreement to be breached by Parent or any of its
Affiliates or would cause any condition to the Closing to fail to be
satisfied, (E) that would require Parent or any of its Affiliates to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or incur any other expense, Liability or
obligation in connection with the Debt Financing, (F) that could cause any
director, officer or employee or stockholder of Parent or any of its
Affiliates to incur any personal liability, (G) that could reasonably be
expected to conflict with, result in any violation or breach of, or default
(with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) under, any of their
respective Organizational Documents, or any applicable Law or Contracts, (H)

Affiliates determines could reasonably be expected to jeopardize any attorney-

on, Parent or any of its Affiliates, (I) to prepare or deliver (1) any
financial statements or information that are not available to it and prepared
in the ordinary course of its financial reporting practice (other than
financial statements of the type referred to in _Section_ __ _ 4.6)_ or (2)
any projections or pro forma financial statements, (J) that would, in the
opinion of Parent, interfere with the ongoing operations of its or its
Affiliates businesses (including the Business) or would require an action
that is not within the control of Parent or its Subsidiaries using
commercially reasonable efforts or (K) that would cause significant
competitive harm to Parent or its Subsidiaries if the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated. All non-public or other
confidential information provided by Parent or any of its Representatives
pursuant to this Section 6.15 shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement. Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.15_
or otherwise shall require Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than,
following the Closing, any Transferred Entity) to encumber any of its assets
or be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing or require
any Transferred Entity to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the
Debt Financing prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall, promptly upon request by
Parent, reimburse Parent and its Affiliates for all fees, costs, expenses and
Liabilities incurred by any of them or their respective Representatives in
connection with fulfilling their respective obligations pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.15_ (including reasonable attorneys fees).

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this _Section_ __ _
6.15_ represent the sole obligations of Parent and any of its Representatives
with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any
financing (including the Financing) to be obtained by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement, and no other provision of this Agreement

 



-67- 

    

 (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) or the Ancillary Agreements
shall be deemed to expand or modify such obligations. Purchaser shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses actually suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the Financing or any other financing by Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates (including the arrangement thereof) and any information used
in connection therewith (other than arising from (i) historical financial
statements relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries described in the definition
of "Required Information" provided expressly for use in connection with the
Debt Financing or (ii) the gross negligence, Fraud, willful misconduct or
intentional misrepresentation or intentional breach of this Agreement). The
reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Purchaser set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.15(d)_ are referred to, collectively, as the "
_Reimbursement Obligations_."

Section 6.18 _Pre-Closing Restructuring_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the parties acknowledge and agree that (a) nothing
in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the distribution of any cash or
cash equivalents prior to the Calculation Time, and (b) prior to the Closing,
Parent and its Subsidiaries will take all necessary actions and steps to
effectuate the transactions in _Section_ __ _ 6.18_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule in accordance with the transaction structure steps set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 6.18_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (all such actions, the
" _Pre-Closing Restructuring_"). Parent shall not be entitled to modify or
amend the Closing Structure or the Pre-Closing Restructuring in any manner
that would reasonably be expected to result in any non-de minimis unreimbursed
cost for or non-de minimis adverse effect on Purchaser or the Transferred
Entities without Purchasers prior written consent.

 

Section 6.19 _Release of Liens_ _and Guarantees_. Parent shall, or shall cause
other members of the Parent Group or the Transferred Entities, take such
actions as may be reasonably necessary to release or arrange the release of
all Liens listed on _Section_ __ _ 6.19_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
any guarantees by the Transferred Entities of the obligations secured by such
Liens and any other guarantees of, or Liens securing, the obligations of the
Transferred Entities under any Indebtedness and any guarantees by the
Transferred Entities of the items listed in clause 4 of  _Section_ __ _

categorized under NAICS number 32721 and come within the ISRA "industrial
establishment" definition at N.J.A.C. tit. 7, § 26B-1.4; (ii) the Sale is
subject to ISRA; and (iii) in 2013, an LSRP issued an RAO for the Carlstadt
Facility. In June 2019, Environmental Resources Management (" _ERM_ ")

(b) Within five (5) days of this Agreement, Parent or one of its Subsidiaries
shall submit a GIN to the NJDEP.

 



-69- 

    

(c) In the event the Carlstadt Facility qualifies for an exemption from ISRA,
or an alternative compliance option, under ISRA, Parent may satisfy its ISRA
obligations, if any, by relying on such ISRA exemption or the issuance of
authorization by the NJDEP of an alternative compliance option. In the event
that an exemption or alternative compliance option applies, Parent shall
provide Purchaser with a letter from a lawyer representing Parent
substantiating such conclusion. If no exemption is available, Parent shall
engage an LSRP of Purchasers choosing (" _Purchaser s LSRP_") to perform a
preliminary assessment and complete the ISRA Authorization by issuance of an
RAO prior to the Closing (unless as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _
6.20(d)_). Parent and Purchasers LSRP shall take all actions reasonably
required for ISRA Authorization prior to the Closing. Parent shall keep
Purchaser reasonably apprised of the status and progress with respect to ISRA
Authorization and shall provide, as reasonably requested by Purchaser, copies
of all reports and other documents prepared in connection with the ISRA
Authorization process prior to and after the Closing. Purchaser shall bear all
ISRA Authorization Costs incurred pre-Closing and post-Closing.

(d) In the event that ISRA applies and an RAO cannot be obtained prior to the
Closing, Parent shall file a Remediation Certification and the parties shall
consummate the Sale in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.3_. Except as set
forth above, Purchaser shall take all actions reasonably required for
ISRA Authorization post-Closing. If the Closing occurs in the circumstances
described above, Parent agrees to provide to Purchasers LSRP, agents and any
applicable Governmental Entities a right of reasonable pre-Closing access to
the Carlstadt Facility in order to enable Purchaser to conduct the ISRA
Authorization process with the issuance of an RAO by the LSRP. Purchaser shall
use reasonable efforts not to disturb or disrupt any monitoring wells, if
any, at the Carlstadt Facility, or any equipment or other material, if any,
related to the ISRA Authorization process.

 

(e) Until the Closing Date, except as required by applicable Law, Purchaser
shall not, and shall cause its representatives not to, contact or communicate
with any Governmental Entity concerning: (i) the Transferred Entities
compliance or alleged non-compliance with Environmental Laws at the Carlstadt
Facility; and/or (ii) the presence or alleged presence of any Hazardous
Materials, including but not limited to ISRA hazardous substances or wastes,
at or under the Carlstadt Facility or any property adjacent to the Carlstadt
Facility, in each case, without the prior written consent of Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If such
consent is granted, Parent shall have the right to participate in all such
communications with the applicable Governmental Entity, and Purchaser agrees
to provide Parent the opportunity, on reasonable advance notice, to
participate in any substantive meetings or discussions, either in person or by
telephone, between Purchaser and/or its representatives, on the one hand, and
any Governmental Entity, on the other hand, concerning or in connection with
matters addressed in this _Section_ __ _ 6.20_.

(f) Parent acknowledges that Purchaser shall conduct and control the scope of
the investigation and if necessary any remediation required under ISRA and
Parent shall have no decision-making authority with regard to the scope and
manner in which the investigation and if necessary remediation under ISRA is
conducted or completed.

(g) Parent shall not submit any documents in connection with ISRA
Authorization to a Governmental Entity without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 

(h) Parent agrees that it shall cooperate with Purchaser with respect to the
ISRA Authorization process and shall execute such documents as are required
to complete ISRA Authorization. These documents shall include, but not be
limited to, execution of any deed notice, permit application for a remedial
action permit (" _RAP_ "), CEA or any equivalent document. Purchaser and the
Transferred Entities shall be designated as the party with primary
responsibility for permit compliance for any RAP issued with respect to a deed
notice and/or CEA at the completion of the ISRA Authorization process. To the
extent the Transferred Entities have any monitoring and reporting obligations
under a RAP, subsequent to Closing, Purchaser and Transferred Entities shall
be responsible for any and all monitoring and reporting with respect to all
institutional and engineering controls, financial assurance obligations, the
biennial filings and reporting and any RAPs associated therewith.

(i) This  _Section_ __ _ 6.20_ shall survive Closing.

Section 6.21 _Data Room_. Upon the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall
promptly terminate any third partys and any of such third-partys officers,
directors, employees, representatives, consultants, financial advisors,

perform when due, and Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Entities) and its and their respective Representatives (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") shall not assume or have any responsibility for,
any or all of the Retained Liabilities, and Parent shall execute and deliver
at Closing an instrument of assumption for such purpose in respect of the
Retained Liabilities in Approved Form. From and after the Closing, Parent

any, shall provide that (a) the insurer shall have no, and shall waive and not
pursue any and all, subrogation rights against Parent, except for Fraud, (b)
Parent and any Parent Indemnitee shall be third party beneficiaries of such
waiver, and (c) following the Closing, Purchaser shall not amend the
subrogation provisions of the RandW Insurance Policy in any manner that would
allow the insurer thereunder or any other Person to subrogate or otherwise
make or bring any claim or Action against Parent based upon, arising out of,
or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, or performance
of this Agreement (except for Fraud), in each case, without Parents express

effort to obtain the RandW Insurance Policy, including by making available due

Business Days from the date hereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the

on which all of the conditions set forth in _Article IX_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by the taking of actions

the Parent from causing the Australian Transferred Entities to take, or the
Australian Transferred Entities from taking, all reasonable measures
(including as a response to any Pandemic Measures) that Parent or the
Australian Transferred Entities deem fit in good faith in order to preserve
the business of the Australian Transferred Entities as a result thereof so
long as such measures are consistent with the types of measures taken by the
Sellers with respect to the Retained Business;  _provided_ , further, that
Parent and the Australian Transferred Entities shall keep Purchaser reasonably
informed of, and to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with Purchaser
prior to the taking of any such measures; (2) not permit the Australian
Transferred Entities to take any action or omit to take any action which would
constitute a breach of clauses (ii) to (xvii) of _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ if such
provision was applicable from the Closing to the ATE Closing and (3) except
in connection with the Australian Reorganization and this _Section_ __ _
6.24_, shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, sell, transfer,
assign, pledge or dispose of any of the Equity Interests of the Australian

paid from the Australian Transferred Entities, (C) the profits from the

the bank account of the Australian Transferred Entities or a bank account of

Entities, and will only be used for business needs of the Australian
Transferred Entities, which for the avoidance of doubt will not include the
Retained Business and (d) no Australian Transferred Entity will make any
other payments that would constitute customary leakage (collectively, " _ATE
Leakage_ ").

covenants other than covenants effecting the transfer of the Australian Shares
to Purchaser (the " _ATE Closing_ "); and Purchaser shall, and shall cause

the extent related to the Retained Business, under each Shared Contract, and

which has been provided to Purchaser prior to the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the compensation and benefits provided to any

and for the same purpose as such service is recognized by Parent and its
applicable Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) immediately prior

earned but unused vacation time that arise as a result of the transfer of
employment contemplated by this Article VII) to the extent such accrued but
unused vacation time is included in Working Capital. Purchaser shall promptly
(and, in any event, within ten (10) Business Days following the later of the
Closing Date and the date of the applicable payment) reimburse Parent or its
applicable Affiliates for any payments made by them to any Transferred
Business Employees in respect of such accrued but unused vacation time that
becomes due and is paid to a Transferred Business Employee by Parent or one
of its Affiliates as a result of the transfer of employment contemplated by
this _Article VII_. During the Continuation Period, Purchaser shall allow
Transferred Business Employees to use the accrued and unused vacation time
recognized in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 7.6 in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Benefit Plans in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date (in addition to, and not in lieu of,
any vacation accrued under the applicable vacation plans or policies of
Purchaser or its Affiliates on or following the Closing).

 

Section 7.6 _401(k) Plan Accounts_. Effective as of the Closing, Parent shall
cease all contributions in respect of each Transferred Business Employee in
Parents tax qualified defined contribution plan in which such individual is
then participating (" _Parent_ __ _s 401(k) Plan_ "). As of or as soon as
administratively feasible after the Closing, the Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates shall establish or have in effect one or more defined contribution
plans that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the
meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (" _Purchaser_ __ _s_ _401(k)_ _Plan_
"), and each Transferred Business Employee who was eligible to participate in
Parents 401(k) Plan prior to the Closing shall become eligible to participate
in Purchasers 401(k) Plan. Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser 401(k) Plan
to accept "direct rollovers" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the
Code) of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section

 



-78- 

    

 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the Parent 401(k) Plan relating to any
Transferred Business Employee, including the amount of any unpaid balance of
any participant loan (and the related promissory note) under the Parent
401(k) Plan, to the extent such rollover is elected by such Transferred
Business Employee in accordance with the terms of the Parents 401(k) Plan,
the terms of the Purchasers 401(k) Plan and applicable Law.

 

Section 7.7 _Cash Incentive Compensation_. Purchaser shall assume all
Liability for any cash incentive compensation (including sales commissions)
payable under any Benefit Plan in respect of the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs to Transferred Business Employees in connection with their
services to the Business (the " _Cash Incentive Compensation_ ") to
the extent that such Cash Incentive Compensation has been accrued and is
scheduled to be paid, in the Ordinary Course of Business, following the
Closing, and the Parent Group shall not have any Liability for the Cash
Incentive Compensation following the Closing. All Cash Incentive Compensation
shall be payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Benefit
Plan that governed such Cash Incentive Compensation prior to the Closing, and
in accordance with Purchasers obligations under  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_; it
being understood that any portion of such Cash Incentive Compensation that is
payable based solely on Parents earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization (" _EBITDA_ ") shall instead be based on the EBITDA of the
Business (using the same EBITDA metrics with respect to the Business under
such Benefit Plans as applied prior to Closing).

 

Section 7.8 _Collective Bargaining Agreements_. As of the Closing Date, the
Transferred Entities shall continue to recognize the unions and works
councils that are signatories to the collective bargaining or other labor
Contracts covering Transferred Business Employees and set forth on _Section_
__ _ 4.12(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule as the representatives of
the Transferred Business Employees of the bargaining units described therein.

Section 7.9 _Seller Benefit Plans; Transferred Entity Benefit Plans_. Except
as otherwise expressly provided in this _Article VII_ or with respect to any
payments made under the Transition Services Agreement, the Parent Group shall
assume or retain and be solely responsible for, and Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall not assume any obligations under, or Liabilities with respect
to, or receive any right or interest in any trusts relating to, any assets of
or any insurance, administration or other contracts, or related Liabilities
or obligations pertaining to, any Seller Benefit Plan, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any obligations under COBRA with respect to any individual
who is an "MandA qualified beneficiary" as defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-4(a). Effective as of the Closing Date or if
applicable, the end of any coverage provided under the terms of
the Transition Services Agreement, each Transferred Business Employee shall
cease to participate in each Seller Benefit Plan as an active employee, and
each Transferred Entity shall cease to be a participating employer in each
Seller Benefit Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, as of the Closing, Purchaser
and its Affiliates shall assume, or shall cause the Transferred Entities to
assume or retain, as the case may be, sponsorship of, and all Liabilities and
other obligations with respect to, only the Transferred Entity Benefit Plans.

 



-79- 

    

Section 7.10 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Without limiting the generality
of  _Section_ __ _ 11.5_, nothing in this Agreement is intended to or shall
(a) be treated as the establishment of or an amendment to, or be construed as
establishing or amending, any Seller Benefit Plan, Transferred Entity Benefit
Plan or other benefit plan, program or agreement sponsored, maintained or
contributed to by any Seller, any Transferred Entity, Purchaser or any of
their respective Affiliates, (b) prevent Purchaser or its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing, the Transferred Entities) from amending,
modifying or terminating any Transferred Entity Benefit Plan or any other
benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, agreement, or arrangement at
any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, (c)
prevent Purchaser or its Affiliates, on or after the Closing Date, from
terminating or modifying the terms or conditions of the employment of any
Business Employee, or (d) confer any rights or remedies (including third-
party beneficiary rights) on any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement, including any current or former director, employee, consultant or
independent contractor of any Seller, any Transferred Entity, Purchaser
or any of their respective Affiliates or any beneficiary or dependent thereof
or any other Person.

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 8.1 _Structuring Matters_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall (or shall cause its relevant Affiliates to) make timely
and irrevocable elections under Section 338(g) of the Code (and any
corresponding elections under any applicable state or local Tax Law) with
respect to the acquisition of the Equity Interests of the Section 338(g)
Entities pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, the " _Section_ __ _
338(g) Elections_"), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement; _provided_ that if Parent notifies Purchaser on or before the date
that is thirty (30) days following the Closing Date of its desire to make a
Check Open Election with respect to one or more of the 338(g) Entities or
Potters (Thailand) Limited, then Purchaser and Parent shall effect such Check
Open Elections (in lieu of making a 338(g) Election, with respect to the
338(g) Entities so specified in Parents notice), but shall make such 338(g)
Elections with respect to any Section 338(g) Entity not so specified.
Purchaser shall (or shall cause its relevant Affiliates to) prepare
all forms, attachments and schedules necessary to effectuate the Section
338(g) Elections or Check Open Elections in a manner consistent with the
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule and the Allocation and shall timely file
such forms with the applicable taxing authorities. Purchaser agrees that it
shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, revoke any of the
Section 338(g) Elections or Check Open Elections without the prior written
consent of Parent.

 

(b) Parent and its Affiliates agree to join in an appropriate and timely
manner with Purchaser in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code, and any corresponding election permitted under any state or local Law
(collectively, the " _Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10) Election_") with respect to
Purchasers indirect acquisition of Potters Industries Holding, Inc. Parent
and its Affiliates shall cooperate with Purchaser to take all actions
necessary or appropriate to effect and preserve a timely Section 338(h)(10)
Election with respect to Purchasers acquisition of Potters Industries
Holding, Inc., including participating in the timely filing of IRS Form 8023
and related or comparable forms required under applicable state and local Law.
Purchaser shall (or shall cause its relevant Affiliates to) prepare
all forms, attachments and schedules necessary to effectuate the Section
338(h)(10) Election in a manner consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule and the Allocation.

 



-80- 

    

(c) After the date hereof, the parties hereto shall cooperate in good faith to
explore whether Purchaser or its Affiliates can acquire any of the
Subsidiaries of Luxco directly from Luxco and in each case, without (a)
causing any incremental adverse Tax consequences to the Sellers or the Parent
Group relative to the Tax consequences that will result if such Subsidiaries
are acquired indirectly through the sale of Luxco or (b) delaying the time of
the Closing relative to the time when the Closing would occur if such
Subsidiaries are acquired indirectly through the sale of Luxco.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if the parties hereto
mutually agree that such direct acquisitions can be effected without causing
Sellers or the Parent Group such adverse Tax consequences or so delaying the
Closing, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such
acquisitions in a mutually acceptable manner (and to amend _Exhibit C_ in a
manner that reflects such acquisitions but otherwise maintains the
underlying principles of the original _Exhibit C_ , _mutatis mutandis_ ), and
(ii) no further exploration of whether Purchaser or its Affiliates can acquire
any of the Subsidiaries of Luxco shall be conducted if at any time such
further exploration would reasonably be expected to delay the Closing.

Section 8.2 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(a) For all U.S. federal (and applicable state and local) Tax purposes, Parent
and Purchaser agree to (and agree to cause their respective Affiliates to)
(i) allocate the Final Purchase Price and any other amounts treated as
consideration for such Tax purposes among the Shares and the Lux Note and (ii)
further allocate the Final Purchase Price and any other amounts treated
as consideration for such tax purposes among the assets of (I) the
Transferred Companies treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as either
partnerships or entities disregarded from their owners (taking into account
any Check Open Elections) and (II) the Section 338(g) Entities and Potters
Industries Holding, Inc., in each case, that are deemed sold for U.S. federal
Income Tax purposes, in each case in accordance with the methodologies set
forth on _Exhibit G_ attached hereto (the " _Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule_ ").

(b) No later than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the date on which
the Final Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.7_, Parent shall deliver to Purchaser a proposed allocation of the Final
Purchase Price and any other items that are treated as
additional consideration for Tax purposes among the Shares and the Lux Note
and assets described in _Sections 8.2(a)(_ _i_ _)_ and _(ii)_ , respectively,
in accordance with Sections 338 and 1060, and as applicable, 751 and 755 of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and the Purchase
Price Allocation Schedule (the " _Parent_ __ _s Allocation_ "). If Purchaser
disagrees with the Parents Allocation, Purchaser may, within thirty (30)
days after delivery of the Parents Allocation, deliver a notice ("
_Purchaser_ __ _s Allocation Notice_ ") to Parent to such effect, specifying
those items as to which Purchaser disagrees and setting forth Purchasers
proposed allocation. If Purchasers Allocation Notice is duly and timely
delivered, Parent and Purchaser shall, during the twenty (20) days following
such delivery, use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items or amounts in order to determine the allocation of the Final
Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts). If Parent and Purchaser are
unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause the
Independent Accounting Firm to resolve any remaining disputes. Any allocation
of the Final Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts) determined pursuant
to the decision of the Independent Accounting Firm shall incorporate, reflect
and be consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule and the terms
of this Agreement. Any costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm
incurred pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_ shall be borne equally 

 



-81- 

    

 by Parent, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand. The
allocation, as prepared by Parent if no Purchasers Allocation Notice has been
timely given, as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between Parent and
Purchaser or as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_ (the " _Allocation_ "), shall be conclusive and
binding on the parties. The Allocation shall be adjusted, as necessary, to
reflect any subsequent payments treated as adjustments to the Final Purchase
Price pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.6_. Any such adjustment shall be
allocated, consistent with this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_, to the Equity
Interests, the Lux Note and/or asset or assets of the Transferred Companies to
which such adjustment is attributable.

 

(c) Parent and the Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to) (i) prepare and file all Tax Returns (including all forms,
attachments and schedules necessary to effectuate the Section 338(g)
Elections, the Section 338(h)(10) Election and any Check Open Elections), in a
manner consistent with the Section 338(g) Elections, the Section 338(h)(10)
Election, any Check Open Elections, the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule and
the Allocation (and any adjustments thereto) and (ii) not take any position
inconsistent therewith on any Tax Return, in connection with any Tax
Proceeding or otherwise, in each case, except to the extent otherwise required
pursuant to a "determination" (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law). In the
event that the Allocation is disputed by any taxing authority, the party
receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly notify the other party in
writing of such notice and resolution of the dispute.

 

Section 8.3 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_.

 

(a) Not more than thirty (30) days after the receipt of a request from Parent,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to Parent a
package of Tax information materials, including schedules and work papers,
reasonably requested by Parent to enable Parent to prepare and file all Tax
Returns required to be prepared and filed by it with respect to the
Transferred Entities. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
prepare such package completely and accurately, in good faith and in a manner
consistent with Parents past practice.

 

(b) Each party to this Agreement shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide to the other party to this Agreement such cooperation, documentation
and information as either of them reasonably may request in (i) filing any Tax
Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, (ii) determining a Liability
for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes or (iii) conducting any Tax
Proceeding. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of
all relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with all relevant
portions of relevant accompanying schedules and relevant work papers, relevant
documents relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities
and relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property and
other information, which any such party may possess. Each party shall make its
employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis at its cost to
provide an explanation of any documents or information so provided.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Parent nor
any of the Sellers shall be required to provide any Person with any Tax
Return or copy of any Tax Return of (i) Parent or a member of the Parent Group
or (ii) a consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary group that includes
any member of the Parent Group.

 



-82- 

    

(c) Each party shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, and
all material records and other documents relating to Tax matters, of the
relevant entities for their respective Tax periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date until the earlier of (i) the expiration of the statute of
limitations for the Tax periods to which the Tax Returns and other documents
relate and (ii) six (6) years following the due date (without extension) for
such Tax Returns. Thereafter, the party holding such Tax Returns or other
documents may dispose of them after offering the other party reasonable
notice and opportunity to take possession of such Tax Returns and other
documents at such other partys own expense ( _provided_ that any such notice
must in any event be made in writing at least sixty (60) days prior to such
disposition; _provided_ , _further_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that Parent
shall have no obligation to offer Purchaser any Tax Returns or other documents
described in the final sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_).

Section 8.4 _Preparation and Filing of Returns_. Parent shall prepare and file
all Tax Returns of the Transferred Entities in respect of which items of
income, deduction, credit, gain or loss are passed through, directly or
indirectly, to a Seller (or its direct or indirect owners) (" _Flow-Through
Tax Returns_ ") that are required to be filed after the Closing Date for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date. Not later than fifteen
(15) days prior to the due date for filing any such Tax Return, Parent shall
provide Purchaser with a copy of each such Tax Return for its review and
shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments of Purchaser thereon.
Purchaser shall prepare and file all Tax Returns other than Flow-Through Tax
Returns of the Transferred Entities that are required to be filed for a Pre-
Closing Period or Straddle Period; and in the case of any such Tax Return that
could reasonably be expected to affect the amounts to which the Sellers are
entitled or their obligations under Law or this Agreement, including under
_Section_ __ _ 2.7,_ (a) such Tax Return shall be prepared in accordance with
past practice to the extent supported by a "more likely than not" (or higher)
standard under applicable Law, and (b) not later than fifteen (15) days prior
to the due date for filing any such Tax Return, Purchaser shall provide Parent
with a copy of such Tax Return for its review and shall consider in good faith
any reasonable comments of Parent thereon. If Purchaser, any of its
Affiliates or any of the Transferred Entities receives notice of any audit,
investigation, or other action by a Governmental Entity in respect of any
Flow-Through Tax Return for a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on
or before the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Audit_"), then such party
will promptly (and in any event within fifteen (15) days) give written notice
to Parent. Parent will have the right, at its own expense, to control the
defense of the Pre-Closing Tax Audit so long as (A) Parent gives written
notice to Purchaser within fifteen (15) days after the applicable party has
given notice to Parent of the Pre-Closing Tax Audit, and (B) Parent keeps the
Purchaser reasonably informed of all material matters that come to its
attention in respect of the Pre-Closing Tax Audit. The Purchaser will be
entitled to participate in the defense of any Pre-Closing Tax Audit, at its
own expense. Where Parent does not elect to control the defense of the Pre-
Closing Tax Audit, Parent may, at its own expense, nevertheless participate in
the defense of the Pre-Closing Tax Audit. The party controlling any Pre-
Closing Tax Audit shall not settle or compromise such Pre-Closing Tax Audit
without the consent of the non-controlling party (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, if requested by Purchaser, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be
permitted to cause any Transferred Entity treated as a partnership for
U.S. federal Income Tax purposes to make a "push out" election under Section
6226 of the Code (and any corresponding election available under applicable
state or local Law) with respect to any "imputed underpayment" of or
with respect to such Transferred Entity for a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle
Period, and (ii) any Transferred Entity treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal Income Tax purposes (taking into account any Check Open Election)
shall make an election under Section 754 of the Code for the taxable year that
includes the Closing Date, to the extent such Transferred Entity does not
already have such an election in effect. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser shall have no review or comment rights pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to any such Tax Return of any consolidated, combined,
affiliated or unitary group that includes any member of the Parent Group.

 



-83- 

    

Section 8.5 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. On or before the Closing Date, the
rights and obligations of the Transferred Entities pursuant to all Tax
sharing agreements or arrangements (other than this Agreement), if any, to
which any of the Transferred Entities, on the one hand, and any member of the
Parent Group, on the other hand, are parties (provided that there are no
other parties to such agreements or arrangements), shall terminate, and
neither any member of the Parent Group, on the one hand, nor any of the
Transferred Entities, on the other hand, shall have any rights or obligations
to each other after the Closing in respect of such agreements or arrangements.

Section 8.6 _Tax Treatment of Payments_. Except to the extent otherwise
required pursuant to a "determination" (within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), Parent,
Purchaser, the Transferred Entities and their respective Affiliates shall
treat any and all payments under _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ as an adjustment to the
purchase price for Tax purposes.

 

Section 8.7 _Post-Closing Tax Covenant_. Purchaser shall not, and shall not
cause its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) to

(a) make any entity classification election pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 301.7701-3, which election would be effective on or prior
to the Closing Date,

(b) take any action on the Closing Date after the Closing that is outside the
Ordinary Course of Business with respect to the Transferred Entities or the
Business, other than the liquidation or dissolution (including through an
upstream or downstream merger) of Potters Holdings GP, Ltd. or Potters
Holdings, L.P.

(c) amend any Flow-Through Tax Return or election made in connection
with such Flow-Through Tax Return with respect to any of the Transferred
Entities for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date,

(d) initiate or enter into any voluntary disclosure agreement or program with
any taxing authority with respect to any Tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date, in each case (x) prior to the date on which the Final Purchase
Price is finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, (y) with
respect to any Flow-Though Tax Return or (z) to the extent related to any
Transferred Entity that is classified as a foreign corporation for U.S.
federal Income Tax purposes and in respect of which a Section 338(g) Election
or Check Open Election has not been made pursuant to Section 8.1(a), from the
Closing Date through the end of the taxable period of such entity that
includes the Closing Date,

 

(e) change any method of accounting for Tax purposes or Tax accounting period
for any Tax Period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date,
in each case (x) prior to the date on which the Final Purchase Price is
finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7,_ (y) with respect to any
Flow-Though Tax Return or (z) to the extent related to any Transferred Entity
that is classified as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal Income Tax
purposes and in respect of which a Section 338(g) Election or Check Open
Election has not been made pursuant to Section 8.1(a), from the Closing Date
through the end of the taxable period of such entity that includes the Closing
Date or

 



-84- 

    

(f) with respect to any Transferred Entity that is classified as a foreign
corporation for U.S. federal income Tax purposes and in respect of which a
Section 338(g) Election or Check Open Election has not been made pursuant to
Section 8.1(a), from the Closing Date through the end of the taxable period of
such entity that includes the Closing Date, (i) take any action outside the
Ordinary Course of Business that could reasonably be expected to increase
Sellers (or any Affiliate of Sellers) pro rata share of amounts determined
under Section 951(a)(1) or 951A(a) of the Code or (ii) enter into any
extraordinary transaction with respect to any such Transferred Entity or
otherwise take any action or enter into any transaction that would be
considered under the Code to constitute the payment of an actual or deemed
dividend by such Transferred Entity, including pursuant to Section 304 of the
Code, or that would otherwise result in a diminution of foreign Tax credits
that, absent such transaction, may be claimed by Sellers or any of their
Affiliates or a change in the application of Section 245A of the Code to the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates as compared with such application absent
such transaction,

 

in each case of clauses (a)-(f) above, that could reasonably be expected to
(A) increase the liability of any of the Sellers or their
respective Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities) for Taxes or (B)
reduce the amounts payable to the Sellers or increase the amounts payable by
the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ that nothing in this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.7_ shall be deemed to restrict the making of the Section
338(g) Elections, the Section 338(h)(10) Election, or Check Open Elections as
and to the extent required by  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_ or _Section_ __ _
8.1(b)_.

Section 8.8 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, (i) Purchaser shall pay, when due, and be responsible for, any
sales, use, transfer, real property transfer, registration, documentary,
conveyance, franchise, goods and services, stamp, value added or similar
Taxes and related fees and costs (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") imposed by a U.S.
federal or state or local taxing authority on, or payable in the United States
or a U.S. state or local jurisdiction in connection with, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) Purchaser, on the one hand, and
Sellers on the other hand, shall each pay, when due, and be responsible for,
one-half of any Transfer Taxes imposed by a non-U.S. taxing authority on, or
payable in a non-U.S. jurisdiction in connection with, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that any Transfer Taxes imposed on
or payable in connection with the Pre-Closing Restructuring shall be the sole
responsibility of the Sellers. The party responsible under applicable Law for
filing the Tax Returns with respect to any such Transfer Taxes shall prepare
and timely file such Tax Returns and promptly provide a copy of such Tax
Return to the other party. Parent and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, cooperate to timely prepare and file any Tax
Returns or other filings relating to such Transfer Taxes, including any claim
for exemption or exclusion from the application or imposition of any Transfer
Taxes; _provided_ that, notwithstanding any of the foregoing, neither Parent
nor any of its Affiliates nor Purchaser shall be required to file any claim
for exemption or exclusion from the application or imposition of any Transfer
Taxes, or any claim for any reduction thereof, if Parent or Purchaser,
as applicable, determines in its sole discretion that the filing of such
claim or any related action would have an adverse effect on Parent or any of
its Affiliates or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Closing Purchase Price set forth in this Agreement is exclusive of
Transfer Taxes.

Agreement under this clause shall not be available to any party to this

to perform in any material respect any of its respective representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, or any

satisfied, and (ii) (A) is incapable of being cured prior to the Outside Date
or (B) if capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date, has not been

prior to the Outside Date or (B) if capable of being cured prior to the

(f) by Parent if (i) after December 1, 2020, all of the conditions in

Agreement by either or both of Parent and Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.1_, written notice of such termination shall be given by the terminating
party to the other. 

Section 10.3 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) Subject in all cases to _Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)-(e)_ in the event of
termination of this Agreement by either or both of Parent and Purchaser
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1_, this Agreement shall terminate and become
void and have no effect, and there shall be no Liability on the part of any
party to this Agreement, except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)_ and
the Reimbursement Obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.15(d)_;
_provided_ that termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party
hereto from Liability for any willful and material breach of this Agreement
prior to such termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ ( _Confidentiality_ ), the
Reimbursement Obligations set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.15(d)_ ( _Parent
Cooperation_ ), _Article X_ ( _General Provisions_ ) and this _Section_ __ _
10.3_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

 

(b) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 10.1(e)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 10.1(f)_, then Purchaser shall pay to Parent
or its designee a cash amount equal to $35,750,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ")

transfer of immediately available funds within three (3) Business Days after
the date that this Agreement is so validly terminated and receipt of
wire transfer instructions from Parent.

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this  _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) without these agreements, the parties
hereto would not enter into this Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge and
hereby agree that the Termination Fee if, as and when required to be paid
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.3_, shall not constitute a penalty, but
will be liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent
such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the Sale, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement but
subject to  _Section_ __ _ 10.3(e)_, following any termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the right of Parent to collect the
Termination Fee in the circumstances in which it is payable pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) of Parent, the Parent Group
and their Affiliates, and their respective shareholders, members,
managers, general or limited partners, management companies, investment
vehicles, officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives, and each
of their respective successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Parent
Related Parties_ ") against Purchaser, the Purchaser Sponsor, the Debt
Financing Sources, their respective Affiliates and any of their respective
former, current and future direct or indirect Affiliates, representatives,
shareholders, members, managers, general or limited partners, management
companies, investment vehicles, officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives, and each of their respective successors and assigns
(collectively, the " _Purchaser Related Parties_ ") for any losses, damages
or Liabilities suffered or incurred as a result of, in connection with, or
under this Agreement, the Commitment Letters, the Limited Guaranty, any
Ancillary Agreement or any agreement contemplated hereby or thereby, including
in respect of any breach hereunder or thereunder, the failure to perform
hereunder or thereunder (in any case, whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise) or for any representation made or alleged to
have been made in connection herewith or therewith, or otherwise; and under
no circumstances will any Parent Related Party (or the Parent Related Parties
in the aggregate) be entitled to aggregate monetary damages or other monetary
remedies for any losses, damages or Liabilities suffered as a result of the
failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in the Commitment
Letters, any Ancillary Agreement or any agreement contemplated hereby or
thereby, to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or
thereunder (in any case, whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or
otherwise) or for any representation made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, in excess of the Termination Fee and
the Reimbursement Obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.15(d)_.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ shall limit the right of Parent to bring or
maintain any Action (i) for injunction, specific enforcement of the
obligations of Purchaser or any other party under this Agreement or any of
the Ancillary Agreements subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 11.11_, (ii) arising out of or in connection with any breach
of the Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, or (iii) against Purchaser or Purchaser Sponsor in connection with
the Reimbursement Obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.15(d)_. For the
avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, while Parent may pursue both a grant of specific performance in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.11_ and the payment of the Termination Fee,
under no circumstances shall Parent be permitted or entitled to receive both
a grant of specific performance and all or any portion of the Termination Fee
and in no circumstances shall Purchaser be required to pay the Termination Fee
more than once.

 

Section 10.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, either
Parent, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, may (a) extend the
time for performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of
the other contained in this Agreement. Any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party
granting such extension or waiver.

Section 11.8 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their
respective successors and assigns; _provided_ that no party to this Agreement
may directly or indirectly assign any or all of its rights or delegate any or
all of its obligations under this Agreement without the express prior written
consent of each other party to this Agreement, except that (a) Parent may
transfer or assign, in whole or from time to time in part, its rights under
this Agreement to any Affiliate of Parent, but any such transfer or
assignment will not relieve Parent of any of its obligations hereunder and
(b) Purchaser may transfer or assign, its rights, interests or obligations
under this Agreement, in whole or from time

 



-94- 

    

 to time in part, to (i) one or more of its Affiliates or direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, the Transferred
Entities), (ii) any of its Debt Financing Sources for purposes of creating a
security interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of
the Debt Financing and any refinancings, extensions, refundings or renewals
thereof or (iii) following the Closing, to any successor or purchaser of all
or part of the Business or of Purchaser, but, in each case, any such transfer
or assignment will not relieve Purchaser of any of its obligations hereunder.

 

Section 11.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be modified or
amended except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the party
against whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is sought;
provided, however that _Section_ __ _ 10.3(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 11.5_,
_Section_ __ _ 11.9_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.12_ may not be amended or
modified in a manner that is materially adverse to any Debt Financing Source
without the written consent of the related Debt Financing Sources party to the
Debt Commitment Letter. Any party to this Agreement may, only by an
instrument in writing, waive compliance by the other party to this Agreement
with any term or provision of this Agreement on the part of such other party
to this Agreement to be performed or complied with. The waiver by any party
to this Agreement of a breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall
not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach. No failure or delay by
any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
power or privilege.

 

Section 11.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto.
Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

Section 11.11 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary
damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the parties hereto do not perform any provision of this
Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Accordingly, subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.11(b)_, the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled in Law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that it will not oppose, and irrevocably waives its right to object to,
the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief
on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
Law or in equity. Any party hereto seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with such order
or injunction. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties
agree that Parent shall be entitled to specific performance against Purchaser
of Purchasers obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.15_.

 



-95- 

    

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise,
it is acknowledged and agreed that the right of Parent to specific
performance in connection with enforcing the obligations of Purchaser
hereunder to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the
Closing shall be subject to the requirements: (i) all of the conditions set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by the taking of actions
or delivery of documents, or waived, on the Closing Date (and which are, at
the time Parent seeks specific performance pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
11.11_, capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur at such time),
(ii) the Debt Financing (or any Alternative Financing in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 6.15_) has been funded or is available to be funded in full at
the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing (or, if the Debt
Financing (or any such Alternative Financing) has been funded into escrow,
such funds have been or would be released from escrow), (iii) Parent has
irrevocably notified Purchaser in writing that all conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied by the taking of actions or delivery
of documents at the Closing, but each of which is capable of being satisfied
at the Closing) have been satisfied (or that Parent would be willing to waive
any unsatisfied conditions in _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ for purposes of
consummating the Closing) and that if specific performance is granted and the
Equity Financing and Debt Financing (or any Alternative Financing in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.15_) were funded, then the Closing will
occur, and (iv) Purchaser fails to consummate the Closing on or before the
date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_. In
no event shall Purchaser be obligated to both (x) specifically perform the
obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and consummate the
Closing and (y) pay the Termination Fee.

Section 11.12 _Debt Financing Sources Provisions_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Parent on behalf of itself and the Sellers
hereby: (a) agrees that any Action, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the Debt Financing Entities,
arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of
the agreements (including the Debt Commitment Letter) entered into in
connection with the Debt Financing or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder shall
be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the
Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, so long as such forum is and remains
available, and any appellate court thereof and each party hereto irrevocably
submits itself and its property with respect to any such Action to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such court, (b) agrees that any such Action shall be
governed by the Laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to any
conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of the Laws
of another state), except as otherwise provided in the Debt Commitment Letter
or other applicable definitive document relating to the Debt Financing, (c)
agrees that service of process upon Parent or its Subsidiaries in any such
Action shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with _Section_ __ _
11.7_, (d) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively
do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action

 Letter or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the
performance of any services thereunder, (f) agrees that none of the Debt
Financing Entities will have any liability to Parent or the Sellers relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment
Letter or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the
performance of any services thereunder, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise and (g) agrees that the Debt Financing
Entities are express third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the
provisions in this Agreement reflecting the foregoing agreements in this 
_Section_ __ _ 11.12_.

Section 11.13 _No Admission_. Nothing herein shall be deemed an admission
by Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, in any Action or
Action by or on behalf of a third party, that Purchaser, Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates, or that such third party or any of its
Affiliates, is or is not in breach or violation of, or in default in, the
performance or observance of any term or provisions of any Contract.

Section 11.14  _No Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements_.

(a) The representations and warranties and the covenants and agreements that
contemplated performance solely at or prior to the Closing in this Agreement
shall terminate at the Closing or upon the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article X_ , except the covenants and agreements that
expressly contemplate performance after the Closing shall survive the Closing
until fully performed in accordance with their respective terms. The parties
acknowledge and agree that, other than in connection with any Fraud, from and
after the Closing they shall not be permitted to make, and no party shall
have any liability or obligation with respect to, any claims for any breach of
any representation or warranty set forth herein or any covenant or agreement
herein that is to have been performed by another party at or prior to the
Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing, other than in connection with any
Fraud, from and after the Closing, each party hereby waives (on behalf of
itself, each of its Affiliates and each of its Representatives), to the
fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action (including any statutory rights to contribution or indemnification) for
any breach of any representation or warranty or covenant or obligation to have
been performed prior to the Closing set forth herein or otherwise relating to
any of Parent, Purchaser, the Sellers or the Transferred Entities or the
subject matter of this Agreement that such party may have against the other
parties or any of their Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
arising under or based upon any theory whatsoever, under any Law, contract,
tort or otherwise.

 

(b) The Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except as expressly
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, the foregoing  _Section_ __ _ 11.14(a)_ or
in connection with any Fraud or as provided in any Ancillary Agreement, from
and after Closing none of Parent, its Representatives or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers, managers, employees or agents, shall have
any liability, responsibility or obligation arising under this Agreement or
any exhibit or Schedule hereto, or any certificate or other document entered
into, made, delivered or made available in connection herewith, or as
a result of any of the transactions contemplated hereby, such provisions and
other documents being the sole and exclusive remedy (as between the Purchaser
and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Parent and its Affiliates, on the
other hand) for all claims, disputes and losses arising hereunder or
thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, whether purporting to sound
in contract or tort, or at Law or in equity, or otherwise. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall
limit or preclude the ability of either party to bring an Action for Fraud
against the Person committing such Fraud.

Section 11.15 _Privilege_. Purchaser hereby agrees, on its own behalf and
on behalf of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities after the
Closing), that, following the Closing, Ropes and Gray LLP and Babst, Calland,
Clements and Zomnir, P.C. (" _Parent Group_ __ _s Counsel_ ") may serve as
counsel to the Parent Group and their Affiliates in connection with any
matters related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, the negotiation, performance or
subject matter hereof or thereof, or the Sale, notwithstanding any
representation by Parent Groups Counsel prior to the Closing Date of the
Transferred Entities. Purchaser hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities after the
Closing), (i) to waive any claim they have or may have that Parent Groups
Counsel has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging
in such representation and (ii) that, in the event that a dispute arises after
the Closing between Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including any
Transferred Entity), on the one hand, and the Parent Group or any of
their Affiliates, on the other hand, Parent Groups Counsel may represent the
Parent Group and/or any of its Affiliates in such dispute even though the
interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including any Transferred Entity) and even though Parent Groups
Counsel may have represented any Transferred Entity in a matter substantially
related to such dispute. Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Entities after the Closing) also further agree
that, as to all communications to or from Parent Groups Counsel, on the one
hand, and any or all of the Transferred Entities, the Parent Group or their
Affiliates and their respective Representatives, on the other hand, that
relate in any way to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, the
negotiation, performance or subject matter hereof or thereof, or the
transactions contemplated hereby, the attorney-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs and will belong solely to the
Parent Group and will not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser or its Affiliates
(including any Transferred Entity after the Closing). Without limitation of
the foregoing, none of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including any
Transferred Entity after the Closing) may use or rely upon any communications
described in the immediately preceding sentence in any dispute against or
involving the Parent Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
a dispute arises after the Closing between Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including any Transferred Entity), on the one hand, and a third party other
than (and not an Affiliate of) a party to this Agreement, on the other hand,
a Transferred Entity may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by Parent Groups Counsel to such
third party; provided, however, that such Transferred Entity may not waive
such privilege without the prior written consent of Parent. Purchaser
acknowledges that it has consulted with independent counsel of its own
choosing with respect to the meaning and effect of this _Section_ __ _
11.15_. Parent Groups Counsel is an express intended third party beneficiary
of this Agreement for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 11.15_, and may enforce
the same. This _Section_ __ _ 11.15_ will survive the Closing and will
remain in effect indefinitely.
