upon the written request of the Company), (ii) make any change in the terms of
or conditions to the Offer that (A) changes the form or amount of
consideration to be paid in the Offer ( _provided, however_ that, Purchaser

no event shall such increase reduce the Exchange Ratio or the Per Share Cash
Amount and provided that such increase is not for the primary purpose of
delaying the Acceptance Time), (B) decrease the number of shares of Company

fractional shares (after aggregating all shares of Company Stock validly
tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in the Offer by such holder) shall be
entitled to an amount in cash, without interest, rounded to the nearest cent,
equal to the product of (A) the amount of the fractional share interest in a
share of Parent Stock to which such holder would, but for this  _Section
2.2_, be entitled pursuant to the Offer and (B) an amount equal to the average
of the volume weighted average price per share of Parent Stock on Nasdaq (as

Section 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the 1934 Act) after the date that the
Offer is first commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under
the 1934 Act) (which twenty (20) Business Days, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall include the date on which the Offer is first commenced). In the event
that the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement,
then the Offer shall expire on the date and at the time to which the Offer has

contrary set forth in this Agreement:

(i) Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) extend the Offer
for any period required by any Law, or any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC or its staff or the NYSE, in any such case, which is
applicable to the Offer or the Merger; and

 

(ii) if as of any then scheduled expiration of the Offer, in the event that
any of the conditions to the Offer (including the Minimum Condition) have not
been satisfied or waived in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ as of any then
scheduled expiration of the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) extend the Offer for successive extension periods of up to ten
(10) Business Days each in order to further seek the satisfaction of the
conditions to the Offer (including the Minimum Condition);

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , in each case that (1) any such extension shall not
be deemed to impair, limit, or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of
the Parties to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Section
10.1_ and (2) Purchaser shall not be permitted or required (and Parent shall
not be permitted or required to cause Purchaser) to extend the Offer beyond
the End Date other than (A) any such extension requested by the Company, to
the extent Parent or Purchaser would be prohibited from terminating this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)(i)_ or (B) any such
extension effected by Parent or Purchaser, to the extent the Company would be
prohibited from terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)(i)_.

 

(c) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall terminate or withdraw the Offer prior
to the then scheduled expiration of the Offer unless this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _Section 10.1_, in which case Purchaser
shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer promptly (but in no event more than one (1) Business Day)
after such termination of this Agreement. If the Offer is terminated or
withdrawn by Purchaser, or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Section 10.1, prior to the acceptance for payment of shares of Company Stock
tendered in the Offer, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to,
promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser
to return, all tendered shares of Company Stock to the registered holders
thereof.

conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) irrevocably accept for purchase and payment
all shares of Company Stock that are

 



19  validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in the Offer promptly after the
expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with _Section
2.3(b)_) and promptly thereafter pay for such shares. The time at which
Purchaser first irrevocably accepts for purchase and payment the shares of
Company Stock tendered in the Offer is referred to as the "Acceptance Time".
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall provide or
cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds and shares of
Parent Stock necessary to pay for any shares of Company Stock that Purchaser
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not
accept for payment, or pay for, any shares of Company Stock if, as a result,
Purchaser would acquire less than the number of shares of Company Stock
necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition. The Offer Consideration shall be
paid net to the holder of each share of Company Stock validly tendered (and
not validly withdrawn) in the Offer subject to reduction for any applicable
withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to register (and shall instruct its transfer agent to

and applicable Law.

Purchaser:

 

(a) All shares of Company Stock that are owned, directly or indirectly, by

Consideration (the "Merger Consideration"), subject to the provisions of this
_Article III_.

(c) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Stock converted into the

class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares,
readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend thereon shall
be declared with a record date within said period, then the Exchange Ratio and
any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide Parent and the holders of Company Stock
(including Company Stock Options exercisable for Company Stock) the same

Section 3.7 _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of

other rights of a holder of Parent Stock. All fractional shares to which a
single record holder of Company Stock would be otherwise entitled to receive
shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to three (3) decimal
places. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of Company Stock
who would otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be entitled to
an amount in cash, without interest, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the
product of (A) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of
Parent Stock to which such holder would, but for this _Section 3.7_, be

25  As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Company Stock in lieu of any fractional share
interests in Parent Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such
amounts, without interest, to the holders of Company Stock entitled to receive
such cash.

complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall
not be converted into the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.5_,
but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment by the
Surviving Corporation of the "fair value" of such Appraisal Shares in
accordance with Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holders Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to
have become exchangeable solely for, the Merger Consideration as provided in 
_Section 3.5_. The Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Stock,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to
Section 262 received by the Company. Parent shall have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a customary exchange
agreement with a nationally recognized financial institution designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), and
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company Stock, for exchange in accordance with this _Article III_ ,
through the Exchange Agent, subject to _Section 3.9(b)(ii)_, book-entry
shares (or certificates if requested) representing the full number of whole
shares of Parent Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 3.5_ in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Stock. At or immediately following the Effective
Time on the Closing Date, Parent shall provide or shall cause to be provided
to the Exchange Agent cash in an aggregate amount necessary to pay the cash
portion of the Merger Consideration, and Parent shall, after the Effective
Time on the appropriate payment date, if applicable, provide or cause to be
provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other distributions payable
on such shares of Parent Stock pursuant to _Section 3.9(c)_ which had not
theretofore been surrendered for exchange or been exchanged pursuant to
_Section 3.9(b)(ii)_ (such shares of Parent Stock and cash provided to the
Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or other distributions with
respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). For the
purposes of such deposit, Parent shall assume that there will not be any
fractional shares of Parent Stock. Parent shall make available to the Exchange
Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with 
_Section 3.7_. The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration to
be issued pursuant to _Section 3.5_ out of the Exchange Fund. Except as
provided in _Section 3.9(h)_, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose.

 



26 (b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later
than the fifth Business Day following the Closing Date, to each holder of
record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Stock were converted into the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.5_, (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in
exchange thereof as promptly as practicable, (A) cash in an amount equal to
the Per Share Cash Amount multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock
previously represented by such Certificate, (B) the number of shares of
Parent Stock (which shall be in book-entry form unless a certificate is
requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that
such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant
to  _Section 3.5(b)_ (after taking into account all other Certificates
surrendered by such holder pursuant to this _Section 3.9(b)(i)_), (C) any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.9(c)(i) _and
(D) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock payable pursuant to
_Section 3.7_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made
and shares may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required
by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on
any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this _Article III_. In lieu thereof, each holder
of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Stock were
converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.5_ shall
automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time, (A) cash in an amount equal to the Per Share Cash Amount
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock previously represented by
such Book-Entry Shares, (B) the number of shares of Parent Stock (which shall
be in book-entry form unless a certificate is requested) representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to
receive in respect of such Book-Entry Shares

 



27  pursuant to _Section 3.5(b)_ (after taking into account all other Book-
Entry Shares converted by such holder pursuant to this _Section 3.9(b)(ii)_),
(C) any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.9(c)(ii)_
and (D) cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section
3.7_, and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon conversion of
any Book-Entry Shares.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

(i) _Certificates_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any Certificate formerly representing Company Stock, and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
_Section 3.7_, until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
this _Article III_. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the shares of Parent
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of
delivery of such Parent Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section
3.9(b)(i)_, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of
Parent Stock and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to such delivery of such Parent Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to 
_Section 3.9(b)(i)_, and a payment date subsequent to such delivery of such
Parent Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 3.9(b)(i)_, payable
with respect to such shares of Parent Stock.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Subject to applicable Law, there shall be paid to
the holder of the shares of Parent Stock issued in exchange for Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with this _Article III_, without interest, (A) at the
time of delivery of such Parent Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 3.9(b)(ii)_, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
shares of Parent Stock and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to the time of such delivery by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 3.9(b)(ii)_, and a payment date subsequent to the time of such
delivery by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 3.9(b)(ii)_, payable
with respect to such shares of Parent Stock.

(d) The Merger Consideration issued and paid in accordance with the terms of
this  _Article III_ upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, immediately,
in the case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been issued and
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Stock (other than the right to receive dividends or other distributions, if
any, in accordance with _Section 3.9(c)_). After the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Stock are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

 



28 (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former
holders of Company Stock for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former holder of
Company Stock who has not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim
for the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect
to Parent Stock as contemplated by _Section 3.9(c)_.

 

(f) None of Parent, Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of
Parent Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger Consideration
remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Stock immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable and customary amount as Parent
or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends or
other distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to  _Section 3.9(c)_ had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
been surrendered as provided in this _Article III_.

 

(h) The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment income
or gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company
Stock. Any interest, gains and other income resulting from such investments
shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent upon its
request, and no part of such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to
the benefit of holders of Company Stock; _provided_ , _further_ , that any
investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1
or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank that are then publicly available), and that no such investment or loss
thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Stock pursuant
to this _Article III_. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall
promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to
the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash
payment obligations.

 



29 (i) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former
holder of Company Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. Any amount deducted or withheld pursuant to this _Section 3.9(i)_ and
paid over to the relevant Taxing Authority shall be treated as having been
paid to the holder of Company Stock in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made. Parent shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all amounts
so deducted or withheld to the appropriate Taxing Authority within the period
required under applicable Law.

 

Section 3.10 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall determine that any actions are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or Purchaser acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to take all
such actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or
interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 

Section 3.11 _Company Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_. Except as
expressly provided in this  _Section 3.11_, Parent shall not assume or
substitute any compensatory option to purchase shares of Company Stock (a
"Company Stock Option"), any compensatory restricted stock unit with respect
to shares of Company Stock (a "Company RSU") or any other outstanding equity
award.

(a) _Vested Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and action by the Company Board, without any action on the part of any
holder of any Company Stock Option and pursuant to the terms of the Companys
Amended and Restated 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2012 Equity Plan"),
each Vested Company Stock Option (other than Out-of-the-Money Vested Options)
shall be canceled, and the holder of such Vested Company Stock Option shall be
entitled to receive as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, but in
no event later than 15 days after the Closing Date, in full satisfaction of
the rights of such holder with respect thereto: an amount in cash, paid in
United States Dollars, equal to the product of (i) the excess (if any) of (A)
the Equity Award Cash Consideration, less (B) the exercise price per share of
Company Stock subject to such Vested Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii)
the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Vested Company Stock
Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Vested Company Stock Option for
which (B) is equal to or greater than (A) pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence ("Out-of-the-Money Vested Options") shall, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and action by the Company Board,
without any action on the part of any holder of any Company Stock Option and
pursuant to the terms of the 2012 Equity Plan, be canceled, and the holder of
such Out-of-the-Money Vested Options shall be entitled to receive a
replacement award of options ("Replaced Vested Options") pursuant to the terms
and conditions of a Parent equity plan with terms and conditions substantially
similar to Parents 2009 Stock Plan (the "2009 Stock Plan") and applicable
grant agreement, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with
respect thereto. The exercise price and number of shares of Parent Stock
covered by such Replaced Vested Options shall be determined in accordance
with the following: (A) such Replaced Vested Options will be exercisable for
that number of whole shares of Parent Stock equal to the product of the
number 

 



30  of shares of Company Stock that were issuable on exercise of such Out-of-
the-Money Vested Options immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares
of Parent Stock and (B) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent
Stock issuable upon exercise of such Replaced Vested Option shall be equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of Company
Stock at which the applicable Out-of-the-Money Vested Options were exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded
up to the nearest whole cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent
that Parent determines, in its sole discretion, that there are impediments
under applicable Laws to issuing Replaced Vested Options, in lieu of the
treatment described above, Parent may instead provide the holder of such Out-
of-the-Money Vested Option a cash payment in United States Dollars equal to
the Black Scholes Option Value for such Out-of-the-Money Vested Option as soon
as practicable following the Closing, but in no event later than fifteen (15)
days after the Closing Date.

(b) _Unvested Company Stock Options_. Each Company Stock Option that is not
vested by its terms as of immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Unvested
Company Stock Option") with respect to which (A) the Equity Award Cash
Consideration, less (B) the exercise price per share of Company Stock subject
to such Unvested Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time is a positive number (the "In-the-Money Unvested
Options") shall be canceled, and the holder of such Unvested Company Stock
Option shall be entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of
such holder with respect thereto an award of Parent restricted stock units
("Replaced RSU") relating to the number of shares of Parent Stock equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing the Parent Stock Price into the amount by which
(A) the Equity Award Cash Consideration, less (B) the exercise price per share
of Company Stock subject to such Unvested Company Stock Option, multiplied by
(ii) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Unvested Company
Stock Option, with any fractional shares otherwise subject to the Replaced RSU
being rounded down to the next whole number of shares. Such Replaced RSU will
be subject to vesting over the same time period as was applicable under such
Unvested Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time with
such remaining vesting term being applied proportionally to the Replaced RSU
and will otherwise be subject to the terms and conditions of a Parent equity
plan with terms and conditions substantially similar to the 2009 Stock Plan
and the applicable grant agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
extent that Parent determines, in its sole discretion, that there are
impediments under applicable Laws to issuing Replaced RSUs, in lieu of the
treatment described above, Parent may instead issue, in full satisfaction of
the rights of such holder with respect thereto, a contingent right to receive
an amount in cash in United States Dollars, equal to the product of (i) the
excess of (A) the Equity Award Cash Consideration, less (B) the exercise price
per share of Company Stock subject to such Unvested Company Stock Option,
multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such
Unvested Company Stock Option, subject to the same vesting schedule as applied
to such Unvested Company Stock Option and otherwise subject to the terms and
conditions of the applicable Parent grant agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Unvested Company Stock Option for which (A) the Equity Award
Cash Consideration, less (B) the exercise price per share of Company Stock
subject to such Unvested Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time is not a positive number (the "Out-of-the-Money
Unvested Options") shall, effective as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and action by the Company Board, without any action on the part of any
holder of any Company Stock Option and pursuant to the terms of the

 



31  2012 Equity Plan, be canceled, and the holder of such Out-of-the-Money
Unvested Options shall be entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the
rights of such holder with respect thereto, a replacement award of options
("Replaced Unvested Options") pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Parent
equity plan with terms and conditions substantially similar to Parents 2009
Stock Plan and applicable grant agreement, in full satisfaction of the rights
of such holder with respect thereto. The exercise price and number of shares
of Parent Stock covered by such Replaced Unvested Options shall be determined
in accordance with the following: (A) such Replaced Unvested Options will be
exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Stock equal to the
product of the number of shares of Company Stock that were issuable on
exercise of such Out-of-the-Money Unvested Options immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded down to
the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Stock and (B) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Parent Stock issuable upon exercise of such
Replaced Unvested Options shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
the exercise price per share of Company Stock at which the applicable Out-of-
the-Money Unvested Options were exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Any
such Replaced Unvested Options will be subject to vesting over the same time
period as was applicable under such Unvested Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time with such remaining vesting term being applied
proportionally to the Replaced Unvested Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
to the extent that Parent determines, in its sole discretion, that there are
impediments under applicable Laws to issuing Replaced Unvested Options, in
lieu of the treatment described above, Parent may instead issue, in full
satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, a contingent
right to receive an amount in cash in United States Dollars equal to
the Black-Scholes Option Value for such Out-of-the-Money Unvested Option,
subject to the same vesting schedule as applied to such Out-of-the-Money
Unvested Option and otherwise subject to the terms and conditions of the
applicable Parent grant agreement.

(c) _Unvested Time-Based Company RSUs_. Each Company RSU that is subject
solely to a time-based vesting condition and is outstanding and unvested
immediately prior to the Effective Time and does not vest by its terms at the
Effective Time (an "Unvested Company Time-Based RSU") shall be canceled, and
the holder of such Unvested Company Time-Based RSU shall be entitled to
receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect
thereto, a Parent restricted stock unit with the same vesting terms) as were
applicable under such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
and relating to the number of shares of Parent Stock equal to the product of
(i) the Equity Award Cash Consideration divided by (y) the Parent Stock Price
(the "Equity Award Exchange Ratio"), multiplied by (ii) the number of shares
of Company Stock subject to such Unvested Company Time-Based RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time, with any fractional shares rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares. Each Parent restricted stock unit granted
pursuant to this _Section 3.11(c)_ will be subject to the terms and
conditions of a Parent equity plan with terms and conditions substantially
similar to Parents 2009 Stock Plan and the applicable grant agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Parent determines, in its
sole discretion, that there are impediments under applicable Laws to issuing
Parent restricted stock units to a holder of Unvested Company Time-Based RSUs,
in lieu of the treatment described above, Parent may instead issue, in full
satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, a contingent
right to receive an amount in cash in United States Dollars equal to the
Equity Award Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company
Stock subject to such Unvested

 



32  Company Time-Based RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to
the same vesting schedule as applied to the applicable Unvested Company Time-
Based RSU and otherwise subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable
Parent grant agreement.

(d) _Unvested Performance-Based Company RSUs_. Each Company RSU that is
subject to a performance-based vesting condition and is outstanding and
unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time and does not vest by its
terms at the Effective Time (an "Unvested Company Performance-Based RSU")
shall be canceled, and the holder of such Unvested Company Performance-Based
RSU shall be entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such
holder with respect thereto, a Parent restricted stock unit with the same
vesting time vesting schedule, but without any performance conditions as
applied to such Unvested Company Performance-Based RSU immediately prior to
the Effective Time and relating to the number of shares of Parent Stock equal
to the product of (i) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio multiplied by (ii) the
target number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Unvested Company
Performance-Based RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, with any
fractional shares rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares. Each
Parent restricted stock unit granted pursuant to this _Section 3.11(d)_ will
be granted under and subject to the terms and conditions of a Parent equity
plan with terms and conditions substantially similar to Parents 2009
Stock Plan and the applicable grant agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
to the extent that Parent determines, in its sole discretion, that there are
impediments under applicable Laws to issuing Parent restricted stock units to
a holder of Unvested Company Performance-Based RSUs, Parent may instead
issue, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto,
a contingent right to receive an amount in cash in United States Dollars equal
to the Equity Award Cash Consideration multiplied by the target number of
shares of Company Stock subject to such Unvested Company Performance-Based RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the same vesting schedule
but without any performance conditions as applied to the applicable Unvested
Company Performance-Based RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and
otherwise be subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Parent
grant agreement.

 

(e) _Withholding_. The Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to _Section
3.11 _such amounts as are required or permitted to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under any state, local or foreign
Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the applicable equity
award in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

(f) _Purchase Rights_. There shall be no outstanding Purchase Rights, as that
term is defined under the Companys 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"2012 ESPP"), that are outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(g) _Parent Actions_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take
such actions as are necessary for the conversion of the Unvested Company
Stock Options and Unvested Company RSUs pursuant to this _Section 3.11_,
including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Stock as is
necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this  _Section
3.11_. Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
an

 



33  appropriate form, or a post-effective amendment to a registration statement
previously filed under the 1933 Act, with respect to the shares of Parent
Stock subject to Adjusted Stock Awards. With respect to those individuals, if
any, who, subsequent to the Effective Time, will be subject to the reporting
requirements under Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act, where applicable, Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to administer any Adjusted Stock Awards
in a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act to
the extent such Adjusted Stock Award complied with such rule prior to the
Merger.

 

(h) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) take such actions with respect to the
Companys equity compensation plans or arrangements as are necessary to give
effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section 3.11_ and (ii)
satisfy all applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the
1934 Act.

(i) _Share Reserve Assumption_. As of the Effective Date, Parent shall assume
such portion of the available Company Stock share reserve under the 2012
Equity Plan as will, when taken together with the aggregate number of shares
of Parent Stock to be issued in respect of shares of Company Stock accepted
for purchase by Purchaser pursuant to  _Section 2.1(a)_ and in connection
with the Merger pursuant to _Section 3.5_ and the aggregate number of shares
of Parent Stock underlying Parent equity awards issued in replacement of
Company equity awards pursuant to  _Section 3.11_, not to exceed an amount
equal to 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Parent Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time, as may be permitted pursuant to
Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635. To the extent that treatment of the outstanding
equity awards as provided in this _Section 3.11_ would cause such 19.9%
number to be exceeded, then, instead of the default treatment outlined above,
equity awards shall instead be treated as if Parent had concluded that there
are impediments under applicable Laws to such default treatment (the
"Alternative Cash Treatment") in the following order: (1) Out-of-the-Money
Vested Options; (2) Out-of-the-Money Unvested Options; (3) In-the-Money
Unvested Options; (4) Unvested Company Time-Based RSUs; and (5) Unvested
Company Performance-Based RSUs, with the methodology for determining which
equity awards in each such tranche will receive the Alternative
Cash Treatment to be determined by Parent.

(j) _Ancillary Agreements_. To the extent a holder of an equity award
described in this  _Section 3.11_ enters into a written agreement with
Parent providing for treatment inconsistent with the treatment in this
_Section 3.11_, such other written agreement shall prevail over this _Section
3.11_ with respect to such holder.

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Subject to _Section 11.5_, (a) except as disclosed in the Company SEC
Documents publicly filed prior to the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
that in no event shall any risk factor disclosure under the heading "Risk
Factors" or disclosure set forth in any "forward looking statements"
disclaimer or other general statements to the extent they are cautionary,
predictive or forward looking in nature that are included in any part of any
Company SEC Document be deemed to be an exception to, or, as applicable,
disclosure for purposes of, any representations 

 



34  and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement or (b) except as
set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company represents and
warrants to Parent and Purchaser that:

 

Section 4.1 _Corporate Existence and Power_. The Company is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware. The Company has all corporate power and authority to carry
on its business as now conducted and is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such
qualification is necessary, except where any failure to have such power or
authority or to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected, individually
or in the aggregate, (i) to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (ii) to
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Offer or the
Merger. Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has delivered or
made available to Parent true and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of this
Agreement. The Company is not in violation of, in conflict with, or in default
under, its certificate of incorporation or bylaws.

Section 4.2 _Corporate Authorization_. The execution, delivery and performance
by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby are within the Companys corporate power and
authority and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of the Company. Assuming the applicability of Section 251(h) of the
DGCL to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, no vote of the
holders of shares of Company Stock or other capital stock of the Company is
necessary to adopt this Agreement and consummate the Merger under applicable
Law or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company. This
Agreement, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and
Purchaser, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law).

(i) there were issued and outstanding (A) 90,062,345 shares of Company Stock,

compensation plan or arrangement will be, when issued in accordance with the
respective terms thereof, duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. No Subsidiary of the Company owns

securities or other ownership interests), in each case other than (x)

appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves are being maintained
in accordance with GAAP, (y) transfer and other restrictions under applicable
federal and state securities Laws and (z) in the case of Subsidiaries that

principal financial officer by others within those entities, particularly

fashion to the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial
officer such that timely decisions may be made regarding the disclosure of

required by Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the 1934 Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated
by the SEC and the NYSE, and the statements contained in any such
certifications are complete and correct in all material respects.

(a) The Company and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries are the sole owners of
each item of material Owned Intellectual Property Rights and material Owned
Technology, free and clear of any Liens, except for Permitted Liens. As of the

is subject to any outstanding injunction, judgment, order, decree or

which the Company has received written notice is pending before any court or

Property Rights or Owned Technology, as applicable, which remains unresolved
as of the date hereof. _Section 4.15(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
contains a complete and accurate list, as of the date hereof, of (i) all

no restrictions on the transfer or assignment by the Company or its

rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under such Inbound
Intellectual Property

 



43  Contract. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will, as a result
of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the performance of the
Companys and each of its Subsidiaries obligations hereunder, lose any
material rights to Exploit any Licensed Intellectual Property Rights or
Licensed Technology pursuant to any Inbound Intellectual Property Contract. As
of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has

Intellectual Property Contract intends to cancel, terminate or refuse to renew
(if renewable) such Inbound Intellectual Property Contract, or to exercise or
decline to exercise any option or right thereunder. _Section 4.15(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete and accurate list of all (i)

and in full force and effect. There are no restrictions on the transfer or
assignment by the Company or its Subsidiaries of any Outbound Intellectual
Property Contract required to be listed on _Section 4.15(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter which would cause the Offer or the Merger (or any related
transactions) to impair any rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under such Outbound Intellectual Property Contract. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries will, as a result of the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the performance of the Companys and each of its
Subsidiaries obligations hereunder, lose any material rights to Exploit any
Owned Intellectual Property Rights or Owned Technology pursuant to any
Outbound Intellectual Property Contract. As of the date hereof, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice, or has any knowledge
(without any obligation of due inquiry), that any party to any material

Contract, or to exercise or decline to exercise any option or right
thereunder. _Section 4.15(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a
complete and accurate list of all Outbound Intellectual Property Contracts
(other than Ordinary Course Customer Agreements) (i) with any industry

Rights or Technology by the Company or any its Subsidiaries, including any
obligations to license such Intellectual Property Rights or Technology on a
royalty-free, RAND or FRAND basis; (ii) pursuant to which any material source
code included in the Owned Technology or included in any other material
Technology used in or incorporated in any Company Product is licensed or
otherwise made available to any other Person (other than to current or former
employees within the scope of their employment or independent contractors
acting for the benefit and account of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
in each case, solely during the time period that they are employed or engaged
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or that include any provision for

in respect of the Companys and its Subsidiaries rights to own, use, and/or

inquiry) of any attempted violation or breach of any information technology

Fargo Securities, LLC, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc., SunTrust Bank and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. (the
"Commitment Letter") and (ii) the fee letter, dated as of April 3, 2016, among
Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Wells Fargo Securities,
LLC, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.,
SunTrust Bank and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. (as redacted in a customary
manner to remove the fee amounts, pricing caps, the rates and amounts included
in the "market flex" and certain other 

 



64  terms (none of which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
conditionality, enforceability, termination or aggregate principal amount of
the Financing (other than in respect of upfront fees)), the "Redacted Fee
Letter"), in each case, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and
amendments to such letters in effect as of the date of this Agreement
(collectively, the "Debt Letters"), pursuant to which and subject to the
terms and conditions thereof each of the parties thereto (other than Parent)
have severally committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Parent (the
provision of such funds as set forth therein, but subject to the provisions
of _Section 8.3_, the "Financing") for the purposes set forth in such Debt
Letters. As of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Debt Letters
have not been amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived and the
respective commitments contained in the Debt Letters have not been withdrawn,
rescinded, amended, restated or otherwise modified in any respect. As of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Debt Letters are in full force
and effect and constitute the legal, valid, enforceable and binding
obligations of each of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other
parties thereto, subject in each case to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting generally the enforcement
of creditors rights and subject to general principles of equity. As of the
date of this Agreement, there are no conditions precedent or contingencies
related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing pursuant to the
Debt Letters, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Letters. Subject
to the terms and conditions of the Debt Letters, the net proceeds contemplated
from the Financing, together with other financial resources of Parent,
including contemplated cash on hand of Parent, will, in the aggregate, be
sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parents obligations under this
Agreement, including the payment of the Offer Consideration and the Merger
Consideration and all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in
connection therewith. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ , no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent under the Debt Letters
or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party to the Debt Letters. As of the
date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or other agreements,
Contracts or arrangements related to the Financing or the funding of all or
any part of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Letters. Parent has fully paid all commitment fees or other fees required to
be paid on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the
Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ , Parent has no reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied, nor
does Parent have knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, that the full
amount of the Financing will not be made available to Parent as of the time at
which the Acceptance Time is required to occur pursuant to _Section 2.4_ in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Letters.

 

Section 5.10 _Absence of Certain Changes_.

 

(a) From the Parent Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement, the
business of Parent and its Subsidiaries has been conducted in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice in all material respects.

(b) Since the Parent Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement,
there has not been any effect, change, condition, fact, event, occurrence or
development that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



65 Section 5.11 _Solvency_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will
be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Solvent", when used
with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (a)
the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as
of such date, exceed the sum of (1) the value of all "liabilities of such
Person, including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such
quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws
governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (2) the amount that
will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person, as of such
date, on its existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as
such debts become absolute and mature, (b) such Person will not have, as of
such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such
date, and (c) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, as of such
date, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For
purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital
for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will
be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become
due. 

Section 5.12 _No Undisclosed Material Liabilities_. There are no liabilities
or obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that would be required by
GAAP, as in effect on the date hereof, to be reflected on the consolidated
balance sheet of Parent (including the notes thereto), other than:

 

(a) liabilities or obligations disclosed, reflected, reserved against or
otherwise provided for in the Parent Balance Sheet or in the notes thereto;

(b) liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
since the Parent Balance Sheet Date;

 

(c) liabilities or obligations arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; and

 

(d) liabilities or obligations that have not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 5.13 _Compliance with Laws and Court Orders; Governmental
Authorization_.

 

(a) Except for matters that have not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, (i) a Parent Material Adverse
Effect or (ii) an effect that would prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the ability of Parent to perform its obligations under this Agreement
or to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
is and since February 1, 2013 has been in compliance with all applicable Laws

 



66  (including with respect to applicable anti-corruption Laws) and Orders, and
to the knowledge of Parent, is not under investigation by any Governmental
Authority with respect to any Law (including with respect to applicable anti-
corruption Laws) or Order. There is no Order of any Governmental Authority
outstanding against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that is material to
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, (x) a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (y) an effect that would
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent or
Purchaser to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement or to
consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has
all Governmental Authorizations necessary for the ownership and operation of
its business as presently conducted, and each such Governmental Authorization
is in full force and effect. Except as would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
(i) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is and since February 1, 2013, has
been in compliance with the terms of all Governmental Authorizations necessary
for the ownership and operation of its businesses and (ii) since February 1,
2013, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice
from any Governmental Authority alleging any conflict with or breach of any
such Governmental Authorization.

Section 5.14 _Litigation_. Except as has not had and would not reasonably
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, (x) a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or (y) an effect that would prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of Parent or Purchaser to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Offer or the
Merger, there is no Proceeding or, to the knowledge of Parent, investigation,
pending against, or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened by or against,
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of Parent and insofar as
any such Proceeding or investigation relates to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, any present or former officer, director, worker or employee of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person for whom Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries may be liable before (or, in the case of threatened
Proceedings or investigations, that would be before) or by any Governmental
Authority.

 

Section 5.15 _Share Ownership_. None of Parent, Purchaser or any of their
respective controlled Affiliates beneficially owns (as such term is used in
Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act) any Company Stock or any options,
warrants or other rights to acquire Company Stock or other securities of, or
any other economic interest (through derivatives, securities or otherwise) in
the Company.

Section 5.16 _No Additional Representations_. Except for the representations
and warranties expressly made by Parent and Purchaser in this _Article V_,
the Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Purchaser or any other Person
makes any express or implied representation or warranty whatsoever and
specifically (but without limiting the foregoing), that none of Parent,
Purchaser or any of their Representatives makes any representation or warranty
with respect to (a) Parent or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
businesses, affairs, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial
or otherwise), prospects or any other matter relating to Parent or its
Subsidiaries or (b) any documentation, forecasts, budgets, projections,
estimates or other information (including the accuracy or completeness of, or
the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying, such documentation,
forecasts, budgets, projections, estimates or other information) provided by
Parent or any Representative of Parent, including in any "data rooms"
or management presentations.

action (or omission) would reasonably be expected to result in a requirement
to seek the approval by holders of Parent Stock of the transactions
contemplated hereby; or

 

(h) agree, resolve or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 

Section 7.2 _Obligations of Purchaser_. Parent shall cause Purchaser to
perform when due its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Offer and the Merger pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and the Offer.

 

Section 7.3 _Approval by Sole Stockholder of Purchaser_. Immediately following
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Parties, Parent, as sole
stockholder of Purchaser, shall adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger,
in accordance with the DGCL, by written consent.

 



73 Section 7.4 _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Acceptance Time, Parent and Purchaser agree that,
subject to applicable Law, all rights to indemnification of each former and
present director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each,
together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, a "Company
Indemnified Party") with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) as in effect
on the date of this Agreement or in any agreement, a true and complete copy of
which agreement has been provided by the Company to Parent prior to the date
of this Agreement, to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
which is in effect as of the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger
and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) honor all the terms thereof. For a period of no less than six (6) years
after the Effective Time, Parent, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, shall cause to be maintained in effect the provisions in the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws and comparable organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary of the Company (or
in such documents of any successor thereto) regarding indemnification,
exculpation and expense advancement in effect as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and, during such six (6) year period, shall not amend, repeal
or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any individual who immediately before the
Acceptance Time was a Company Indemnified Party, except as required by
applicable Law.

 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving
Corporation hereby agrees, to either (i) continue to maintain in effect for a
period of no less than six (6) years after the Effective Time the Companys
directors and officers insurance policies (the "DandO Insurance") in place as
of the date of this Agreement or (ii) purchase comparable DandO Insurance (from
a carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys DandO Insurance
carrier) for such six (6)-year period, in each case, with coverage for the
persons who are covered by the Companys existing DandO Insurance, with terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable to the
insured individuals as the Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect to
matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that
in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend
for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess
of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal
year, which amount is set forth in _Section 7.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter (the "Premium Cap"); _provided further_ , that if the amount necessary
to procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Premium Cap, the Company may
purchase the most advantageous policy available for an amount not to exceed
the Premium Cap. At the Companys option, the Company may purchase, prior to
the Effective Time, a prepaid "tail policy" for a period of no more than six
(6) years after the Effective Time with coverage for the persons who are
covered by the Companys existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable to the insured
individuals as the Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters
existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, in which event Parent shall
cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this _Section
7.4(b)_; _provided_ , that the aggregate premium for such policies shall not
exceed the Premium Cap; _provided further_ , that if the amount of annual
premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the
Premium Cap, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall procure and maintain
for such six-year period the most advantageous policy available for an annual
premium equal to the Premium Cap. In the 

 



74  event the Company elects to purchase such a "tail policy," the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain such "tail policy" in full force and effect for a period of no less
than six (6) years after the Effective Time and continue to honor its
obligations thereunder.

 

(c) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties, rights and other assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Parent shall cause the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to succeed to or assume the
applicable obligations of such Party set forth in this _Section 7.4_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.4_ shall survive consummation of the
Merger, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each of the Company Indemnified Parties and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by Contract, at Law or otherwise.

 

Section 7.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Stock to be issued as part of the Offer
Consideration and the Merger Consideration to be approved for listing on
Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Acceptance Time.

 

Section 7.6 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that each Continuing Employee (other than any Continuing
Employee covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement) shall, during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of
the Effective Time (the "Continuation Period"), be provided with (1) base
salary or base wage that is no less favorable than the base salary or base
wage provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to each such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (2) retirement and
health and welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (for this purpose including
the Company 401(k) Plan that is being terminated in connection with the
Closing)). In addition to the foregoing, Parent agrees that, during the
Continuation Period, Parent shall either (i) continue the agreements covering
Non-U.S. Service Providers on terms that are substantially comparable in all
respects to the agreements as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, or (ii) to the extent that Parent elects to hire any such Non-U.S.
Service Provider, Parent shall provide each such Non-U.S. Service Provider
with base compensation, incentive opportunities and employee benefits that
are substantially comparable to the base compensation, incentive
opportunities and employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees
of Parent;

 

(b) Parent shall give each Continuing Employee and Non-U.S. Service Provider
service credit for such Continuing Employees employment with (and Non-U.S.
Service Providers service to) the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes
of vesting, benefit accrual, level of benefit and eligibility to participate
under each applicable Parent benefit plan, as if such 

 



75  service had been performed with Parent (including, for purposes of
determining vacation, other paid time off and severance benefits), except for
benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans, for purposes of
qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent it would
result in a duplication of benefits. For purposes of this Section 7.6,
"Continuing Employee" means each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries
at the Effective Time, who continues to be employed with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries immediately after the Closing Date.

 

(c) Upon the written request of Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, effective as of immediately prior to Closing Date and
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, the Company shall terminate or
shall cause the termination of any or all U.S. tax qualified defined
contribution plans provided to Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
to the extent directed by Parent and in compliance with applicable Law (each
plan so terminated, a "Company Qualified Plan").

 

(d) As soon as possible following the execution of this Agreement, the Company
shall make commercially reasonable efforts to provide Parent with copies of
all material documents embodying and relating to each Foreign Company Plan,
including the Foreign Company Plan document, all amendments thereto and all
related trust documents, the most recent summary plan description, the most
recent actuarial valuation report, and the most recent tax return filing, in
each case, to the extent applicable.

(e) Parent agrees that the individuals listed on _Section 7.6(e)(i)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter will be eligible to receive severance benefits in
accordance with the Companys Severance Benefit Plan and their individual
Participation Notices as in effect on March 1, 2016 and the terms and
conditions thereof during the 12 months following the Effective Time.
Continuing Employees and Non-U.S. Service Providers who never had an
individual Participation Notice in connection with the Companys Severance
Benefit Plan shall be eligible to receive severance benefits as provided in
_Section 7.6(e)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.6_, expressed or implied, shall (i)
be treated as the establishment, amendment or modification of any Company
Plan or constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify, merge or terminate
after the Effective Time any Company Plan, (ii) give any Employee, director,
independent contractor, or other service provider (including Non-U.S. Service
Providers) of the Company or its Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof), or any labor organization, union, works council, employee
association, trade union, other similar employee representative body,
any third-party beneficiary or other rights or (iii) obligate Parent or any
of its Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular Company Plan or any Parent
plan or (B) retain the employment or services of any Employee, director,
other independent contractor or other service provider (including Non-U.S.
Service Providers) of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

Section 8.1 _Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company
and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate

applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, including (i) preparing and

advisable filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions
of information, applications and other documents and (ii) obtaining and
maintaining all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations
and other confirmations required to be obtained from any Governmental
Authority or other Third Party that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether or not such
approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations are conditions to the consummation of the Offer pursuant to
_Annex A_ or the Merger pursuant to  _Article IX_); _provided_ that no Party
shall be required to pay any consideration therefor other than filing fees and
other regulatory payments.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall make, as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any
event within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition,
Parent and Company shall make any filing that may be required under the
Competition Law of any jurisdiction identified on Section A of the Company
Disclosure Letter within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof. Each of
the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to supply as
promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be reasonably requested pursuant to the foregoing, and use its
reasonable best efforts to take all other actions necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods regarding the
foregoing as soon as reasonably practicable. The Company and Parent will each
request early termination of the waiting period with respect to the
Merger under the HSR Act.

(c) Except as prohibited by applicable Law or Order, each of Parent and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) cooperate with each
other in connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (B) promptly
inform the other Party of (and if in writing, supply to the other Party)
any communication (other than any ministerial communications) received by
such Party from, or given by such Party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any other similar
Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (C) consult with each
other prior to taking any material position with respect to the filings under
the HSR Act or any other Competition Law in discussions with or filings to be
submitted to any Governmental Authority, (D) permit the other to review and
discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in
connection

 



77  with, any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals to be submitted to any Governmental Authority with respect to
filings under the HSR Act or any other Competition Law, and (E) coordinate
with the other in preparing and exchanging such information and promptly
provide the other (and its counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations
or submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) made by such Party
with any Governmental Authority relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or any other Competition Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent shall, on
behalf of the Parties, have control over and lead all communications and
strategy relating to obtaining all approvals, consents, waivers,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations under any
Competition Law from any Governmental Authority or other Third Party in
connection with consummating the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as it relates to Competition Laws or to any
litigation under any Competition Law arising therefrom;  _provided, however_
, that Parent shall consult in good faith with the Company and its counsel
regarding the foregoing and shall in good faith take into account the views of
the Company and the Companys counsel. Notwithstanding the foregoing, matters
relating to the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Registration
Statement shall be governed by _Section 2.5_ and _Section 2.6_ and not this
_Section 8.1(c)_.

 

(d) Unless prohibited by applicable Law or Order or by the applicable
Governmental Authority, each of the Company and Parent shall (i) to the
extent reasonably practicable, not participate in or attend any meeting, or
engage in any conversation (other than ministerial conversations) with any
Governmental Authority in respect of the Offer or the Merger (including with
respect to any of the actions referred to in _Section 8.1(a)_ but other than
as contemplated by _Section 2.5_ and _Section 2.6_) without the other, (ii)
to the extent reasonably practicable, give the other reasonable prior notice
of any such meeting or conversation and (iii) in the event one such Party is
prohibited by applicable Law or Order or by the applicable Governmental
Authority from participating or attending any such meeting or engaging in any
such conversation, keep the non-participating Party reasonably apprised with
respect thereto.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
will Parent be obligated (i) to propose or agree to accept any undertaking or
condition, (ii) to enter into any consent decree, to make any divestiture,
(iii) to accept any operational restriction, or (iv) to take any other action
that, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, could be expected to limit the
rights of Parent with respect to any product lines or assets of Parent or the
Company.

 

Section 8.2 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its
controlled Affiliates, and shall direct and use reasonable best efforts to
cause each of its, its Subsidiaries and its controlled Affiliates
Representatives, to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions, activities or negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing
with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal (including terminating access
to any physical or electronic data rooms relating to a possible Company
Acquisition Proposal) and, if applicable, shall request each Person that has
heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with a possible
Company Acquisition Proposal to have returned to the Company or destroyed any
confidential information that has been provided to any Person in any such
discussions or 

 



78  negotiations occurring in the twelve (12) months prior to the date of this
Agreement (other than such confidential information that may be retained
pursuant to the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement). From and
after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Acceptance
Time and the date of termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article
X_, subject to _Section 8.2(b)_, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit
any of its Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates to, nor shall it authorize or
knowingly permit any of its officers, directors or employees or any investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other Representative
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to (and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause such Persons not to), directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate, support, knowingly induce or knowingly encourage (including by way
of furnishing information which has not been previously publicly
disseminated), or take any other action with the intent to facilitate, any
inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or offer which constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
subject to this _Section 8.2(a)_ and _Section 8.2(b)_, approve, endorse or
recommend, or authorize any public statement approving, endorsing or
recommending, or execute or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement or other agreement,
arrangement, or Contract relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (each an "Alternative
Acquisition Agreement"), (iii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Company Acquisition Proposal,
(iv) furnish to any Person (other than Parent, its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives) any non-public information or data relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in connection with, or with the intent of
encouraging or facilitating a Company Acquisition Proposal or that could
reasonably be expected to be used for the purposes of any Company Acquisition
Proposal, (v) submit any Company Acquisition Proposal to a vote of the
stockholders of the Company, or (vi) agree or publicly propose to do any of
the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, prior to the Acceptance Time,
following the receipt of a bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal that
was unsolicited and made after the date of this Agreement that did not result
from a material breach of this _Section 8.2_, that the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (A) is or could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) failure to take such
action would reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, then the Company may,
in response to such Company Acquisition Proposal, furnish information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Person or group (or
any of their Representatives) making such Company Acquisition Proposal and
engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group and their
Representatives regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that
(A) prior to furnishing, or causing to be furnished, any nonpublic information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such Person or group or
their respective Representatives, the Company enters into a confidentiality
agreement with the Person or group making such Company Acquisition Proposal
(an "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement") that (x) does not contain any
provision that would prevent the Company from complying with its obligation to
provide any disclosure to Parent required pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ and
(y) contains provisions that in the aggregate are no less restrictive on such
Person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement as in effect
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (provided that any such
agreement need not contain any "standstill" or similar provisions), and (B)
substantially concurrently with (but not more than twenty-four (24) hours
after) furnishing any such nonpublic

 



79  information to such Person, the Company furnishes such nonpublic information
to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously so
furnished to Parent or its Representatives). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries and the
Companys Representatives may in any event (A) seek to clarify the terms and
conditions of any bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal solely to
determine whether such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) inform a Person
or group that has made or, to the knowledge of the Company, is considering
making, a Company Acquisition Proposal of the provisions of this _Section
8.2(a)_.

(b) Except as permitted pursuant to this _Section 8.2(b)_, the Company Board
shall not (x) effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (y) cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change (and, in the case of a Company
Acquisition Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
10.1(d)(ii)_ and concurrently pay the fees required by _Section 10.3_ in
order to enter into a definitive agreement in connection with a Superior
Proposal) if (and only if): (I) (A) a bona fide written Company Acquisition
Proposal that was not solicited in violation of _Section 8.2_ is made to the
Company after the date of this Agreement by a Third Party and such Company
Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn prior to such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (B) there has been an Intervening Event; (II) in the
case of a Company Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal; and (III) the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to making any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or entering into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement,
(i) the Company Board shall provide Parent at least four (4) Business Days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
include, as applicable, (a) the information with respect to the Superior
Proposal that is specified in _Section 8.2(c)_, as well as a copy of such
Company Acquisition Proposal, or (b) the facts and circumstances in reasonable
detail of the Intervening Event; (ii) during the four (4) Business Days
following such written notice (or such shorter period as is specified below),
the Company Board and its Representatives have negotiated in good faith with
Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding any revisions to
the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby proposed by Parent in
response to such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable; and
(C) at the end of the four (4) Business Day period described in the foregoing
clause (ii), the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors (and
taking into account any legally binding (if accepted by the Company)
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing
by Parent), that, as applicable (a) the Company Acquisition Proposal continues
to be a Superior Proposal or (b) the Intervening Event continues to warrant a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and in each case, that failure to take
such action would reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws. Any
material amendment or modification to any Superior Proposal will be deemed to
be a new Company Acquisition Proposal for

 



80  purposes of this _Section 8.2_, and the Company shall promptly (but in any
event within one (1) Business Day of any such occurrence) notify Parent of any
such new Company Acquisition Proposal and the Parties shall comply with the
provisions of this _Section 8.2(b)_ with respect thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the period during which the Company Board and its
Representatives are required to negotiate in good faith with Parent regarding
any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to
such new Company Acquisition Proposal pursuant to clause (ii) above shall
expire on the later to occur of two (2) Business Days after the Company Board
provides written notice of such new Company Acquisition Proposal to Parent and
the end of the original four (4) Business Day period described in clause (ii)
above; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event there is a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change made in compliance with this _Section 8.2(b)_ with
respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall only enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect thereto by terminating this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.1(d)(ii) _(including paying any fees
pursuant to _Section 10.3_).

 

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company and Parent set forth in
_Section 8.2(a)_ and _Section 8.2(b)_, the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within one (1) Business Day) advise Parent orally and in writing of
any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to a Company Acquisition
Proposal that are received by, or any non-public information with regard to
such Company Acquisition Proposal that is requested from, or any discussions
or negotiations sought to be initiated regarding such Company Acquisition
Proposal with, the Company (or to the knowledge of the Company, any of its
Representatives), indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of
the Person or group of Persons making the inquiry, proposal or offer and the
material terms and conditions of any such inquiries, proposals or offers and
thereafter shall advise and confer with Parent and keep Parent reasonably
informed, on a prompt basis (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
after the occurrence of any changes, developments, discussions or
negotiations), regarding any material changes to the status and material
terms of any such inquiries, proposals or offers (including any material
amendments thereto or any material change to the scope or material terms or
conditions thereof including proposed agreements and material modifications
thereto).

(d) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, release
any Person from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant any
permission under, (i) any standstill provision or similar provision with
respect to Company Securities in any Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, or (ii) any confidentiality agreement to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; _provided, however_ , that
the Company Board shall be permitted to grant waivers of, and not enforce, any
standstill provision to the extent that (x) such provision would otherwise
prohibit the counterparty thereto from making a confidential Company
Acquisition Proposal directly to the Company Board in accordance with this
_Section 8.2_ and (y) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law. Except to the
extent otherwise permitted by the proviso in the foregoing sentence, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce the
confidentiality and standstill provisions of any such agreement.

 



81 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.4_, but in
all cases subject to _Section 8.2(b)_, as applicable, shall prohibit the
Company Board from taking and disclosing to their stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the 1934 Act or making a
statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the 1934 Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section
8.2(e)_ shall not permit the Company Board to effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent permitted by this _Section
8.2_. For the avoidance of doubt, any "stop, look and listen" communication or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
1934 Act shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

(f) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 8.2_ by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or its controlled Affiliates shall be deemed a breach of this
_Section 8.2_ by the Company, but only to the extent the Company did not
use reasonable best efforts to cause such Representative to comply with the
provisions of this Section 8.2.

Section 8.3  _Financing Cooperation_.

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and
consummate the Financing or any Substitute Financing as promptly as possible
following the date of this Agreement (and, in any event, no later than the
time at which the Acceptance Time is required to occur pursuant to _Section
2.4_), including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) (A) maintain in
effect the Debt Letters and comply with all of their respective obligations
thereunder, (B) negotiate, enter into and deliver definitive agreements with
respect to the Financing reflecting the terms and conditions contained in the
Debt Letters, so that such agreements are in effect no later than the time at
which the Acceptance Time is required to occur pursuant to _Section 2.4_ and
(C) enforce their rights under the Debt Letters and (ii) satisfy on a timely
basis all the conditions to the Financing and the definitive agreements
related thereto that are in Parents (or its Affiliates) control. In the
event that all conditions set forth in _Annex A_ have been satisfied or waived
in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ or, upon funding shall be satisfied or
waived, Parent and its Affiliates shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the Persons providing the Financing (the "Financing Parties") to fund
the Financing at the Acceptance Time with respect to shares accepted for
payment pursuant to the Offer and at the Effective Time with respect to shares
to be paid for pursuant to the Merger. Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of
the Financing and material developments with respect thereto and upon the
Companys written request, provide the Company promptly (and no later than two
(2) Business Days after such written request) with copies of any material
definitive agreements related to the Financing. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent shall, promptly (and in no event less than two (2) Business
Days) after obtaining knowledge thereof, give the Company written notice of
any (A) breach or default by Parent, its Affiliates, any Financing Party or
any other party to the Debt Letters or any definitive document related to the
Financing (or any event or circumstance, with or without notice, lapse of
time, or both, would give rise to any breach or default), (B) threatened in
writing or actual withdrawal, repudiation, expiration, intention not to fund
or termination of or relating to the Debt Letters or the Financing, (C)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt

82  related to the Financing or (D) if for any reason Parent in good faith no
longer believes it will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt
Financing. Parent may amend, modify, terminate, assign or agree to any waiver
under the Debt Letters without the prior written approval of the Company,
_provided_ , that Parent shall not, without Companys prior written consent,
permit any such amendment, modification, assignment, termination or waiver to
be made to, or consent to or agree to any waiver of, any provision of or
remedy under the Debt Letters which would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount), or (B) impose new or additional conditions to the
Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the
Financing, or (C) otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any provision of
the Debt Letters or the Financing in a manner that in the case of clause (C)
would reasonably be expected to (1) delay, prevent or make less likely the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the funding of the Financing
(or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) at the Effective Time,
(2) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the
Financing Parties or any other parties to the Debt Letters or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto or (3) adversely affect the ability of Parent
to timely consummate the acceptance of, and payment for, shares of Company
Stock by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 2.4_, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent may modify, supplement or amend the Debt Letters to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
that have not executed the Debt Letters as of the date of this Agreement. In
the event that new commitment letters and/or fee letters are entered into in
accordance with any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification
of the Debt Letters permitted pursuant to this  _Section 8.3_, such new
commitment letters and/or fee letters shall be deemed to be a part of the
"Financing" and deemed to be the "Debt Letters" for all purposes of this
Agreement. Parent shall promptly (and in any event no later than two (2)
Business Days) deliver to the Company true, correct and complete copies of any
termination, amendment, modification or replacement of the Debt Letters. If
funds in the amounts set forth in the Debt Letters, or any portion thereof,
become unavailable, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, as promptly
as practicable following the occurrence of such event to (x) notify the
Company in writing thereof, (y) use their respective reasonable best efforts
to obtain substitute financing (on terms and conditions that are not
materially less favorable to Parent, taken as a whole, than the terms and
conditions as set forth in the Debt Letters, taking into account any "market
flex" provisions thereof) sufficient to enable Parent to consummate the
acceptance of, and payment for, shares of Company Stock by Purchaser pursuant
to _Section 2.4_, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
in accordance with the terms hereof (the "Substitute Financing") and (z) use
their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain a new financing commitment
letter that provides for such Substitute Financing and, promptly after
execution thereof (and, in any event, no later than two (2) Business Days),
deliver to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the new commitment
letter and the related fee letters (in redacted form in a customary manner
removing the fee amounts, pricing caps, the rates and amounts included in the
"market flex" and certain other terms (none of which could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, termination
or aggregate principal amount of the Financing (other than in respect of
upfront fees))) and related definitive financing documents with respect to
such Substitute Financing. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such
Substitute Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the
"Financing" and any commitment letter for such Substitute Financing shall be
deemed the "Debt Letters" for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



83 (b) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due and
payable, all fees and other amounts that become due and payable under the
Debt Letters.

Substitute Financing or any other financing.

prior to the Closing Date and the delivery of customary authorization and
representation letters in connection therewith) customarily required in
connection with the marketing and syndication of the Financing (as set forth
in Section 4 of the Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this
Agreement);

(iii) using reasonable best efforts to furnish Parent, within a reasonable

Parent as provided in clause (f) below or give any indemnities prior to the
Closing, (B) it would require the Company to take any action that in the good
faith judgment of the Company unreasonably interferes with the ongoing
business or operations of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, (C) it would
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, execute, or
approve any agreement or other documentation prior to the Closing or agree to

Company for all of its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and

incurred by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
Representatives in connection with any cooperation contemplated by this

goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this  _Section 8.3_ shall require, and in no event

any conditions contained therein or otherwise, (ii) amend or waive any of the

as the requesting Party may reasonably request, including with respect to the
compliance program of the Party receiving the request; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Party receiving such request may restrict the foregoing access and
the disclosure of information to the extent that, in the good faith judgment
of such Party, (i) any Law applicable to such Party or its Subsidiaries
requires such Party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any
such properties or information, (ii) the information is subject to
confidentiality obligations to a Third Party, (iii) disclosure of any such
information or document could result in the loss of attorney-client privilege
( _provided_ , that such Party and/or its counsel shall use their reasonable
best efforts to enter into such joint defense agreements or other
arrangements, as appropriate, so as to allow for such disclosure in a manner
that does not result in the loss of attorney client privilege) or (iv) such
access would unreasonably disrupt the operations of such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to clauses (i)
through (iii) of this _Section 8.6(a)_ as it relates to access and
information provided to Parent and its Representatives, the Company shall use

employee benefit arrangements that have been or will be entered into after

policies of the NYSE to enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of
the Company Stock from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Company Stock

reasonably current basis with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall
give Parent the opportunity to participate, subject to a customary
joint defense agreement, in the defense or settlement of any Company
Transaction Litigation, and the Company shall not settle, agree to any
undertakings or approve or otherwise agree to any waiver that may be sought in
connection with such Company Transaction Litigation, without the prior
written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Without limiting in any way the Parties obligations under _Section

announced or publicly made known and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of

must be subsequently consummated), or any Company Acquisition Proposal shall
have been consummated (in each case, whether or not such

 



91  Company Acquisition Proposal is the same as the original Company Acquisition
Proposal made, communicated, publicly made known or publicly announced), then,

Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as applicable, fails
promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this  _Section 10.3_, and, in
order to obtain such payment, the other Party commences a suit that results in
a judgment against such Party for any amount due pursuant to this _Section
10.3_, then such Party shall pay the other Party its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount due pursuant to this _Section

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 11.1 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any schedule,
certificate, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement
shall survive the Effective Time. This _Section 11.1_ shall not limit
_Section 10.2_, _Section 10.3_ or any covenant or agreement of the Parties
which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

Section 11.2 _Amendment and Modification_. Subject to applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented in any and all respects by
written agreement of the Parties at any time prior to the Acceptance Time with
respect to any of the terms contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no amendments to or waivers of any DFS Provision shall be effective without
the written consent of the Financing Parties. A termination of this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section 10.1_ or an amendment or waiver of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 11.2_ or _Section 11.3_ shall, in order to be
effective, require, in the case of Parent, Purchaser and the Company, action
by their respective board of directors (or a committee thereof) or sole
member, as applicable.

Section 11.3 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
Parent or Purchaser on the one hand, or the Company on the other hand, may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
to this Agreement of the other Parties or (c) subject to the first proviso of
_Section 11.2_, waive compliance by the other Parties with any of the
agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Except as required by
applicable Law, no waiver of this Agreement shall require the approval of the
stockholders of either Parent or the Company. Any agreement on the part of a
Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party
to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise
by any Party of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or
further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that Parent shall act on behalf of Purchaser and
the Company may rely on any notice given by Parent on behalf of Purchaser with
respect to the matters set forth in this _Section 11.3_.

 

Section 11.4 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the

attorneys fees, incurred in connection with the filing by the Parties of the
premerger notification and report forms relating to the Offer and the Merger
under the HSR Act and the filing of any notice of other document under any
applicable foreign Competition Law, and (ii) filing fees and printing and
mailing costs for the Registration Statement.

Section 11.5 _Disclosure Letter References_. Each Disclosure Letter shall,
for all purposes in this Agreement, be arranged in numbered and lettered parts
and subparts corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and
subsections contained in this

  



93  Agreement. Each item disclosed in a Partys Disclosure Letter shall
constitute an exception to, or as applicable, disclosure for the purposes of,
the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) to which it
makes express reference and shall also be deemed to be disclosed or set forth
for the purposes of every other part in such Partys Disclosure Letter
relating to such Partys representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) set forth in this Agreement to the extent a cross-reference within
such Disclosure Letter is expressly made to such other part in such Disclosure
Letter, as well as to the extent that the relevance of such item as an
exception to, or as applicable, disclosure for purposes of, such other section
of this Agreement is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure.

being understood that each Party need not sign the same counterpart. This
Agreement shall become effective when each Party hereto shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by all of the other Parties. Signatures delivered
electronically or by facsimile shall be deemed to be original signatures.

 

Section 11.8 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Exhibits hereto and the documents and the instruments referred
to herein), the Confidentiality Agreement and any agreements entered into
contemporaneously herewith (a) constitute the entire agreement and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between
Parent and the Company and among the Parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof ( _provided_ , that (x) any provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement conflicting with this Agreement shall be superseded
by this Agreement and (y) all standstill or similar provisions set forth in
the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and no longer be in effect upon
execution and delivery hereof) and (b) are not intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities upon any Person other than the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except for the
rights of the holders of Company Stock to (i) following the Acceptance Time,
to receive the Offer Consideration in accordance with _Article II_ and (ii)
following the Effective Time, to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Article III_ ; _provided_ , that notwithstanding
the foregoing clause (b), following the Effective Time, the provisions of
_Section 7.4_ shall be enforceable by each Company Indemnified Party
hereunder and his or her heirs and his or her representatives;  _provided_ ,
_further_ that the Financing Parties and each of their respective Affiliates
and their respective current, former and future direct or indirect equity
holders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, assignees
or representatives (each, a "Financing Source Party," collectively, the
"Financing Source Parties") shall be express third party beneficiaries with
respect to _Section 11.2_, this _Section 11.8_, _Section 11.11_, _Section
11.12(c)_, _Section 11.13_ and _Section 11.14_ (collectively, the "DFS
Provisions").

 



95 Section 11.9 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the economic and legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby, taken as a whole, are not affected in
a manner materially adverse to any Party hereto. Upon such a determination,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

__Section 11.10  _Assignment_ __. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
Parties in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment
without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , that Parent may
designate, prior to the Effective Time, by written notice to the Company,
another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent with respect to
which the representations and warranties of such Subsidiary as Purchaser must
be true and correct in all respects hereunder to be a party to the Offer and
the Merger in lieu of Purchaser, in which event all references herein to
Purchaser shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary (except with
respect to representations and warranties made herein with respect to
Purchaser as of the date of this Agreement) and all representations and
warranties made herein with respect to Purchaser as of the date of this
Agreement shall also be made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the
date of such designation; _provided_ , that such assignment shall not relieve
Parent of its obligations hereunder or otherwise enlarge, alter or change any
obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or such other
Subsidiary; _and provided further_ , that such assignment does not adversely
affect the Offer or the Merger or the timing thereof in any way. This
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. __

 

Section 11.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to
the principles of conflicts of law thereof or of any other jurisdiction,
except that, notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise set forth in
the Debt Letters as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, all matters
relating to the interpretation, construction, validity and enforcement
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise) against any of
the Financing Source Parties in any way relating to the Debt Letters or the
performance thereof or the Financing, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the domestic Law of the State of New York
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction that would cause
the application of Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

Section 11.12  _Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction_.

(a) The rights and remedies of the Parties shall be cumulative (and
not alternative). The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and
that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that, subject to the limitations in _Section 10.3(d)_, and in the next
sentence of

 



96  this _Section 11.12(a)_, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including
the obligations to consummate the Offer and the Merger, in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction over such matter is vested in the federal courts, any federal
court located in the State of Delaware without proof of actual damages or
otherwise (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

(b) In addition, each of the Parties (i) consents to submit itself, and
hereby submits itself, to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of
Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any
state court of the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, in
the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave
from any such court, and agrees not to plead or claim any objection to the
laying of venue in any such court or that any judicial proceeding in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (iii) agrees that it will
not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of
Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any
state court of the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, and
(iv) consents to service of process being made through the notice
procedures set forth in _Section 11.6_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party
agrees (on behalf of itself and its controlled Affiliates) that it will not
bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Source Parties in
any way relating to this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of the
Debt Letters or the performance thereof or the Financing, in any forum other
than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if
under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts,
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in the
County of New York (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom). 

Section 11.13 _No Recourse; Waiver of Claims_. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries, stockholders,
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and Representatives hereby waives
any rights or claims against any Financing Source Party in connection with
this Agreement, the Debt Letters or the Financing, whether at law or equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise, and each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, stockholders, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and
Representatives agrees not to commence a Proceeding against any Financing
Source Party in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereunder (including any Proceeding relating to the Financing or
the Debt Letters). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing
waiver, it is agreed that no Financing Source Party shall have any liability
for any claims, losses, settlements, liabilities, damages, costs, expenses,
fines or penalties to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, stockholders,
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and Representatives in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder. Nothing in
this _Section 11.13_ shall

 



97  in any way (a) expand the circumstances in which Parent may be liable under
this Agreement or as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including as a result of the Financing) or (b) limit or qualify the
obligations and liabilities of the parties to the Debt Letters to each other
thereunder or in connection therewith.

 

Section 11.14 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING AGAINST THE FINANCING SOURCE PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED
TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, THE DEBT LETTERS, THE FINANCING OR
THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES WITH RESPECT THERETO).

discretion, in each case, subject to _Section 2.1(b)_ of the Agreement and
the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure by Parent or
Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
