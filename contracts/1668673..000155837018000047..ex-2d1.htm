 \t\t\tSection 2.4. Deliveries at the Closing. At the Closing, (i) the

 \t\t\t(a) Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the

statement setting forth the Company's good faith estimates of the Closing Net
Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Net Working Capital"), together with
reasonably detailed supporting documentation for such estimates, (ii) the

Expenses Statement. If the Buyer disputes any amounts relating to the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, Estimated Closing Indebtedness and
Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses set forth in such statements referred to
in (i), (ii) and (iii) above, the Buyer and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute prior to
the Closing, and the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, Estimated Closing
Indebtedness and Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses, as applicable, as
determined by the Company (if applicable, modified by agreement of the Buyer
and the Seller prior to the Closing) shall be used for purposes of determining
the payment to be made by the Buyer at Closing pursuant to Section 2.2(a)
(provided, however, that if the Buyer and the Company are unable to resolve
any such dispute prior to the Closing, the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital, Estimated Closing Indebtedness and Estimated Seller Transaction
Expenses, as applicable, as determined by the Company and set forth in the
statement delivered pursuant to this Section 2.5(a) shall be used for purposes
of determining the payment to be made by the Buyer at Closing pursuant to
Section 2.2(a), absent manifest error). For illustrative purposes only,
Schedule 2.5(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth the calculation of the
Closing Net Working Capital assuming that the Closing had been consummated on

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall deliver to the Seller a statement setting forth the Buyer's good faith
determinations of the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness
and the Closing Seller Transaction Expenses, together with reasonably detailed
supporting documentation for such determinations (the "Closing Statement");
provided, that for purposes of determining the accounts receivable of the
Company to be included in the Closing Net Working Capital to be determined
pursuant to this Section 2.5 (including the Closing Net Working Capital
included on the Closing Statement), only such accounts receivable that (i)
have been collected as of the date of the Closing Statement or (ii) are less
than ninety (90) days aged will be included in the Closing Net Working
Capital. \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The Seller may, by notice given to the Buyer within thirty
(30) days after delivery of the Closing Statement, dispute the Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Seller Transaction Expenses
set forth on the Closing Statement (the "Closing Statement Dispute Notice").
Such Closing Statement Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the
Seller's objections to the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness
and Closing Seller Transaction Expenses set forth on the Closing Statement,
and the Seller's reasons therefor and the Seller shall be deemed to have
agreed with all other items contained in the Closing Statement. If the Seller
does not deliver such a Closing Statement Dispute Notice to the Buyer within
thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing Statement, the Closing
Statement, and the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and
Closing Seller Transaction Expenses as set forth therein, shall be final and
binding on the Buyer and the Seller. If the Seller delivers such a Closing
Statement Dispute Notice, from the date of delivery of such Closing Statement
Dispute Notice until the 30th day after the date of delivery of such Closing
Statement Dispute Notice, the Buyer and the Seller shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to attempt in good faith to resolve the
dispute identified in the Closing Statement Dispute Notice. From the date of
delivery of such Closing Statement Dispute Notice until the 30th day after the
date of delivery of the Closing Statement Dispute Notice, the Buyer and
Buyer's Accountants shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with the Seller and the Company Accountants and provide
reasonable access to work papers of Buyer's Accountants to the extent
reasonably necessary for purposes of preparing the Closing Statement and
resolving any disputes relating to the Closing Statement and the Closing
Statement Dispute Notice. The Buyer shall provide to the Seller and its
representatives, including the Company Accountants, access at all reasonable
times to the Buyer and their books and records at the Seller's sole cost and
expense and to the extent reasonably necessary for the purposes of preparing
the Closing Statement Dispute Notice.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) If the Seller has timely delivered a Closing Statement
Dispute Notice pursuant to Section 2.5(c), and the Buyer and the Seller do not
reach written agreement as to the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness and Closing Seller Transaction Expenses, as applicable, prior to
the 30th day after the date of delivery of the Closing Statement Dispute
Notice, then either the Seller or the Buyer may by notice to the other (the
"Resolution Notice") submit to Grant Thornton (the "Unaffiliated Firm") for
determination, in accordance with this Section 2.5, the amount of the Closing
Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Seller Transaction
Expenses, as applicable. The following shall apply with respect to the use of
the Unaffiliated Firm: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t (i) Within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the
Resolution Notice, the Buyer and the Seller shall each propose an amount of
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Seller
Transaction Expenses, as applicable, to the Unaffiliated Firm, together with
the reasons therefor, in writing. The Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness and Closing Seller Transaction Expenses proposed by the Buyer
shall not differ from the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness
and Closing Seller Transaction Expenses, respectively, set forth on the
Closing Statement other than for those changes agreed to in writing by the
Seller, and the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing
Seller Transaction Expenses set forth on the Closing Statement proposed by the
Seller shall not differ from the Seller's proposed amounts of Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Seller  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t19  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tTransaction Expenses, respectively, set forth in the Closing Statement
Dispute Notice, other than for those changes agreed to in writing by the
Buyer. Each of the Buyer and the Seller shall furnish to the Unaffiliated
Firm such workpapers and other documents and information under its control or
available to it and its Affiliates as the Unaffiliated Firm may request for
the purposes of determining the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness and Closing Seller Transaction Expenses, as applicable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) The amount determined by the Unaffiliated Firm (acting as
an expert and not as an arbitrator) shall not be higher than the higher of the
proposed amounts of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and
Closing Seller Transaction Expenses or lower than the lower of the proposed
amounts of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing
Seller Transaction Expenses, as applicable, and shall thereupon be the Closing
Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Seller Transaction
Expenses. The Parties will instruct the Unaffiliated Firm to render its
decision no later than thirty (30) days after the submission to the
Unaffiliated Firm under Section 2.5(d)(i). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tAny determination of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness and Closing Seller Transaction Expenses, as applicable, in
accordance with Section 2.5, whether by agreement between the Buyer and the
Seller, by operation of the second sentence of Section 2.5(d), or by the
Unaffiliated Firm, shall be conclusive and binding on all Parties. The
Closing Net Working Capital determined as set forth in the preceding sentence
is hereinafter referred to as the "Final Closing Net Working Capital." The
Closing Indebtedness determined as set forth in the first sentence of this
paragraph is hereinafter referred to as the "Final Closing Indebtedness." The
Closing Seller Transaction Expenses determined as set forth in the first
sentence of this paragraph is hereinafter referred to as the "Final Closing
Seller Transaction Expenses." \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) The fees and expenses of the Unaffiliated Firm for its
services and expenses under this Section 2.5 shall be borne by the party
(either Buyer on the one hand or the Seller on the other hand) whose proposal
of the Net Adjustment Amount is furthest away from the Unaffiliated Firm's
final determination of the Net Adjustment Amount. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Nothing herein shall be construed to authorize or permit
the Unaffiliated Firm to arbitrate or determine any question or matter
whatever under or in connection with this Agreement except the specific items
in dispute between the Parties with respect to the amount of the Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Seller Transaction Expenses
to be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or
require the Unaffiliated Firm to follow the rules of the American Arbitration
Association or any other body in making such determination. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Promptly, but in any event not more than five (5) Business
Days, after the determination of the Final Closing Net Working Capital, Final
Closing Indebtedness and Final Closing Seller Transaction Expenses in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.5: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative, the Seller and
the Company shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to
pay to the Company the absolute value of such Negative Adjustment Amount (the
"Final Shortfall")  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t20  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tby wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more
accounts designated by the Company. The instructions to the Escrow Agent
shall provide that the amount of the Final Shortfall shall be paid from the
Adjustment Escrow Fund. In the event that the amount of the Adjustment Escrow
Fund exceeds the amount of the Final Shortfall (such excess, the "Escrow
Excess Amount"), the Seller and the Company shall simultaneously with the
delivery of the instructions described in this Section 2.5(g)(i) deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to pay to the Seller the Escrow
Excess Amount for the benefit of the Stockholders. In the event that the
Final Shortfall exceeds the amount of the Adjustment Escrow Fund (such excess,
the "Shortfall Excess Amount"), the Seller and the Stockholders shall be
jointly and severally liable to pay to the Buyer the amount of such Shortfall
Excess Amount.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, the Buyer or the
Company shall pay to the Seller the amount of such Net Adjustment Amount (the
"Final Surplus") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated by the Seller. In addition, the Seller and the Company
shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the
Escrow Agent to pay to the Seller the Adjustment Escrow Fund.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is equal to zero, the Buyer
and the Seller shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to the Seller all then-remaining
amounts in the Adjustment Escrow Account. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.6. Withholding. The Buyer and the Company will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document (including payments of the Purchase Price
and releases of the Adjustment Escrow Fund) such amounts as the Buyer or the
Company (or any Affiliate thereof) shall determine in good faith they are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other provision of applicable Laws. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Buyer or the Company, such withheld amounts
will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made. \t\t

Section 1.1 of NI 45-106. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Seller is acquiring the PetIQ Stock Consideration and
the Holdings LLC Consideration for investment for the Seller's own account and
not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the distribution or
other disposition thereof except as permitted by Law, including Securities

 \t\t\t(c) The Seller has not been provided with an offering
memorandum or prospectus (each as defined under applicable Securities Laws) or
any similar document in connection with the issue of the PetIQ Stock

Consideration and the Holdings LLC Consideration has not been registered under
the Securities Act, that the PetIQ Stock Consideration and the Holdings LLC
Consideration may not be sold or otherwise disposed of unless they are
registered thereunder or an exemption from registration is available and that
accordingly the Seller may be required to bear the economic risk of the
investment in the PetIQ Stock Consideration and the Holdings LLC Consideration
for an indefinite period of time. The Seller also understands that the Buyer
does not have any intention of registering the Holdings LLC Consideration
under the Securities Act or of supplying the information which may be
necessary to enable the Seller to sell the Holdings LLC Consideration pursuant
to Rule 144 under the Securities Act; provided, however, that upon the
conversion of the PetIQ Stock Consideration and the Holdings LLC
Consideration, jointly, into PetIQ Class A Shares, Buyer and PetIQ shall

documents, the Buyer, Holdings and PetIQ and their Affiliates and the business
and prospects of the Buyer, Holdings and PetIQ and their Affiliates (including
the transactions to be consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement),
as the Seller deems necessary to evaluate the merits and risks related to its
investment in the PetIQ Stock Consideration and the Holdings LLC Consideration
and no representations concerning such matters or any other matters related to
such investment have been made to the Seller except as set forth in this
Agreement. The Seller has consulted its own attorney, accountant or
investment advisor with respect to the investment contemplated hereby and its
suitability for the Seller, including the tax and other economic
considerations related to the investment. \t\t

to suffer a complete loss of the investment in the PetIQ Stock Consideration

 \t\t\t(g) The Seller has been informed that the offer of the PetIQ
Stock Consideration and the Holdings LLC Consideration is being made pursuant
to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act
relating to transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering, and

both, would constitute a default or violation, in any material respect of any
term, condition or provision of any License to which such Target Company is a

such as leases, licenses, or credit agreements ("Ordinary Course Tax

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(l) Each of the Company\'s "nonqualified deferred compensation
plans" within the meaning of Code Section 409A has been operated in compliance
with Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and
no such "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" has or will result in any
participant incurring income acceleration or Taxes under Code Section 409A.
The Company has not agreed to pay, gross up, or otherwise indemnify any
employee or contractor for any Taxes, including potential Taxes imposed under
Code Section 409A.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(m) The Company was at all times on or prior to the
Reorganization Transactions treated as a partnership for income Tax purposes.

jurisdiction in which Hapypet Corporation conducted business or could
otherwise be subject to income Taxes. Each of these elections was initially
effective as of Hapypet Corporation's date of incorporation and was effective
through August 4, 2014. No event has occurred (or fact has existed) that
would have precluded Hapypet Corporation from initially qualifying as an S
corporation under Code Section 1361(a). No Governmental Entity has challenged
the effectiveness of any of these elections.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(o) VIP Petcare, LLC has not incurred (and has no potential

and current products and services of the Target Company and the Managed
Practices, have not infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated, and do
not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate, any Intellectual Property
rights, rights of publicity or privacy rights of any Person. Except as set

the distribution or other disposition \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tthereof except as permitted by Law, including Securities Laws. The
Buyer does not have any present intent to resell or distribute all or any part
of the Units. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The Buyer has been advised that the Units have not been
registered under the Securities Act, that the Units may not be sold or
otherwise disposed of unless they are registered thereunder or an exemption
from registration is available and that accordingly the Buyer may be required
to bear the economic risk of the investment in the Units for an indefinite
period of time. The Buyer also understands that the Seller does not have any
intention of registering the Units under the Securities Act or of supplying
the information which may be necessary to enable the Buyer to sell the Units
pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) The Buyer has been given the opportunity to obtain any
information or documents, and to ask questions and receive answers about such
documents, the Target Companies and their Affiliates and the business and
prospects of the Target Companies and their Affiliates (including the
transactions to be consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement), as
the Buyer deems necessary to evaluate the merits and risks related to its
investment in the Units and no representations concerning such matters or any
other matters related to such investment have been made to the Buyer except as
set forth in this Agreement. The Buyer has consulted its own attorney,
accountant or investment advisor with respect to the investment contemplated
hereby and its suitability for the Buyer, including the tax and other economic
considerations related to the investment. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) The Buyer's knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters are such that the Buyer is capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of the investment in the Company. The Buyer's financial situation
is such that the Buyer can afford to bear the economic risk of the Buyer's
investment in the Company for an indefinite period of time, and the Buyer can
afford to suffer the complete loss of the Buyer's entire investment in the
Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) The Buyer understands that the purchase of the Units
pursuant to this Agreement is a speculative investment which involves a high
degree of risk of loss of the entire investment therein, that there will be
substantial restrictions on the transferability of the Units and that for an
indefinite period following the Closing Date there will be no public market
for such Units and that a public market may never exist therefor, and that,
accordingly, it may not be possible for the Buyer to sell the Units in case of
emergency or otherwise. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) The Buyer understands that no federal, provincial or state
agency has made any finding or determination regarding the fairness of the
offering of Units for investment, or any recommendation or endorsement
thereof. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) The Buyer is not subscribing for the Units as a result of,
or subsequent to, any advertisement, article, notice or other communication
published in any newspapers, magazine or similar media or broadcast over
television or radio, or presented at any seminar or meeting, or any
solicitation of a subscription by a Person not previously known to the Buyer
in connection with investments in securities generally. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give
Buyer, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's
operations at any time before the Closing. The Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its own operations. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.4. Full Access. The Company and the Seller will permit
the Buyer and its representatives to have full access, at all reasonable times
and upon reasonable notice, and in a manner so as not to interfere with the
normal business operations of the Target Companies, to all premises,
properties, personnel, books, records (including Tax records), Contracts, and
documents of, or pertaining to, the Target Companies. The Buyer will treat
and hold as such any Confidential Information (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) it receives from the Seller or the Target Companies
in the course of the reviews contemplated by this Section 5.4 or otherwise.
No investigation by the Buyer prior to or after the date of this Agreement
shall diminish or obviate any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Seller and/or the Company contained in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Documents to which the Seller and/or the Company is a party.

written advice of the Company's counsel, restrict the foregoing access to the
extent such Party reasonably believes any applicable Laws require that Party
to restrict or prohibit access to any of the Company and/or the Seller's
properties or information and (ii) neither the Company nor the Seller shall be
required to provide access to or disclose information where such Party
reasonably believes, upon the written advice of the Company's counsel, access
or disclosure would jeopardize the protection of attorney-client
privilege. \t\t

 \t\t

threatened occurrence of which any such Party  \t\t

Agreement would have been required to be set forth or disclosed in or pursuant
to this Agreement, which (if existing and known at any time prior to or at the
Closing) would make the performance by any Party of a covenant contained in
this Agreement impossible, or which (if existing and known at the time of the
Closing) would cause a condition to any Party's obligations under this
Agreement not to be fully satisfied; provided, however, that any notice
provided pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall in no way effect the rights of the
Parties to indemnification as set forth in Article 8 hereto.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.6. Exclusivity. The Company, the Seller and the
Stockholders shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than the Buyer and its
Affiliates and their respective agents and representatives) conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Transaction. The Company, the
Seller, the Stockholders or any of its directors, officers, employees,
representatives or agents will not, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate,
facilitate, or encourage (including by way of furnishing or disclosing non-
public information) any inquiries or the making of any proposal with respect
to any Acquisition Transaction or negotiate or otherwise facilitate,
encourage, solicit, initiate or engage in discussions, negotiations or
submissions of proposals or offers with any Person with respect to any
Acquisition Transaction, enter into any written agreement, arrangement, or
understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate, or fail to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise cooperate in any way
with or assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or
attempt by any other Person to do or seek any of the foregoing. The Company,
the Seller and the Stockholders shall immediately advise the Buyer in writing
of the receipt of any written inquiries or proposals or requests for
information related to an Acquisition Transaction and shall disclose to the
Buyer the terms of any such proposal or offer. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.7. Liens; Intercompany Debt. The Company, the Seller
and the Stockholders shall take all necessary actions to cause the termination
and release on or prior to the Closing Date of the Liens referred to in
Section 3.9(d) of the Disclosure Schedule as to be so released. At or prior
to Closing, the Company shall take all such actions reasonably necessary such
that the Company shall have no obligation with respect to any accounts payable
of the Target Companies and the Managed Practices to the Seller, the
Stockholders or any of their Affiliates or guarantees or sureties made by the
Target Companies or the Managed Practices, as applicable, in favor of the
Seller, the Stockholders or any of their Affiliates, nor any rights with
respect to any accounts receivable of the Company from the Seller, the
Stockholders or any of their Affiliates. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.7
of the Disclosure Schedule, all agreements and arrangements between a Target
Company or a Managed Practice, on the one hand, and the Seller, the
Stockholders or any of their Affiliates (other than the Target Companies or
the Managed Practices), on the other hand, shall be terminated in their
entirety effective as of the Closing by the Parties and shall be deemed
voided, cancelled and discharged in their entirety and the Seller and the
Stockholders shall provide copies of an agreement pursuant to which such
agreements and arrangements shall have been terminated effective as of or
prior to the Closing and evidence of such terminations to the Buyer at
Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.8. Financial Information. Subject to the provisions of
Section 5.10(a), within fifteen (15) days following the end of each calendar
month following the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Seller shall

normal year-end adjustments). Prior to the Closing, the Company, the
Stockholders, and the Seller shall provide to the Buyer, and shall cause the
officers, employees and representatives of the Company to provide to the
Buyer, all cooperation reasonably requested by the Buyer that is necessary or
reasonably required in connection with the Financing by the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.9. Financing. The Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
obtain the debt financing described in the commitment letter from Ares Capital
Management LLC, dated January 5, 2018 (the "Commitments"), in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Financing"),
including using commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy on a timely basis
all conditions applicable to the Buyer obtaining the Financing that are within
its control, negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto and
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing. The Buyer represents and
warrants as of the date hereof that it has no reason to believe (assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article 7 in accordance with their
terms) that the Financing will not be consummated on the terms set forth in
the Commitments. Seller shall cause the Target Companies to use their
reasonable best efforts to furnish Buyer and its lenders and other financial
institutions that may provide the financing (together with such lenders' and
other financial institutions' respective Affiliates and their and their
respective Affiliates' officers, directors, employees, controlling persons,
agents and representatives and their respective successors and assigns, the
"Debt Financing Sources") with such financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Target Companies as may be reasonably requested by Buyer to
obtain the Financing.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) any breach of a representation or warranty made by the

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) any breach by the Company, the Seller or the Stockholders

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tAny breach of or inaccuracy in a Tax Representation shall be governed
by Section 8.1(c) rather than Section 8.1(a) and any breach of a covenant of
the Company, the Seller or the Stockholders with respect to Taxes shall be

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.2. The Buyer's Indemnification Obligations. Subject to
the provisions of this Article 8, after the Closing, PetIQ, Holdings and the

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.3. Indemnification Procedure. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) If, subsequent to the Closing, any Person entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement (an "Indemnified Party") asserts a claim
for indemnification for, or receives notice of the assertion or commencement
of, any Third Party Claim as to which such Indemnified Party intends to seek
indemnification under this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall give
reasonably prompt written notice of such claim to the Party from whom
indemnification is to be sought (an "Indemnifying Party"), together with a
statement of any available information regarding such claim. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party (the
"Defense Notice") within fifteen (15) days after receipt from the Indemnified
Party of notice of such claim, by which notice the Indemnifying Party shall
specify the counsel it will appoint to defend such claim ("Defense Counsel")
or, if applicable, to conduct at its expense the defense against any such
Third Party Claim in its own name, or if necessary in the name of the
Indemnified Party; provided, however, that, in the case of such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to approve the Defense
Counsel, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The
Parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the
defense, negotiation or settlement of any Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party delivers a Defense Notice to the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party will cooperate with and make available to the Indemnifying
Party such assistance and materials as may be reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party, all at the expense of the Indemnifying Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ its own counsel and participate in the defense of such, but the fees
and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party.
As a condition precedent to the Indemnifying Party's right to assume control
over the defense of a Third Party Claim, (i) it must furnish the Indemnified
Party with reasonable evidence that the Indemnifying Party is and will be able
to satisfy any such liability and (ii) acknowledge its obligation to indemnify
the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume control of the defense
of any Third Party Claim and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel retained by the Indemnified Party, if the Third Party Claim which the
Indemnifying Party seeks to assume control (i) seeks non-monetary relief, (ii)
involves criminal or quasi-criminal allegations, (iii) is a claim in which the
Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that there are one or more legal
or equitable defenses available to them which are different from or in
addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party, and, in the reasonable
opinion of the Indemnified Party, counsel for the Indemnifying Party could not
adequately represent the interests of the Indemnified Party because such
interests could be in conflict with those of the Indemnifying Party, (iv)
involves a claim which, upon petition by the Indemnified Party, the
appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to
vigorously prosecute or defend, (v) has potential Adverse Consequences in
excess of the Buyer Indemnity Cap Amount or the principal amount of the Seller
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t65  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNotes, as applicable, (vi) involves, or could have a material effect
on, any material matter involving, directly or indirectly, the Indemnified
Party beyond the scope of the indemnification obligation of the Indemnifying
Party, or (vii) is a claim for which, in the reasonable opinion of the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party does not have the financial
wherewithal to pay for such defense. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) If the Indemnifying Party shall fail to give a Defense
Notice with respect to a Third Party Claim of which notice is given in
accordance with Section 8.3(a) above, it shall be deemed to have elected not
to conduct the defense of the subject Third Party Claim, and in such event the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct such defense in good faith.
If the Indemnified Party defends any Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying
Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for the reasonable costs and
expenses of defending such Third Party Claim upon submission of periodic
bills. If the Indemnifying Party elects to conduct the defense of the subject
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate, at its own expense,
in the defense of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that such
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with
separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if so requested by
the Indemnifying Party to participate, or, in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict or potential conflict exists
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such
separate representation advisable; and provided, further, that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more than one counsel for
all Indemnified Parties in connection with any Third Party Claim. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Regardless of which Party defends a Third Party Claim, the
other Party shall have the right at its expense to participate in the defense
of such Third Party Claim, assisted by counsel of its own choosing. The
Indemnified Party shall not compromise, settle, default on, or admit liability
with respect to a Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, and, if the Indemnified Party settles, compromises, defaults on, or
admits liability with respect to a Third Party Claim except in compliance with
the foregoing, the Indemnified Party will be liable for all costs, expenses,
settlement amounts, or other Adverse Consequences paid or incurred in
connection therewith and the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect thereto. The Indemnifying Party
shall not compromise or settle a Third Party Claim without the consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; provided, the Indemnified Party shall not be required to consent to a
compromise or settlement if such compromise or settlement (i) does not include
as a term thereof an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party, (ii)
imposes any non-monetary obligations on the Indemnified Party or monetary
obligations that are not subject to the indemnification provisions of this
Agreement, (iii) contains any admission or statement suggesting any wrongdoing
or liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been
rendered by a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction and the expiration
of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been
consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have
arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to a Third Party Claim
hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party
notice of any sums due and owing by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such matter and the Indemnifying Party shall be
required to pay all of the sums so due and owing to the  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIndemnified Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds
within ten (10) Business Days after the date of such notice. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) To the extent that there is an inconsistently between this
Section 8.3 and Section 9.5 as it relates to a Tax Contest, the provisions of
Section 9.5 shall govern. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.4. Direct Claims. It is the intent of the Parties that
all direct claims by an Indemnified Party against a Party not arising out of
Third Party Claims shall be subject to and benefit from the terms of this
Article 8. Any claim under this Article 8 by an Indemnified Party for
indemnification other than indemnification against a Third Party Claim (a
"Direct Claim") will be asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, and the Indemnifying Party will have a period
of fifteen (15) days within which to satisfy such Direct Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such fifteen (15) day period,
the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which
event the Indemnified Party will be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party under this Article 8. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.5. Failure to Give Timely Notice. A failure by an
Indemnified Party to give timely, complete, or accurate notice as provided in
Section 8.3 or 8.4 shall not affect the rights or obligations of either Party
hereunder except to the extent that, as a result of such failure, any Party
entitled to receive such notice was deprived of its right to recover any
payment under its applicable insurance coverage or was otherwise materially
adversely affected or damaged as a result of such failure to give timely,
complete, and accurate notice. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.6. Reduction of Adverse Consequences. The Parties shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to collect the proceeds of any
insurance that would have the effect of reducing any Adverse Consequences (in
which case such proceeds shall reduce such Adverse Consequences); provided,
that, nothing contained herein shall require the Buyer to seek coverage under
the representation and warranty insurance policy obtained by the Buyer. To the
extent any Adverse Consequences of an Indemnified Party are reduced by receipt
of payment actually received under insurance policies, such payments (net of
the expenses of the recovery thereof) shall be credited against such Adverse
Consequences and, if indemnification payments shall have been received prior
to the collection of such proceeds, the Indemnified Party shall remit to the
Indemnifying Party the amount of such (net of the expenses of the recovery
thereof) to the extent of indemnification payments received in respect of such
Adverse Consequences. Each Party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate
any of its losses upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be
expected to, or does, give rise thereto.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.7. Limitations on Indemnities. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The Seller and the Stockholders shall not have any liability
pursuant to Section 8.1(a) unless and until the aggregate amount of all
Adverse Consequences subject to this Section 8.7(a) exceeds the Seller
Threshold Amount, and then the Seller and the Stockholders shall have
liability for the full amount of such Adverse Consequences (including the

amount not to exceed the Base Cash Purchase Price, (B) by set-off against the
principal amount of any of the Seller Notes or (C) by forfeiture of Holdings

be the volume weighted average price of one (1) share of PetIQ Class A Stock
on the NASDAQ Global Market for the five (5) trading days ending on the day
prior to such forfeiture. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Each Party hereto expressly disclaims reliance upon any
express or implied representations or warranties of any nature, whether in
writing, orally or otherwise, made by or on behalf of or imputed to any other
Party hereto or any of its or their representatives, except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement. Each Party hereto understands and acknowledges that,
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no other Party nor or any of
its or their representatives is making any representation or warranty as to
the accuracy or completeness of any evaluation materials or any other
information concerning the business of the such Party provided to or prepared
for any Party or its representatives in anticipation of or in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, it being understood that the
rights of the Parties under this Article 8 shall not be affected
notwithstanding (i) the making of this Agreement (ii) any investigation or
examination conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired) about the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation made
by or on behalf of the Parties hereto, (iii) the waiver of any condition based
on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation, or (iv)
the Closing hereunder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no claim for indemnification hereunder shall be made with respect
to any Closing Indebtedness, Seller Transaction Expenses or any other asset or
liability to the extent included in the calculation of Closing Net Working
Capital. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) No claim shall be brought or maintained by an Indemnified
Party or their respective successors or permitted assigns against any officer,
director, employee (present or former), agent, lender or Affiliate of any
Party hereto which is not otherwise expressly identified as a Party hereto or
is a successor or assign of any Party hereto, and no recourse shall be brought
or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants of any Party hereto set forth or contained in this
Agreement. No Indemnified Party may avoid the limitations on liability set
forth in this Article 8 by seeking damages for breach of contract, tort or
pursuant to any other theory of liability and each Party hereby waives any
rights with respect to such claims from and after the Closing, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.11. Adjustment to Purchase Price. Any amounts which are
paid or otherwise accrue to the Buyer pursuant to this Article 8 will be

otherwise required by applicable law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.12. Scope of Disclosures. Disclosure of information
included in any Section of the Disclosure Schedule (or portion of any such
Section) shall be considered disclosures for all other Sections (or other
portions of other Sections) of the Disclosure Schedule to the extent that it
is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure
is applicable to such other Sections (or other portions of Sections). The
fact that any disclosure on any Section of the  \t\t

 \t\t\tDisclosure Schedule is not required to be disclosed in order to render
the applicable representation or warranty to which it relates true, or that
the absence of such disclosure on any Section would not constitute a breach of
such representation or warranty, shall not be deemed or construed to expand
the scope of any representation or warranty hereunder or to establish a
standard of disclosure in respect of any representation or warranty. Neither
the specification of any dollar amount in any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any of
the Sections of the Disclosure Schedule is intended to vary the definition of
Material Adverse Effect or to imply that such amount, or higher or lower
amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not material, and
no Party shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the
inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between the Parties
as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included
in any Section of the Disclosure Schedules is or is not material for purposes
of this Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically provides otherwise,
neither the specification of any item or matter in any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
any Section of the Disclosure Schedules hereto is intended to imply that such
item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the Ordinary
Course of Business, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting forth or
the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between
the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in any Section of the Disclosure Schedules is or is not in the
Ordinary Course of Business for purposes of this Agreement unless it is so
specified. \t\t

 \t\t\tARTICLE 9 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tTAX MATTERS \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.1. Apportionment of Taxes. For purposes of determining
the amount of Taxes that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion of any
Straddle Period ending on or prior to the Closing Date) the Parties agree as
follows: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) In the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis for a Straddle Period, the amounts that are
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall be determined by multiplying the amount of such Tax for the entire
Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) In the case of all Taxes in the form of interest or
penalties that relate to Taxes attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or
portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date), all such Taxes
shall be treated as occurring in a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date) whether such items are
incurred, accrued, assessed or similarly charged on, before or after the
Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) In the case of all other Taxes (including income Taxes,
employment Taxes, and sales and use Taxes) for a Straddle Period, the amount
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall be determined as if the applicable Target Company filed a separate Tax
Return with respect to such Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period
ending as of the end of the day on the Closing Date using a "closing of the
books methodology." For  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t70  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tpurposes of clause (c), any item determined on an annual or periodic
basis (including amortization and depreciation deductions and the effects of
graduated rates) shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date based on the mechanics set forth in clause (a) for
periodic Taxes. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.2. Cooperation. With respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (or portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date), the
Buyer, the Seller and the Stockholders shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to) (a) assist in the preparation and timely filing of any Tax
Return of the Target Companies; (b) assist in any audit or other Proceeding
with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Target Companies (whether or not a
Tax Contest); (c) make available any information, records, or other documents
relating to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Target Companies; (d) provide any
information necessary or reasonably requested to allow the Buyer or the Target
Companies to comply with any information reporting or withholding requirements
contained in applicable Laws; and (e) provide certificates or forms, and
timely execute any Tax Return, that are necessary or appropriate to establish
an exemption for (or reduction in) any Transfer Tax. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.3. Transfer Taxes. All federal, state, local, non-U.S.
transfer, excise, sales, use, ad valorem value added, registration, stamp,
recording, property and similar Taxes or fees applicable to, imposed upon, or
arising out of the transfer of the shares in the Company or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement and all related interest and
penalties (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") shall be paid by the Seller.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.4. Tax Returns.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The Seller, at the Seller's sole cost and expense, shall
prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, and timely
pay all Taxes that are payable with respect to all (i) Tax Returns for the
Target Companies due on or prior to the Closing Date and (ii) the IRS Form
1065 (and any comparable state and local Tax Returns) of the Target Companies
for any taxable periods ending, or deemed to end, on or prior to the Closing
Date (the "Flow-Through Returns" and, collectively with the returns in (i),
the "Seller Prepared Returns"). All Seller Prepared Returns shall be prepared
in accordance with existing procedures and practices of the Company with
respect to the treatment of specific items on the returns, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law; provided that any transactions as to which CCI is
a party shall be reported consistent with the CCI 2017 Returns (as prepared in
accordance with Section 9.4(b)). Each Flow-Through Return due after the
Closing Date shall be submitted to the Buyer, for the Buyer's review and
comment at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of such Flow-Through
Return and the Seller shall incorporate any reasonable comments made to such
Flow-Through Return by the Buyer. To the extent required by Law, the Buyer
shall cause the Company to file, in the form approved by the Buyer, all Flow-
Through Returns due after the Closing Date prepared by the Seller and timely
delivered to the Buyer in accordance with this Section 9.4(a). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Buyer shall cause the Company to prepare and timely file
all Tax Returns of the Company due after the Closing Date other than Flow-
Through Returns (the "Buyer Prepared Returns"). To the extent that a Buyer
Prepared Return relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, such Tax Return shall be
prepared in accordance with existing procedures and practices of the Company
with respect to the treatment of specific items on such Buyer Prepared
Returns,  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tunless otherwise required by applicable Law; provided that the IRS
Form 1120 (and any comparable state and local Tax Returns) of CCI for the
taxable period ending December 31, 2017 (the "CCI 2017 Returns") shall not be
required to be prepared in accordance with existing procedures and practices
of the Company and shall be prepared in accordance with an appropriate
transfer pricing study satisfying the requirements of Treas. Reg. §
1.6662-6(d)(2)(iii). Each Buyer Prepared Return that shows an Indemnified Tax
and is not prepared in accordance with existing procedures and practices of
the Company shall be submitted to the Seller for the review and comment of the
Seller at least ten (10) days prior to the due date of such Tax Return and
Buyer shall incorporate any reasonable comments made by the Seller to such
Buyer Prepared Return. No failure or delay of the Buyer in providing Buyer
Prepared Returns for the review of the Seller shall reduce or otherwise affect
the obligations or liabilities of the Seller pursuant to this Agreement,
except to the extent the Seller were actually prejudiced by such failure or
delay. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, the
Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare, or cause to be prepared
and pay all Taxes that are payable with respect to an amended IRS Form 1120
(and any comparable state and local Tax Returns) of CCI for the taxable
periods ending December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016 (the "CCI Amended
Returns"). The CCI Amended Returns shall reflect revenue and expenses
attributable to CCI and shall be provided to the Buyer for review and approval
by February 15, 2018, and the Seller shall incorporate any reasonably comments
made by the Buyer to such CCI Amended Returns; provided that the Seller shall
not be required to incorporate any such comments to the extent relating to the
management fee payable by CCI. To the extent required by Law, the Buyer shall
cause CCI to file, in the form approved by Buyer, all CCI Amended Returns to
be filed after the Closing Date prepared by the Seller and timely delivered to
the Buyer in accordance with this Section 9.4(c). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.5. Tax Contests.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) If any Governmental Entity issues to the Target Companies
(i) a written notice of its intent to audit or conduct another Proceeding with
respect to Taxes of the Target Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period or (ii) a written notice of deficiency for Taxes for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, the Buyer or the Company shall notify
the Seller of its receipt of such communication from the Governmental Entity
within thirty (30) days of receipt. No failure or delay of the Buyer or the
Company in the performance of the foregoing shall reduce or otherwise affect
the obligations or liabilities of the Seller pursuant to this Agreement.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Company or its applicable Subsidiary shall control any
audit or other Proceeding in respect of any Taxes of the Target Companies (a
"Tax Contest"); provided, however, if the Tax Contest relates to a Flow-
Through Return of the Target Companies, (i) the Seller, at its sole cost and
expense, shall have the right to participate in any such Tax Contest to the
extent it relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and (ii) the Buyer shall not
allow the Company or its applicable Subsidiary to settle or otherwise resolve
any such Tax Contest if such settlement or other resolution results in an
Indemnified Tax without the permission of the Seller (which will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.6. Purchase Price Allocation. For income Tax purposes,
the Parties agree that the sale of the Units is intended to be treated as a
sale and purchase of assets. Within sixty (60)  \t\t

 \t\t\tdays after the determination of Final Closing Net Working Capital, the
Buyer shall, after consultation with the Seller, deliver to the Seller a
schedule allocating the Purchase Price (and any assumed liabilities of the
Company) among the assets of the Company and applicable covenants in Section
6.2 for income Tax purposes in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the "Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule"). Subject to the Seller's approval of the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule, the Buyer and the Seller shall each report, act, and
file all Tax Returns and information reports consistently with the Purchase
Price Allocation Schedule (as appropriately adjusted) and shall not take any
position during the course of any audit or other Proceeding that is
inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, unless required to
do so by applicable Law or a final determination of an applicable Governmental
Entity; provided, that if the parties are unable to agree on the Purchase
Price Allocation Schedule after consulting with each other in good faith, the
parties shall submit the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule to Grant Thornton
for review, and Grant Thornton's determination shall be binding on the
parties. The Buyer and the Seller shall make appropriate adjustments to the
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule to reflect adjustments to the Purchase
Price. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.7. Tax Distributions. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, no Seller or Stockholder shall retain any right to any distribution
for Taxes pursuant to the terms of the Company's operating agreement after
Closing. \t\t

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(a)(i) if the Company,
the Seller or the Stockholders is then in material breach of any of its or his
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;  \t\t

any action of such Party or the failure of such Party (including, for purposes
of the Company, any action or failure of the Seller or the Stockholders) to
perform any of its or his obligations under this Agreement required to be
performed at or prior to the Closing has been the cause of, or resulted in,
the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Termination Date and such
action or failure to perform constitutes a breach of this Agreement; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) by the Company or the Buyer if there shall be in effect a

accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the foregoing, all
disputes against a Debt Financing Source under the Financing or related to
this Agreement or the facts and circumstances leading to its execution,
whether in contract, tort or otherwise (including any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to the Financing), will be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York applicable to Contracts
executed in and to be performed entirely within such State, without regard to
conflict of Law principles that would result in the application of any Law

HOLDINGS, PETIQ, THE COMPANY, THE SELLER AND THE STOCKHOLDERS FURTHER
IRREVOCABLY CONSENT TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL,
POSTAGE PREPAID, OR BY PERSONAL SERVICE WITHIN OR OUTSIDE THE STATE OF

STOCKHOLDERS HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY HAVE OR HEREAFTER MAY HAVE TO THE
LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT REFERRED TO
ABOVE AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH LITIGATION HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN
INCONVENIENT FORUM. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE BUYER, HOLDINGS, PETIQ, THE
COMPANY, THE SELLER OR THE STOCKHOLDERS HAS OR HEREAFTER MAY ACQUIRE ANY
IMMUNITY FROM JURISDICTION OF ANY COURT OR FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS (WHETHER
THROUGH SERVICE OR NOTICE, ATTACHMENT PRIOR TO JUDGMENT, ATTACHMENT IN AID OF
EXECUTION OR OTHERWISE) WITH RESPECT TO ITSELF OR ITS PROPERTY, THEN EACH OF
THE BUYER, HOLDINGS, PETIQ, THE SELLER AND THE STOCKHOLDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the-contrary, each Seller
Related Party and each of the other parties hereto (a) agrees that it will not
bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether

forum other than exclusively in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is
vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), (b) submits for
itself and its property with respect to any such action to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts, (c) agrees that service of process, summons,
notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at its address provided
in Section 11.7 shall be effective service of process against it for any such
action brought in any such court, (d) waives and hereby irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such court and (e) agrees
that a final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, EACH SELLER
RELATED PARTY AND EACH OTHER PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHTS OF TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLA IM (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE FINANCING OR ANY OF THE
OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.9. Specific Performance. The Parties acknowledge that the
rights of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are
unique and recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of this
Agreement by any Party, money damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching
Party may have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the Parties agree
that, each Party shall be entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement by a
decree of specific performance without the necessity of proving the inadequacy
of money damages as a remedy. Each Party hereby waives any requirement for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall Buyer,
Holdings or PetIQ be obligated pursuant to specific performance or otherwise
commence any Proceeding against any Debt Financing Source. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, no Seller Related Party shall have
any rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
and no Debt Financing Source shall have any rights or claims against any
Seller Related Party in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. No Debt Financing Source shall be subject to
any special, consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages of a
tortious nature. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.10. Amendments and Waivers. No amendment of any provision
of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and
signed by the Buyer and the Seller. No waiver by any Party of any default,
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or
affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any such prior or subsequent
occurrence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of this Section 11.10 or
Sections 11.2, 11.8 or 11.9 may be amended or waived  \t\t

consent of the affected Debt Financing Sources.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.11. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof to any Person or circumstance shall be invalid or
unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected thereby and shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by Law
so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid or
unenforceable, the Buyer and the Seller shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.12. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, each
of the Buyer, Holdings, PetIQ, the Company, the Seller and the Stockholders
will bear its own costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses)
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, that the Seller and the Stockholders shall bear the costs
and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) of the Company incurred prior
to and in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.13. Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.14. Conflict Waiver; Privilege. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its directors, members, partners, officers, employees,
and Affiliates that Carle, Mackie, Power and Ross, LLP ("CMPR") represents the
Company, the Seller and the Stockholders. After the Closing, it is possible
that CMPR will represent the Seller Indemnified Parties in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or by any of the Ancillary Documents to which
they may be party, including, without limit, any claims made hereunder or
thereunder, and the exercise of their respective rights hereunder or
thereunder. Each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties waives any conflict of
interest arising therefrom. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, the Buyer Indemnified Parties do not waive, nor shall be required to
waive, any right to object to the representation by CMPR of any of the Seller
Indemnified Parties to the extent that CMPR has a conflict of interest with
the Buyer Indemnified Parties arising other than (i) from CMPR representation
of the Company, the Seller and the Stockholders in the preparation,
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, or (ii) the fact of CMPR's representation of the Stockholders, the
Seller and/or the Target Companies prior to Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Buyer Indemnified Parties hereby irrevocably acknowledge
and agree (i) that any attorney-client privilege arising from oral or written
communications prior to the Closing Date between any one or more officers,
directors, employees, equity holders (including  \t\t

 \t\t\tthe Stockholders) of the Target Companies, on the one hand, and CMPR,
on the other hand, which relate to this Agreement and Exhibits hereto and
including the Disclosure Schedules) or the transactions contemplated hereby
(collectively, the "Designated Communications"), shall be excluded from any of
the property, rights, privileges, powers, franchises and other interests that
are possessed by and/or vested in the Target Companies at the Closing Date for
the purposes of any applicable Law, (ii) that such attorney-client privilege
shall be deemed held by the Seller Indemnified Parties, and that no Buyer
Indemnified Party shall have any right to waive any such attorney-client
privilege at any time after the Closing Date, (iii) not to offer into evidence
any Designated Communication protected by any such attorney-client privilege
in any Proceeding involving any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties or the Seller
Indemnified Parties, and (iv) to waive any right to discover or otherwise
obtain from any such Persons any Designated Communication protected by such
attorney-client privilege. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall have the right to waive any such attorney-client
privilege, offer into evidence any such Designated Communication protected by
such attorney-client privilege, and discover or otherwise obtain from any such
Persons any Designated Communication protected by such attorney-client
privilege as reasonably necessary to defend the Target Companies against any
Proceedings against them, including in connection with any counterclaims made
in any such Proceedings. Except as set forth in the foregoing sentence, in
the event that any Proceedings arise after the Closing Date between any of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties and a Person other than one of the Seller
Indemnified Parties, none of the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall disclose any
Designated Communication that is subject to an attorney-client privilege
without the prior written consent of the Stockholders; provided, however,
that if any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties is required by judicial order or
other legal process to make such disclosure, the Buyer shall, if permitted by
applicable Law, promptly notify the Stockholders in writing of such
requirement (without making disclosure) and shall provide the Stockholders
with such reasonable cooperation and assistance as shall be necessary to
enable the Seller Indemnified Parties to seek to prevent disclosure by reason
of such attorney-client privilege. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the Designated Communications do not include
communications between the Target Companies and/or the Seller or the
Stockholders, on the one hand, and CMPR, on the other hand, relating to
general business matters of the Target Companies. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The Buyer, Holdings and PetIQ acknowledge and agree that
they have participated fully in the negotiation of this Section 11.14, they
have been represented by sophisticated legal counsel in connection with the
preparation hereof and each has had an opportunity to ask such questions and
receive such answers of such counsel as they deemed necessary. \t\t
