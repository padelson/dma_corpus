ARTICLE IV

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES



4.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or
their respective stockholders:



(a)  _Merger Consideration_. Subject to _Sections 4.1(d),_ each share of the
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or,
collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub  



 

2  or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or Shares
that are owned by the Company or any direct or indirect subsidiary of the
Company and, in each case, not held on behalf of third parties (each, an "
_Excluded Share_ " and collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall
automatically be converted into, and become exchangeable for $14.50 in cash,
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all
Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this _Section 4.1(a)_ shall cease to be outstanding and shall be
automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of such Shares
(other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares, except the right to receive upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with _Section 4.2(b)_ hereof, the Merger
Consideration issued in consideration therefore in accordance with this
ARTICLE IV. The Company shall cause all Rights, as defined in the Rights
Agreement dated as of November 17, 1998 between the Company and U.S. Stock
Transfer Corporation, as rights agent (the " _Company Rights Agreement_ "),
(the " _Company Rights_ "), to expire and the Company Rights Agreement to
terminate effective immediately prior to the Closing and Effective Time
hereunder.



(b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be
outstanding, shall be automatically cancelled and retired without payment of
any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.



(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.



(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Shares that have not been voted for adoption of this
Agreement and with respect to which appraisal shall have been properly
demanded in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at
or after the Effective Time unless and until the holder of such Shares
withdraws his demand for such appraisal (in accordance with Section 262(k) of
the DGCL) or becomes ineligible for such appraisal. If a holder of
Dissenting Shares shall withdraw (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the
DGCL) his demand for such appraisal or shall become ineligible for such
appraisal, then, as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event,
whichever last occurs, each of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease to
be a Dissenting Share and shall be converted into and represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice
of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not make any payments with respect
to, or compromise or settle, any demand for appraisal without the written
consent of Parent. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled,
pursuant to the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, to payment for such
Dissenting Shares under the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL shall
receive payment thereof from the Surviving Corporation and such Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist.



4.2 _Exchange of Certificates for Shares_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, in trust with an exchange agent selected by Parent and
reasonably satisfactory to the  



 

3  Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), cash sufficient to deliver the aggregate
Merger Consideration. Such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ". Until terminated pursuant to _Section 4.2(d)_ , the
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than payment of the
Merger Consideration. The Exchange Agent shall invest any funds held by it
for purposes of this _Section 4.2(a)_ as directed by Parent, on a daily
basis; _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent upon termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to _Section 4.2(d)_. In
the event the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy
all of the payment obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent hereunder,
Parent shall promptly deposit additional cash into the Exchange Fund in an
amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to
fully satisfy such payment obligations.



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other
than holders of Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) (i) a letter of
transmittal specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent, such letter of
transmittal to be in such form and have such other customary provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this _ARTICLE IV_. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably requested by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the amount (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings) of cash equal to the amount of Merger Consideration into which
the number of Shares previously represented by such Certificate shall have
been converted pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_ and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or will
accrue on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Shares which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.2(b), each
Certificate (other than those representing Excluded Shares) shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the Merger Consideration.



For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) the term " _Person_ " shall mean any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or
nature, and (ii) the term " _Governmental Entity_ " shall mean any
foreign, federal, state or local governmental authority, any
transgovernmental authority or any court, administrative or regulatory agency
or commission or other governmental authority, agency or body, domestic or
foreign, whether legislative, executive, judicial or otherwise, including,
without limitation, the United States Food and Drug Administration (the "
_FDA_ ").



(c) _Transfers_. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer  



 

4  books of the Surviving Corporation of Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or
by applicable Law (as defined below). If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
_ARTICLE IV_. The Merger Consideration delivered upon the surrender of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _ARTICLE IV_ shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
theretofore represented by such Certificates.



For purposes of this Agreement, " _Law_ " shall mean any statute, law,
ordinance, rule, regulation or Order of any Governmental Entity. " _Order_ "
shall mean any judgment, order, writ, preliminary or permanent injunction,
award or decree of any Governmental Entity.



(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect to the Exchange Fund) that
remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be paid and/or delivered to Parent. Any stockholders of
the Company who have not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE IV_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of any cash payable pursuant to
_Sections 4.1_ and _4.2_ upon due surrender of their Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any
holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered (i) prior to seven years
after the Effective Time or (ii) immediately prior to such earlier time when
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, any shares, cash, dividends and/or distributions in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.



(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the delivery by such Person of an
agreement of indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or the
posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration into
which Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been
converted pursuant to this _ARTICLE IV_ upon due surrender of such
Certificate.



(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person who was a holder of Shares,
options or other securities or rights immediately prior to the Effective
Time, such amounts, if any, as the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Exchange Agent shall be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the  



 

5  Exchange Agent, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such consideration would otherwise have been paid.

unknown, asserted or unasserted, accrued, contingent, absolute, determined,
determinable, unliquidated or otherwise, whether due or to become due and
whether or not required to be disclosed (including those relating to matters
involving any environmental and occupational safety and health matters, or any
other facts or circumstances of which the Company has Knowledge that would
reasonably be expected to result in any claims against, or obligations or
liabilities of, the Company or any of its affiliates), except those which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect and, in the cases of (i) and (iii), those
arising in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

" _Employees_ ") or current or former directors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or with respect to which the Company or any Subsidiary has any
liability, including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), and deferred compensation, stock option, stock
purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock based, incentive and bonus plans,
(the " _Benefit Plans_ ") are listed in _Section 5.1(h)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter. True and complete copies of all Benefit Plans listed in
_Section 5.1_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, including, but not limited
to, any trust instruments and insurance contracts forming a part of any
Benefit Plans, and all amendments thereto have been provided to Parent.



(ii) All Benefit Plans are in compliance in all material respects with their
terms and with applicable Laws, including without limitation ERISA and the
Code. Each Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (" _Pension Plan_ ") and which is intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received or will timely
file for a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service
(the " _IRS_ "), and the Company is not aware of any circumstances likely to
result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter or the loss of
the qualification of such Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect
to any Benefit Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction
expired as of the date hereof, could subject the Company or any Subsidiary to
a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i)
of ERISA.



(iii) Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any entity which
is considered one employer with the Company or any Subsidiary under Section
4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ") (x)
maintains or contributes to, has any liability with respect to or has within
the past six years maintained or contributed to a Pension Plan that is subject
to Subtitles C or D of Title IV of ERISA or (y) maintains or has an obligation
to contribute to or has within the past six years maintained or had an
obligation to contribute to a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA. All contributions required to be made under the terms
of any Benefit Plan have been timely made or have been reflected in the
Companys audited financial statements. No Pension Plan has an "accumulated
funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412
of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA.



(iv) There is no material pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company or the
officers of any Subsidiary, threatened, litigation relating to the Benefit
Plans.



(v) Since the Audit Date, there has been no amendment to, announcement by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee
participation or  



 

13  coverage under, any Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense
of maintaining such Plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor
for the most recent fiscal year, except for increases directly resulting from
an increase in the number of persons employed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries or promotions of existing employees in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice. Except as specifically noted in
_Section 5.1(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the execution of
this Agreement, stockholder approval of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will (A) entitle any employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in
severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (B)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,
result in the acceleration or lapse of any repurchase right, increase the
amount payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of
the Benefit Plans, (C) limit or restrict the right of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, Parent to merge, amend or terminate any of the Benefit Plans, or (D)
result in payments under any of the Benefit Plans which would not be
deductible under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code.



(vi) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains any Benefit
Plans outside of the United States.



(i) _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.



(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation or
default of or has violated (A) any provision of its certificate or by-laws, in
any material respect, or (B) any Laws of any Governmental Entity, arbitrator
or other authority having jurisdiction over the Company or such Subsidiary
or any of its properties, as applicable, except in the case of (B), for any
such violation or default that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
and its Subsidiaries possess all licenses, certificates, permits, approvals,
registrations and other authorizations of all Governmental Entities necessary
to conduct their respective businesses, other than any such license,
certificate, permit, approval, registration or other authorization required
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Company Permits_ "), and neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation
or modification of any such license, certificate, permit or authorization,
except where the failure to possess, or the suspension, cancellation,
revocation or modification of, or failure to be valid or in full force and
effect, of any of the Company Permits, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the
Company Permits, except for such failures to comply which are, in the
aggregate, immaterial.



(ii) The Company and each of its officers and directors are in compliance
with, and have complied, in all material respects with (A) the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and
regulations promulgated under such Act (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") or the
Exchange Act, (B) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and
regulations of The NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc.s National Market. There are no
outstanding loans made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any  



 

14  executive officer (as defined under Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or
director of the Company. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has made any loans to
any executive officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act); such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
is made known to the Companys principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting the Companys principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer to material information required to be included in the
Companys periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. The Companys
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to the Companys auditors
and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (x) all
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data and have identified for the Companys auditors any
material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal controls. The Company has heretofore made
available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all such disclosures
to the Companys auditors and audit committee of the Board of Directors. For
purposes of this paragraph, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Exchange
Act.



(j) _Contracts_. Each material Contract (including all Material Contracts) to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
them or any of their properties may be bound is valid, binding and enforceable
and in full force and effect with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, with respect to the other
parties thereto, except where the failure thereof would not have or would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
default under any Material Contract, and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
there are no defaults thereunder, except for those defaults that would not
have or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Other than any Contract among
only the Company and/or any wholly-owned Company Subsidiary, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any Contract
that materially limits the ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to compete in or conduct any material line of its business or compete with any
person or in any geographic area or during any period of time.



(k) _Transactions with Affiliates_. Except to the extent disclosed in the
Company Filed Reports, there are and have been no transactions, agreements,
arrangements or understandings between the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and the affiliates of the Company (other than wholly-owned
Subsidiaries of the Company), on the other hand, that would be required to be
disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act.



 

15 (l) _Title to Properties; Encumbrances_.



(i) _Section 5.1(l)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of
all the real property (" _Real Property_ ") which is owned in fee by the
Company or its Subsidiaries. The Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, has good, marketable and insurable title to the Real Property. Except as
otherwise disclosed in _Section 5.1(l)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Real Property and Real Property Leases (as defined below) are free and clear
of all Liens, other than any Liens that would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(ii) The Company has heretofore delivered to Parent a true, correct and
complete copy of all leases and subleases (" _Real Property Leases_ ") under
which the Company or its Subsidiaries has the right to occupy space, including
all amendments thereto. All Real Property Leases are legal, valid, binding
obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
and enforceable against the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, in
accordance with their terms. Other than any defaults that would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse
effect on the tenants use of the leased premises under each Real Property
Lease, (A) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach or
default under any Real Property Leases and (B) to the Knowledge of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, there are no existing defaults or any condition or
event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time would constitute a
default, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries thereunder.



(iii) Except as set forth in _Section 5.1(l)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary owns or holds, nor is
obligated under or a party to, any option, right of first refusal or other
contractual right to purchase, acquire, sell or dispose of the Real Property
and the Real Property Leases or any portion thereof or interest therein.



(iv) Except with respect to Intellectual Property, the rights, properties and
other assets presently owned, leased or licensed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries include all rights, properties and other assets necessary to
permit the Company and its Subsidiaries to conduct their businesses in all
material respects in the same manner as their businesses have been conducted
prior to the date hereof.



(v) The Companys and its Subsidiaries possession and quiet enjoyment of the
Real Property under the Real Property Leases has not been disturbed, and to
the Knowledge of the Company there are no disputes with respect to the Real
Property Leases, other than any disputes that would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the
tenants use of the leased premises under each Real Property Lease. No
security deposit or portion thereof deposited with respect to each Real
Property Lease has been applied in respect of a breach or default under such
Real Property Lease without such security deposit being returned to its value
prior to such breach or default. The other party to each Real Property Lease
is not an affiliate of, nor otherwise has an economic interest in, the Company
or its Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries have not subleased,
licensed or otherwise granted any third party the right to use or occupy the
Real Property under the Real Property Leases. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have not collaterally assigned or granted any other security interest in any
Real Property Lease or any interest therein.



 

16 (m) _Major Suppliers_. The Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the ten
largest suppliers of the Company in terms of costs recognized for the
purchase of products or services during the fiscal year ended on the Audit
Date (the " _Suppliers_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has
not received any written or oral notice from any of the Suppliers of a plan
or intent to, and to the Knowledge of the Company none of the Suppliers plan
or intend to, terminate, cancel or otherwise adversely modify its relationship
with the Company or to decrease materially or limit its products to or
services to the Company.



(n) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
in writing by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the
Companys stockholders, at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting
(defined in _Section 6.4_ ) or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If, at
any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or
directors, should be discovered by the Company which, pursuant to the Exchange
Act, should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement,
the Company shall notify Parent in writing. All documents that the Company is
responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger will comply
as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to information
or statements with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries supplied by or on
behalf of Parent in writing specifically for inclusion therein.



(o) _Company Rights Agreement_. The Company has taken all action so that the
execution of this Agreement and the Voting and Support Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby do not and will not result in the grant of any rights to any Person
under the Company Rights Agreement or enable, require or cause the Company
Rights to be exercised, distributed or triggered. The Company has delivered to
Parent and Merger Sub true, complete and correct copies of the Company Rights
Agreement.



(p)  _Inventory_. All inventory, whether reflected on the balance sheet of

Disclosure Letter (including the notes thereto) (the " _Company Balance Sheet_
") or subsequently created or acquired, has been created or acquired in the
ordinary course of business and, except as provided in the Companys inventory
reserves as of the date hereof, is suitable, usable, or saleable for the
purposes for which it is intended. All inventory has been valued on the
Company Balance Sheet based on the lower of market value or the Companys cost
of the inventory. The markdowns and provisions for obsolescence and shrinkage
reflected on the Company Balance Sheet have been fairly determined consistent
with past practices in accordance with GAAP. The reserve for obsolescence and
shrinkage reflected on the Company Balance Sheet has been fairly determined
consistent with past practices in accordance with GAAP and is adequate in all
material respects to provide for excess, slow moving, obsolete, defective,
damaged or missing inventory.



(q) _Takeover Statutes_. No "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (including
Section 203 of the DGCL) (each a " _Takeover Statute_ ") or any anti-takeover
provision in the Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws is, or at
the Effective Time will be, applicable to this Agreement, the Voting and
Support  



 

17  Agreement, the Company, the Shares, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. The Company has taken all action so that
Parent will not be prohibited from entering into a "business combination"
with the Company as an "interested stockholder" (in each case as such term is

Agreement, the Voting and Support Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended,
or has received notice of any similar status under any other Environmental
Law. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has treated, stored,
disposed of, arranged for or permitted the disposal of, transported, handled,
released or exposed persons to any hazardous or toxic substances or wastes,
pollutants or contaminants, noise, odor or radiation in a manner that has
given or will give rise to material liabilities under Environmental Laws. The
Company has furnished to the Parent all environmental reports, audits and

Subsidiaries has manufactured, sold, used or handled material or products

other proceedings in respect of Taxes or Tax matters. There are not, to the

Companys or any of its Subsidiaries Tax liability that are reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(iii) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received from any foreign,
federal, state, or local taxing authority (including jurisdictions where

18  any Subsidiary has filed Tax Returns) any (A) notice indicating an intent to
open an audit or other review, (B) request for information related to
Tax matters, or (C) notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any
amount of Tax proposed, asserted, or assessed by any taxing authority against
the Company or any Subsidiary. _Section 5.1(s)_ of the Company Disclosure

applicable period specified in Code §897(c)(1)(A)(ii).



(vi) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries (A) did not, as of
the date of the latest Company Balance Sheet, exceed the reserve for Tax
liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the

not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the
Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of the Company
and its Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns. Since the date of the latest
Company Balance Sheet, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred
any liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business.

Company, are adequate to protect the properties and businesses of the Company
and its Subsidiaries; the Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with
the terms of such policies and instruments in all material respects and all

measures to protect the confidentiality of its trade secret and confidential
information contained within the IT Assets. The Company and its Subsidiaries

(ii) All reports, documents, claims and notices required to be filed,
maintained, or furnished to any Governmental Entity by the Company have been
so filed, maintained or furnished, except where the failure to file, maintain,
or furnish such documents would not, individually, or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(iii) To the Companys Knowledge, there are no facts which are reasonably
likely to cause: (A) the recall or suspension of any product sold or intended
to be sold by the Company or its Subsidiaries; (B) a change in the marketing
classification or a material change in labeling of any such products or (C) a
termination or suspension of marketing of any such products.

Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) an effect that would be

arising from (A) changes or developments in (x) the industries in which Parent
participates generally, (y) the financial, banking, currency or capital
markets or the economy in general, or (z) Laws of general applicability (or
interpretations thereof by Governmental Entities), which changes or
developments, in each case, do not disproportionately affect the Parent in

Parent or Merger Sub from, any Governmental Entity, in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, except those that the failure to make or obtain is not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.



(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict with,
result in a breach or violation or imposition of any Lien upon any property or

jurisdiction over Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
properties; except, in the case of clauses (B) and (C), for such conflict,
breach, violation or imposition that would not

Material Adverse Effect.

the Closing and at the Effective Time, Parent will have sufficient funds
available to pay the Merger Consideration upon consummation of the Merger.

with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal (defined below). The Company also agrees that it will
promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal to
return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries, subject to the terms
and conditions of such confidentiality agreements. As of the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time or earlier termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VIII_ , the Company shall not, nor shall it permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it or its Subsidiaries authorize any of
their respective Representatives to, and the Company and each Subsidiary shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or take any other
action to knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing information)
any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal which constitutes, any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding related to any Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
(iii) initiate or participate in any way in any negotiations or discussions
regarding an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or (iv)
amend or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or any similar
agreement with respect to any class of the Companys equity securities;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that, with respect to a bona fide, unsolicited
written Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof that does not result
from a breach of this _Section 6.3_ , at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company shall be entitled to (x) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement containing provisions not less
restrictive of such Person than those in the Confidentiality Agreement

30   _Section 9.7_ ), provided that all such information has previously been
provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially
concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate
in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal, in
each case commencing one business day after delivery of a written notice to
Parent that it intends to furnish such information or enter into such
discussions or negotiations (a " _Determination Notice_ "), if (but only if)
the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith by the
date on which the Determination Notice is given (A) after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal (defined below) and (B) after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to provide such information or enter into such
discussions or negotiations would present a reasonably substantial risk of a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the Companys Board of Directors to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing,
it is agreed that any violation of any provision or term in the preceding
sentence by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be a breach of this _Section 6.3(a)_ by the Company. The Company agrees

of the Company and its Subsidiaries of the obligations undertaken in this
_Section 6.3_ and in the Confidentiality Agreement.

inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group relating to (i) any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of greater than 50% of the total
consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or
15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated,
would result in any Person beneficially owning at least 15% of any class of
equity securities of the Company or (iii) any merger, reorganization, share
exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar
transaction pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company immediately
prior to such transaction would either (A) own less than 85% of any class of
equity securities of the entity surviving or resulting from such transaction
(or the ultimate parent entity thereof) or (B) receive consideration the value
of which is 15% or more of the aggregate equity value of the Company
immediately before giving effect to such transaction, in each case, other
than the Merger. A " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a bona fide,
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof and not
received in violation of _Section 6.3(a)_ , made by a Person other than Parent
or Merger Sub, that provides for the acquisition, whether by merger, tender
offer, exchange offer, business combination, asset purchase, recapitalization
or similar transaction, of greater than 50% of all of the outstanding Shares
or greater than 50% of the total consolidated assets of the Company (i) that
is on terms which the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) to be more favorable for the stockholders of the Company (in
their capacity of stockholders) from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any alternative proposed by
Parent or Merger Sub in accordance with _Section 0_ hereof, (ii) which
is reasonably likely to be consummated in a timely manner (taking into
account the legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and
the identity of the offeror) and (iii) which is fully financed or reasonably
capable of being fully financed (and, in either such case, is not subject to
a financing contingency).



Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall
(x) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or propose to
withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of
Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions  



 

31  contemplated hereby or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly
to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described
in this clause (x) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") or (y) prior to paying the Termination Fee to the Parent and
terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(c), approve or recommend,
or propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other
than a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 6.3(a)_ ) (an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of
Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if
all of the following conditions in clauses (i) through (iii) are met: 



(i) the Company Stockholder Approval has not been obtained;



(ii) the Company has provided to Parent three business days prior written
notice (a " _Notice of Adverse Recommendation_ ") which shall expressly state
that it intends to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and the
manner in which it intends to do so; and



(iii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is required to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law.



(b) The Company agrees that in addition to the obligations of the Company set
forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this _Section 6.3_ , promptly on the date
of receipt thereof by the Company, any of its Subsidiary or their
Representatives, the Company shall (i) advise Parent orally and in writing of
any request for information or other inquiry that could reasonably be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry, discussions or negotiations with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
and the terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
discussions or negotiations (including any changes thereto) and (ii) promptly
provide to Parent copies of any written materials (including written materials
provided by email or otherwise in electronic format) received by the Company
in connection with any of the foregoing, and the identity of the Person or
group making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or with whom
any discussion or negotiations are taking place. The Company agrees that it
shall keep Parent fully informed of the status and details (including
amendment or proposed amendments) of any such request, Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry and keep Parent fully informed as to the details of any information
requested of or provided by the Company and as to the details of all
discussions or negotiations with respect to any such request, Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall provide Parent with 48 hours prior
written notice (or such other prior notice as is reasonably practicable in
light of notice of less than 48 hours provided to members of the Board of
Directors) of any meeting of its Board of Directors at which its Board of
Directors is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal.



(c) Subject to _Section 6.9_ , nothing contained in this _Section 6.3_ shall
prohibit the Company from (i) complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company
if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors  



 

32  (after consultation with outside legal counsel), such disclosure would be
required under applicable Law; _provided_ _however_ , that in no event shall
the Company or its Board of Directors or committee thereof take, or agree or
resolve to take, any action prohibited by this _Section 6.3_.



6.4 _Company Stockholders  Meeting_. Prior to the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ , the Company shall take, in
accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and by-
laws, all action necessary to establish a record date for, duly call, give
notice of, hold and convene a meeting of the Companys stockholders (the "
_Company Stockholders  Meeting_") as promptly as practicable to consider and
vote upon the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger and
shall, at the Company Stockholders Meeting, submit this Agreement for
consideration and vote by the Companys stockholders at such meeting. Subject
to _Section 6.3_ , the Companys Board of Directors shall recommend to its
stockholders the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger and
shall not amend, modify, withdraw, condition or qualify such recommendation
and shall take commercially reasonable action to solicit such approval in
accordance with applicable Law, rules of the NASDAQ National Market and the
Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws (including, without
limitation, including such recommendation in the Proxy Statement).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ ,
the obligation of the Company to convene the Company Stockholders Meeting
and to submit this Agreement for the consideration and vote of the Companys
stockholders at such meeting shall not be limited or otherwise affected by
the commencement, disclosure, announcement, proposal or communication to it
of any Acquisition Proposal, or by any withdrawal or change of recommendation
of the Companys Board of Directors or committee thereof. The Company shall
ensure that the Company Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened,
held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited in connection with the
Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with applicable Law,
the rules of the NASDAQ National Market and the Companys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws. Without the prior written consent of Parent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger and the election of the directors of the Company (if
the Company Stockholders Meeting constitutes the Companys 2004 Annual
meeting of stockholders) are the only matters which the Company shall propose
to be acted on by the Companys stockholders at the Company Stockholders
Meeting (other than matters incident thereto, including the adjournment of the
Company Stockholders Meeting to solicit additional proxies in support of this
Agreement). The Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any
Acquisition Proposal or propose to do so.



6.5  _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.



(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall, after
consultation with Parent, prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement
relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting (together with any
amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "), and,
in accordance with applicable Law, the Company shall promptly mail the Proxy
Statement to its stockholders. The Proxy Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto shall include all information pertaining to the Company
and the transactions contemplated hereby required by the Exchange Act for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. Company shall
also, if required, mail to the Companys stockholders, any amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement which may become necessary.



(b) No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by the
Company without the prior approval of the Parent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or  



 

33  delayed. Each party will advise the other party, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for amendment or supplement of
the Proxy Statement or comments of the SEC thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time, the Company or Parent discovers any information relating to
itself, or any of its affiliates, officers or directors, that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, such party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
the parties shall jointly prepare an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information which shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to
the extent required by law or regulation, disseminated to the stockholders of
the Company.



(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall, upon request by the other and
subject to applicable Law, furnish the other with all information concerning
itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
preparation of Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 



6.6 _Reasonable Efforts; Notifications_. 



(a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause
to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this
Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable,
including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable
all documentation to effect all required notices, reports and other filings
and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, registrations,
approvals, permits and authorizations required to be obtained from any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) using
reasonable best efforts to cause the satisfaction of all conditions to
Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 6.6_ shall
require, or be construed to require, Parent to proffer to, or agree to, sell,
license or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate and agree to sell, license
or otherwise dispose of, before or after the Effective Time, any assets,
businesses, or interest in any assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective affiliates (or to consent to any sale, or agreement to
sell, by the Company of any of its assets or businesses) or to agree to any
material changes or restriction in the operations of any such assets or
businesses. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent
and the Company shall file any Notification and Report Forms and related
materials that it may be required to file in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice under the HSR
Act as soon as practicable after the date hereof, but in no event later than
12 business days after the date hereof, shall each use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain an early termination of the applicable waiting
period, and shall each make as promptly as practicable, any submissions
pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper or advisable. Subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent and the
Company shall (i) have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on, all the information relating to
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made  



 

34  with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) consult with each other before
meeting with, or engaging in any conference calls with, any antitrust agency
to discuss the transactions contemplated hereby. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable.



(b) The Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notice or other
communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any
of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including information relating to (i) the Companys and its
Subsidiaries licenses, certificates, permits or other authorizations from or
of Governmental Entities and any applications relating thereto, unless the
Company reasonably determines that furnishing such copies would violate the
terms of a written confidentiality obligation of the Company to such third
party or applicable Law, or (ii) any written claim by a third party that a
Material Contract has been breached, is in default, may not be renewed or
that a consent would be required as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. If any party or affiliate thereof receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such
party will endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request. Nothing herein shall
require any party to waive any substantial rights or agree to any substantial
limitation on its (or the Surviving Corporations) operations or to divest
itself of any assets or properties. 



(c) Each party hereto shall promptly advise the other parties hereto orally
and in writing of any occurrence or existence of any event which makes or,
with the passage of time or otherwise, is reasonably likely to make any
representation or warranty made by such party contained herein untrue; 
_provided_ _however_ that the delivery of notice pursuant to this _Section
6.6(c)_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder
to the party receiving such notice.



6.7 _Tax Covenants_.



(a) The Company shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed in a
manner consistent with past practice all Tax Returns (whether separate or
consolidated, combined, group or unitary Tax Returns that include the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries) that are required to be filed (with extensions)
on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall have
a reasonable opportunity, beginning at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
due date thereof, to review and comment on the form and substance of such Tax
Returns.



(b) All Contracts or intercompany account systems under which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries may at any time have an obligation to indemnify for or
share the payment of or liability for any portion of a Tax (or any amount
calculated with reference to any portion of a Tax) shall be terminated with
respect to the Company and each such Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing
Date, and the Company and each Subsidiary shall thereafter be released from
any liability thereunder.



(c) Except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
(unless required by applicable Law or the regulations or requirements of any
stock exchange or regulatory organization applicable to the Company and its
Subsidiaries), without obtaining Parents prior written  



 

35  consent, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, make, change or revoke any election in respect of Taxes, file any
amended Tax Return, adopt or change any material accounting method or period
in respect of Taxes, enter into any closing agreement, settle or compromise
any claim or assessment in respect of Taxes, consent to any extension or
waiver of any statute of limitation applicable to any material claim or
assessment in respect of Taxes or surrender its rights to claim any refund in
respect of Taxes.



6.8 _Access_. Upon reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be required
by applicable Law, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
afford Parents officers, employees, counsel, accountants, agents and other
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to all of the
properties, personnel, agents, books, Contracts and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and, shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to Parent all information concerning the business, properties and
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as may reasonably be requested.
All requests for information made pursuant to this Section shall be directed
to an executive officer of the Company or such Person as may be designated by
its officers, as the case may be. All such information shall be governed by
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.



6.9 _Publicity_. The Company and Parent each shall consult with each other
prior to issuing, and will provide each other the opportunity to review,
comment upon and concur with, and use commercially reasonable efforts to agree
on, any press releases or other public announcements with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and prior to
making any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with
respect thereto, and shall not issue such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation except (i) as may be required by
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of the
NASDAQ National Market and (ii) each of Parent and the Company may make any
public statement in response to specific questions by the press, analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst
conference calls, so long as such statements are not inconsistent with
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly
by Parent and the Company (or individually, if previously approved by the
other party) and do not reveal non-public information regarding the other
party.



6.10 _Benefits_.



(a) _Stock Options and Warrants_.



(i) As of the date of this Agreement (or as soon as practicable after the date
hereof), the Board of Directors of the Company or its Compensation Committee
shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to
effect the provisions of this _Section 6.10(a)(i)_.



 

(A) At the Effective Time, each Company Option which is held by a current
member of the Board of Directors of the Company and which is outstanding
under a Stock Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each Company
Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
cancelled in exchange for a single lump sum cash payment equal to (subject to
applicable withholding tax) the product of (I) the number of Shares subject
to such Company Option or  



 

36  Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time and (II) the excess,
if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of
such Company Option or Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective
Time; provided that, if the exercise price per Share of such Company Option or
Company Warrant is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such
Company Option or Company Warrant shall be cancelled or forfeited without any
cash payment being made in respect thereof. The Surviving Corporation shall
make the foregoing payment at, or as soon as practicable after, the Effective
Time upon delivery by the holder of such Company Option or Company Warrant of
the certificate or other documents representing such Company Option or Company
Warrant.



(B) Each Company Option which is held by any Person other than a current
member of the Board of Directors of the Company and which is outstanding
under a Stock Plan shall, at the Effective Time (I) with respect to the vested
portion thereof, be cancelled in exchange for a single lump sum cash payment
equal to (subject to applicable withholding tax) the product of (a) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price
of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) the
number of Shares issuable upon exercise of the vested portion of such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that, if the
exercise price per Share of such Company Option is equal to or greater than
the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled or forfeited
without any cash payment being made in respect thereof, and (II) with respect
to the unvested portion thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into an
option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under
such Company Option, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product of (a) the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) and (b) the number of
Shares subject to the unvested portion of such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time (rounded down to the nearest whole number), at a
price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise
price per Share of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
_divided_ _by_ the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case
of any Company Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the option
price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms
and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in accordance
with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to
satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. The Surviving
Corporation shall make the foregoing payment at, or as soon as practicable
after, the Effective Time upon delivery by the holder of such Company Option
of the certificate or other documents representing such Company Option.



The " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall be defined as an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration _divided_ _by_ the Closing Parent Price. The " _Closing Parent
Price_ " shall be defined as the amount equal to the average of the per share
closing prices of the Parent Common Stock as reported by the NASDAQ National
Market for the five trading days ending two trading days prior to the Closing
Date, rounded to the fourth decimal point. 



(C) At or prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall
make all necessary arrangements and take all necessary actions to cause the
conversion and assumption of the unvested Company Options by Parent pursuant
to Section 6.10(a)(i)(B). Except with respect to Company Options that
accelerate in vesting pursuant to the specific terms of their respective
option award agreements or the applicable Stock Plan, and except as provided
in _Sections 6.10(a)(i)(A_ ) and _6.10(a)(i)(B)(I)_ , the Company shall not
take any actions that would result in the accelerated vesting or cashing out
of any Company Options.



(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all commercially
reasonable actions as may be required and permitted under applicable Law to
cause the  



 

37  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispositions of
Shares (including derivative securities with respect to such Shares) by
each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.



(iii) The Board of Directors of the Company or its Compensation Committee
shall take all action necessary to provide that immediately upon the
expiration of the current Offering Period under the Company ESPP, the Company
ESPP shall be terminated, or, if permitted under the terms of the Company
ESPP, indefinitely suspended, and no further payroll deductions shall be
permitted thereunder and no options shall be granted thereunder.



(iv) If and to the extent the agreement, consent or approval of any holder of
a Company Option or Company Warrant, or any participant under the Company
ESPP, is required to implement the provisions of this _Section 6.10(a)_ , then
the Company shall obtain all required agreements, consents and approvals from
such holders prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that the Company shall not
provide any consideration to holders of Company Options or Company Warrants to
obtain their consent without the prior written consent of Parent.



(v) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company Options assumed by it in
accordance with this Section. No later than five business days after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, in its sole discretion, either (A) file a
registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any
successor or other appropriate forms), or another appropriate form to register
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon the exercise thereof, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration
statement to be effective as soon as practicable after the Effective Time and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Company
Options remain outstanding or (B) issue shares of Parent Common Stock under an
existing registration statement upon the exercise of such options.



(b)  _Benefit Plans_.



(i) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause service performed by
current employees for the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor
entities) to be taken into account for purposes of eligibility and vesting,
and for purposes of determining severance, vacation and other paid time off
entitlements, under the benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries in which
employees of the Company participate to the extent such service was credited
by the Company and its Subsidiaries under similar Benefit Plans.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.10(b)(i)_ shall be
construed to require crediting of service that would result in (A) duplication
of benefits, (B) service credit for benefit accruals under a defined benefit
pension plan, (C) service credit under a newly established plan for which
prior service is not taken into account or (D) employer contribution for any
401(k) plan. In addition, nothing herein shall limit the ability of Parent to
amend or terminate any of its welfare and pension benefit plans in accordance
with their terms at any time.



 

38 (ii) When employees of the Company become eligible to participate in a
medical, dental or health plan of Parent, to the extent permissible under the
applicable benefit plan, Parent shall cause each such plan to (x) waive any
preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions were covered
under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of the Company and (y)
waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement
which would otherwise be applicable to such employee on or after the Effective
Time to the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation or
requirement under an analogous Company plan prior to the Effective Time.



(iii) Parent shall continue to provide automobile lease subsidies and/or
related payments to the Companys current and former officers in amounts no
less than that provided by the Company to each such current or former officer
immediately prior to the Effective Time until the later of (A) each such
officers termination of employment with Merger Sub or Parent or (B) the
expiration of the current lease term for such automobile.



(iv) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to provide that as of the Effective Time, each participant in the Interpore
International, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (the "Company 401(k) Plan") shall
have a fully vested and non-forfeitable right in his or her matching
contribution account under such plan.



(c) The Company shall freeze participation under the Companys 401(k) plan
effective as of the Effective Time and Company employees shall be eligible to
participate under Parents 401(k) plan beginning on the day following the
Effective Time. Immediately following the Effective Time, employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall continue to participate in the
welfare benefit plans in which they participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time or the Parent may transition the employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to other employee benefits that are comparable to those
provided to Parents similarly situated employees. Nothing herein shall
require Parent or Company to continue any particular Benefit Plan or prevent
the amendment or termination thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
shall not take any action (by way of amendment, termination or otherwise)
which is in violation of the terms of any Benefit Plan or applicable Law.



6.11 _Expenses_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the transactions
contemplated in _ARTICLE IV_ , and Parent shall reimburse the Surviving
Corporation for such charges and expenses. Except as otherwise provided in
_Section 8.5(b)_ , whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such expense.



6.12 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.



(a) For a period of not less than six years from and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present
and former director and officer of the Company (when acting in such capacity)
determined as of the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, settlements, damages or liabilities (collectively, "
_Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(collectively, " _Claims_ "), arising out of matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated
hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the  



 

39  Effective Time, to the fullest extent and only to the extent permitted under
applicable Law (and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses
as incurred to the extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ the
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification). 



(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the Companys
existing officers and directors liability insurance for a period of six
years after the Effective Time so long as the annual premium therefor is not
in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date hereof,
in which case Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain in the
aggregate as much comparable insurance as available for such amount.



(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) shall transfer any of its material properties or assets to any Person,
individually or in the aggregate, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation or the Person acquiring such properties or assets shall assume,
jointly and severally, all of the obligations set forth in this Section. 



(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.12_ are intended for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Indemnified
Party may have had by contract or otherwise.



6.13 _Takeover Statute_.



(a) Each of Parent, the Company and their respective Board of Directors shall
take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute
or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. If any Takeover Statute becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company and their
respective Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on such transactions. In addition, the Company will not approve an
Acquisition Proposal or a Superior Proposal for purposes of Section 203 of the
DGCL.



(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not redeem the Company
Rights or amend, modify (other than to delay any "distribution date" therein
or to render the Company Rights inapplicable to the Merger or any action
permitted under this Agreement) or terminate the Company Rights Agreement.



6.14 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and
in writing of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its
directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and

employees, agents, legal and financial advisors or other Representatives), 
_provided_ , _however_ , no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of
any liability or damages resulting from any willful breach of this Agreement.



(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_ or,
with respect to any breach of _Section 6.3_ which is not inadvertent,

of $8 million (the " _Termination Fee_ "), payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the Parent.



(c) If the Company elects to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.3(c)_ , then the Company shall, as a condition precedent to such
termination, pay Parent the Termination Fee, payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent.



(d) In the event that an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its stockholders or any Person
shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to
make an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company or  



 

45  any of its Subsidiaries and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by
either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.2(b)_
or this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.4(c)_ and,
within 12 months of the termination of the Agreement, the Company enters into
an agreement providing for, or consummates, an Acquisition Proposal (other
than a public by the Company of newly-issued securities that represent less
than 30% of the outstanding capital stock of the Company as of the date
hereof, the primary purpose of which is to raise capital) (whether or not such
Acquisition Agreement related to an Acquisition Proposal that had been made
or announced at the time of the termination of this Agreement), then the
Company shall, upon the earlier to occur of such execution or consummation,
pay Parent the Termination Fee, payable by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent.



(e) If this Agreement is terminated by (i) Parent pursuant to _Section 8.4(c)_
or (ii) the Company pursuant to _Sections 8.3(a)_  or _8.3(b)_ , then the
non-terminating party shall promptly, but in no event later than two days
after being notified of such by the terminating party, pay all of the charges
and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, its financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants and other advisors, incurred by the terminating party
and its affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, not to exceed $2 million, payable by wire

accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the Termination Fee pursuant
to _Sections 8.5(b)_ , _8.5(c)_ or _8.5(d)_ , and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit which results in a judgment
against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent
or Merger Sub its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime
rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal on the date such payment was
required to be made.
