subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the " _DGCL_ ");

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have determined that the Merger is in the best interest of their respective
stockholders and have declared advisable and approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger), and have recommended
the adoption of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) by their respective stockholders;

WHEREAS, immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company shall obtain the irrevocable approval and adoption by the holders of
Voting Common Stock of this Agreement and the Merger contemplated hereby,
pursuant to a written consent in the form of _Exhibit A_ to this Agreement
(each, a " _Written Consent_ ") signed by the Required Holders; and

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as an
inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement, each of
the GS Funds and each of the Advent Funds (collectively, the " _Limited
Guarantors_ ") have agreed, pursuant to guarantees dated as of the date hereof
(collectively, the " _Limited Guarantees_ "), to guaranty the performance by
Parent and Merger Sub of certain obligations under this Agreement, as more
fully set forth in the Limited Guarantees.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby agree
as follows:

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company at the Effective Time. As a result of the Merger,
the separate corporate existence of  Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation of the Merger (referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_
").

 

1.2 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to
_Section 10.1_, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in _Article 8_ , the closing of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the
offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 233 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois
60606 commencing at 10:00 a.m. local time on (a) the third (3rd) Business Day
following the date on which all of the conditions set forth in _Article 8_
are satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms
cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions); _provided_ , that if the Marketing Period has not
ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set
forth in _Article 8_ (other than those conditions that by their terms cannot
be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions), then the Closing shall occur on the earlier of (i) a date
during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on no fewer than two (2)
Business Days prior notice to the Company, and (ii) on or before the third
(3rd) Business Day following the final day of the Marketing Period (subject
in each case to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth
in _Article 8_ for the Closing as of the date determined pursuant to this
proviso) or (b) such later date as may be mutually agreed in writing by
Parent and the Company (the date on which the Closing actually occurs is the "
_Closing Date_ ").

 

1.3 _Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, the Company shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of, the DGCL (the date and time of such filing, or at such
later date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger, the " _Effective Time_ "). 

1.4 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, all properties, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, restrictions, liabilities and duties
of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, restrictions,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws_. The certificate of incorporation
of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
be amended at the Effective Time to read in its entirety as set forth on
_Exhibit B_ hereto and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by Applicable Law. The by-laws of the Company, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended at the
Effective Time to read in their entirety as set forth on _Exhibit C_ hereto
and, as so amended, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by Applicable Law.

 



2 1.6 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal. 

ARTICLE 2

EFFECT OF MERGER ON THE EQUITY SECURITIES OF

THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

2.1 _Conversion of Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) Shares of Common Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into, and be exchanged
for, one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of voting
common stock of the Surviving Corporation such that, immediately following the
Effective Time, Parent will be the sole and exclusive owner of the shares of
all common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of
Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall, as of the Effective
Time, evidence ownership of such shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(b) Shares of Common Stock of the Company. Each share of Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
shares of Common Stock held as treasury stock or held or owned by the Company
or any subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time,
which shares shall be canceled without any payment being made in respect
thereof, or any Dissenting Shares (to the extent provided in _Section 2.4_))
shall automatically be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration. All shares of Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.1(b)_
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, and shall
cease to exist after the Effective Time.

 

2.2 _Vesting of Company Options_.

(a) _Vesting of Company Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each then outstanding and unexercised option (or portion thereof) to purchase
shares of Common Stock (collectively, the " _Company Options_ ") under the
TransUnion Corp. 2010 Management Equity Plan (as amended, the " _Company Stock
Incentive Plan_ ") that vests based solely on time (collectively, the " _Time
Options_ ") shall become fully vested and exercisable, and any portion of
each Company Option that vests based on performance criteria (collectively,
the " _Performance Options_ ") shall become fully vested and exercisable if
(x) such performance criteria are satisfied as of the Closing or (y) such
full vesting and exercisability is approved prior to the Closing (i) by the
Company and (ii) for any Covered Person to the extent that such full vesting
and exercisability, together with all other payments and benefits that such
Covered Person would be entitled in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, would potentially constitute a "parachute
payment" under Section 280G of the Code, pursuant to a Stockholder vote in
accordance with the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the

 



3  Code. From and after the Effective Time, the Company Options shall no longer
be exercisable by the former holders thereof (the " _Option Holders_ "), but
shall only entitle the Option Holders to the payment of the consideration, if
any, set forth in this _Section 2.2_. The Company shall take all actions as
may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 2.2_.

 

(b) _Treatment of Vested Options_. At the Effective Time, in connection with
the Merger and pursuant to the terms hereof and the Company Stock Incentive
Plan, all Time Options and any vested Performance Options (collectively, the "
_Vested Options_ ") shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the
right to receive the Per Option Merger Consideration,  _less_ any tax
withholdings required under Applicable Law.

(c) _Treatment of Unvested Options_. At the Effective Time, in connection
with the Merger and pursuant to the terms hereof and the Company Stock
Incentive Plan, each Performance Option which is not vested at the Closing, if
any, shall be cancelled and forfeited without any payment therefor.

 

2.3 _Payment and Exchange Procedures_.

(a) _Closing Payments_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall make, or
cause to be made, the following payments (collectively, the " _Closing
Payments_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds:

(i) subject to the conditions set forth in _Section 2.3(b)_, to the
MDP Stockholder, an amount equal to (x) the product of the Per Share Merger
Consideration and the number of shares of Common Stock held by the MDP
Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time, _minus_ (y) the MDP
Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of the SR Fund, in each case, as set forth in
the Closing Funds Certificate to be delivered pursuant to _Section 8.2(d)_
(the " _MDP Stockholder Payment Amount_ ");

 

(ii) subject to the conditions set forth in _Section 2.3(b)_, to each Other
Stockholder, an amount equal to (x) the product of the Per Share Merger
Consideration and the number of shares of Common Stock held by such Other
Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time, _minus_ (y) such Other
Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of the SR Fund, _minus_ (z) such Other
Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, in each case,
as set forth in the Closing Funds Certificate to be delivered pursuant to
_Section 8.2(d)_ (the " _Other Stockholder Payment Amount_ " and, together
with the MDP Stockholder Payment Amount, the " _Stockholder Payment Amount_
");

(iii) to the Surviving Corporation for payment to each Option Holder (net of
applicable withholding), an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the Per
Option Merger Consideration applicable to all Vested Options held by such
Option Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, as set forth in the
Closing Funds Certificate to be delivered pursuant to _Section 8.2(d)_ (the "
_Option Payment Amount_ ");

 

(iv) to the person or persons entitled thereto pursuant to the Closing Funds
Certificate to be delivered pursuant to  _Section 8.2(d)_, on behalf and for

Fund to an account designated by the Stockholder Representative.

(b)  _Stockholder Payment and Exchange of Certificates_.

(i) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver, or cause to be
delivered, to Parent properly completed letters of transmittal, in a customary
form as shall be agreed between the Parent and the Stockholder Representative
prior to the Closing (each, a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), including, among
other terms, written wire transfer instructions, for each Stockholder who (x)
is receiving payments under _Sections 2.3(a)(i)_ or _2.3(a)(ii)_ , and (y) has
submitted such Letter of Transmittal to the Company prior to the Closing.

(ii) At the Closing, the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to
Parent all original certificates evidencing shares of Common Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") as well as any documents reasonably requested by Parent as
may be necessary to document the transfer and/or termination of
such Certificates that have been submitted to the Company prior to the
Closing.

(iii) All payments to a Stockholder made pursuant to _Sections 2.3(a)(i)_ or
_2.3(a)(ii)_ shall be subject to (x) the Companys receipt of a properly
completed Letter of Transmittal from such Stockholder, and (y) Parents
receipt of such Stockholders Certificates, as well as any documents
reasonably requested by Parent as may be necessary to document the transfer
and/or termination of such Certificates, from such Stockholder. Until a
Stockholder delivers the Letter of Transmittal and Certificates and any
additional information or documentation required by this _Section 2.3(b)_,
such Stockholders Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such delivery the applicable
Stockholder Payment Amount. At any time after the Effective Time, upon receipt
by Parent of such Stockholders Letter of Transmittal and Certificates and any
additional information or documentation required by this _Section 2.3(b)_,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation will issue in exchange for such
Stockholders Certificate the applicable Stockholder Payment Amount to such

Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable and
customary amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Stockholder Payment
Amount. 

 



5 (c) _Option Holder Payment_. At the Closing, Parent shall pay to the
Surviving Corporation an amount equal to the aggregate of the amounts owed to
the Option Holders pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)(iii)_, which shall be paid by
the Surviving Corporation to the Option Holders as soon as practicable
following the Closing, but in any event within five (5) Business Days
following the Closing. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay by
a payroll payment to each Option Holder for such holders Option Payment
Amount, less any tax withholdings required under Applicable Law.

2.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time held by a holder (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who shall
not have voted or consented to adopt this Agreement and has the right to
demand and has properly demanded an appraisal of such shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
otherwise payable in exchange for such shares, but shall be converted into
the right to receive such consideration as may be due such Dissenting
Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL unless such Dissenting
Stockholder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such Dissenting
Stockholders right to such payment or appraisal. If, after the Effective
Time, such Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise
loses any such right to appraisal, each such share of such Dissenting
Stockholder shall no longer be considered a Dissenting Share and shall be
deemed to have converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.1_, with
such Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid to the applicable Stockholder
in accordance with _Section 2.3_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of shares of Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands or agree to do
or commit to do any of the foregoing except to the extent required by
Applicable Law.

2.5 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock
shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend thereon with a record date during such period, but excluding any
change that results from any exercise of Company Options outstanding as of the
date hereof, the Per Share Merger Consideration, the Per Option Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement on a
per security basis shall be appropriately adjusted.

2.6 _Closing of Company Stock Transfer Books_. At 5:00 p.m., Chicago time, on
the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed (except with respect to conversions or exercises of
derivative securities) and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Common Stock that were outstanding on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by law. On or after
the Effective Time, any Certificates presented

 



6  to the Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any reason shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this _Article 2_.

(f) There are no outstanding loans or advances made or granted by the Company
or any of its subsidiaries to any of their respective employees that exceed
$75,000.

Closing, would prevent the Company from obtaining, using or disclosing Company
Confidential Information to the same extent that the Company and its

Information immediately prior to such transaction and that would reasonably
be likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

hereof, between Parent, on the one hand, and each Limited Guarantor and
Opportunity Partners Offshore-B Co-Invest AIV, L.P., a Cayman Islands
limited partnership, on the other hand, and attached hereto as _Exhibit E_
(collectively, the " _Equity Financing Letters_ "), pursuant to which the
Limited Guarantors have committed, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, to invest in Parent the cash amounts set forth
in the Equity Financing Letters (the " _Equity Financing_ "), and (ii) the
executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, between Parent and
Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Deutsche
Bank Trust Company Americas and Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch
(collectively, the " _Lender Parties_ ") and attached hereto as _Exhibit F_
(the " _Debt Financing Letter_ " and together with the Equity Financing
Letters, the " _Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which the Lender
Parties have committed, upon the terms and

 



24  subject to the conditions set forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth
in the Debt Financing Letter (the " _Debt Financing_ " and together with the
Equity Financing, the " _Financing_ ").

(b) Neither of the Financing Commitments have been amended or modified prior
to the date of this Agreement, and, as of the date hereof, the respective
commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn,
terminated or rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, there are no
other agreements, side letters or arrangements to which Parent or Merger Sub
is a party relating to either of the Financing Commitments that could affect
the availability of the Financing. As of the date hereof, the Financing
Commitments are in full force and effect and constitute the legally valid and
binding obligations of Parent, of the other parties to the Equity Financing
Letters and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties to the Debt
Financing Letter. There are no conditions precedent or other
contractual contingencies between Parent and any other party to the Financing
Commitments or the executed fee letter, dated as of the date hereof, between
Merger Sub and the Lender Parties a redacted copy of which is attached hereto
as _Exhibit G_ (the " _Debt Fee Letter_ "), related to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing (including any " _flex_ " provisions contained in
the Debt Fee Letter), other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments and the Debt Fee Letter. The proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to
the agreements contemplated by the Financing Commitments, in the aggregate and
together with the available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
of the Company, will be sufficient for Parent to pay the Closing Payments and
all related fees and expenses at the Closing. As of the date hereof, no event
has occurred which would result in any breach or violation of or constitute a
default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become
a default) by Parent under the Financing Commitments, and Parent does not have
any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing Commitments
will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to Parent
on the Closing Date. Parent has fully paid all commitment fees or other fees
required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof pursuant to the Financing
Commitments.

 

4.8 _Ownership of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities_. Merger Sub was formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. All of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of
Merger Sub are owned directly by Parent. There are no options, warrants or
other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments to which Merger Sub
is a party relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other equity
interests in Merger Sub or obligating Merger Sub to grant, issue or sell any
shares of the capital stock, or other equity interests in Merger Sub, by sale
or otherwise. There are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of Merger
Sub to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of the capital stock
of Merger Sub. Except for obligations or liabilities incurred in connection
with its incorporation or organization and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Merger Sub has not and will not have incurred, directly or
indirectly, through any affiliate, any obligations or liabilities or engaged
in any business activities of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into any
agreements or arrangements with any person.

4.9 _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub are entering into this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby with the actual intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries.
Assuming that the representations and warranties of the Company contained in

 



25   _Article 3_ are true and correct in all material respects and after giving
effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby at the
Closing, including the Financing: (a) the fair saleable value (determined on
a going concern basis) of the assets of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective subsidiaries will be greater than the total
amount of their liabilities (including all liabilities, whether or not
reflected in a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, and whether
direct or indirect, fixed or contingent, secured or unsecured, disputed or
undisputed); (b) Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their
respective subsidiaries will be able to pay their respective debts and
obligations in the ordinary course of business as they mature and become due;
and (c) Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
subsidiaries will have adequate capital and liquidity to carry on their
respective businesses and all businesses in which they are about to engage.

4.10 _Acquisition for Investment_. Parent has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of its participation in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent confirms that (a) the Company has made available to Parent
and Parents Representatives (i) the opportunity to ask questions of the
officers and management employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and
(ii) access to the documents, information and records of the Company and its
subsidiaries, and Parent confirms that it has made an independent
investigation, analysis and evaluation of the Company and its
subsidiaries and their respective properties, assets, business, financial
condition, documents, information and records, and (b) Parent and its
Representatives have reviewed all of the Company SEC Reports and all such
documents, information and records made available to it. Parent is acquiring
the stock of the Surviving Corporation for investment and not with a view
toward or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, or with any
present intention of distributing or selling the stock of the Surviving
Corporation. Parent understands and agrees that the stock of the Surviving
Corporation may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged,
hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration under the
Securities Act, except pursuant to an exemption from such registration
available thereunder, and without compliance with state, local and foreign
securities laws, in each case, to the extent applicable.

 

4.11 _Non-Reliance_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees and acknowledges
that, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in
_Article 3_ , as modified by the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries, or any of their respective stockholders,
trustees, affiliates or Representatives or any other person has made or is
making any other representations or warranties, promises, covenants,
agreements or guaranties, statutory, common law or otherwise, of any nature,
oral or written, past, present or future, including, without limitation, any
other representations or warranties, express or implied, or as to the
accuracy or completeness of any other information, made by, or made available
by, itself or any of its Representatives, with respect to, or in connection
with, the negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure
to the other or the others Representatives of any documentation or other
information with respect to any one or more of the foregoing, including,
without limitation, in certain "data rooms," management presentations or other
information provided or made available to Parent, Merger Sub and their
Representatives in anticipation or contemplation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby (all of which are hereby expressly disclaimed).
Furthermore, in connection with the due diligence investigation of the Company
and its business and operations by and on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub,
Parent, Merger Sub and their

 



26  Representatives have received and may continue to receive from the Company
or its Representatives certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, as well as certain business plan information,
regarding the Company and its business and operations. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub hereby acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking statements, as well as in such business plans, with which each of
Parent and Merger Sub is familiar, that each of Parent and Merger Sub is
taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as such business plans, so furnished to it (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information or business plans), and that each of
Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, or any of their respective stockholders, trustees, affiliates or
Representatives, with respect thereto. Accordingly, each of Parent and Merger
Sub hereby acknowledges that none of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
or any of their respective stockholders, trustees, affiliates or
Representatives, has made or is making any representation or warranty with
respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements
or business plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or
business plans).

5.2 _Financing_.

(a) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall agree to any amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its rights or any rights
in favor of the Company under, any Financing Commitment or any definitive
agreements related to any Financing Commitment, in each case, without the
prior written consent of the Company (including any such amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision
of the Financing Commitments that amends, supplements or otherwise modifies
the conditions precedent to the Financing Commitments), if such amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification of, or waiver of any provision
would reasonably be expected to (x) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing below the amount of cash funded at Closing required to consummate
the Merger and repay or refinance the debt contemplated in this Agreement or
in the Financing Commitments including all fees and expenses related in each
case thereto (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount of the Debt Financing or similar fees) unless the Equity
Financing is increased by a corresponding amount (or, in the case of
additional fees or original issue discount, such Debt Financing permits such
amounts to be funded under a revolving credit facility at Closing) or (y)
impose new or additional conditions or otherwise amend or expand
any conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing that would reasonably be
expected to (1) expand the conditions precedent or contingencies to the
funding at Closing in a manner that would be reasonably likely to make the
funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
the Debt Financing) less likely to occur or prevent or delay the consummation
of the transactions

 



30  contemplated by this Agreement, or (2) adversely impact the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Financing Commitments or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
or the likelihood of consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub may replace
or amend the Debt Financing Letter to add additional lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities, if the representations
set forth in _Section 4.7_ shall be true and correct giving effect to such
replacement or amendment and the addition of such parties, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to (1) prevent or delay or
impair the availability of the financing under the Debt Financing Letter, make
the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions
to obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to occur or prevent or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (2)
adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Financing Commitments or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby). Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Financing Commitments (as such terms may be modified or adjusted in
accordance with the terms of, and within the limits of, the " _flex_ "
provisions contained in the Debt Fee Letter), including (i) using its
commercially reasonable efforts to (w) maintain in effect the
Financing Commitments in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof, (x) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein, (y) satisfy on
a timely basis (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing
Period) all conditions applicable to Parent in such definitive agreements and
(z) consummate the Financing at the Closing, subject to the conditions herein,
and (ii) at the request of the Stockholder Representative or the Company, but
subject to _Section 12.9_, fully enforcing the Limited Guarantors
obligations (and the rights of Parent and the Company) under the Equity
Financing Letters, including by filing one or more lawsuits against the
Limited Guarantors to fully enforce the Limited Guarantors obligations (and
the rights of Parent and the Company) thereunder. Parent shall keep the
Company and the Stockholder Representative informed on a current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to obtain and consummate the
Financing (including by providing draft agreements and being available for
discussion of the status of any such draft agreements, in each case to the
extent requested). Upon any such amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification of the Equity Financing Letters or Debt Financing Letter in
accordance with this _Section 5.2(a)_, the terms " _Equity Financing Letters_
" and " _Debt Financing Letter_ " shall mean the Equity Financing Letters and
Debt Financing Letter, respectively, as so amended, replaced, supplemented or
modified in accordance with this _Section 5.2(a)_.

 

(b) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Financing Commitments (as such terms may
be modified or adjusted in accordance with the terms of, and within the limits
of, the " _flex_ " provisions contained in the Debt Fee Letter) for any
reason, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate and
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable but
in any event no later than the Closing Date, financing from alternative
sources

 



31  (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that in any event (i) are not
subject to any conditions to funding the Financing other than those contained
in the Financing Commitments in effect as of the date hereof, and (ii) do not
contain any additional terms that would reasonably be expected to prevent,
impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including entering into definitive agreements with respect thereto.
In the event that Alternative Financing is arranged in accordance with this
_Section 5.2(b)_, the term "Financing Commitments" shall mean the commitment
letters for such Alternative Financing (as amended, replaced, supplemented or
modified in accordance with _Section 5.2(a)_). In the event that Alternative
Financing shall be obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.2(b)_, the parties
shall comply with the covenants in _Section 5.2(a)_ with respect to such
Alternative Financing _mutatis mutandis_. Parent shall furnish correct and
complete copies of all definitive agreements relating to the Alternative
Financing to the Company and the Stockholder Representative promptly upon
their execution. Parent shall keep the Company and the Stockholder
Representative informed on a current basis in reasonable detail of the status
of its efforts to obtain and consummate the Alternative Financing.

(c) The Company, to the extent Parent and Merger Sub may reasonably request
in connection with the Debt Financing, shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives
to provide cooperation that is reasonably requested by Parent in connection
with the syndication of the Debt Financing, which for purposes of this Section
5.2(c) shall be deemed to include the offering of the Holdco Notes
contemplated in the Debt Financing Letter, including: 

(i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road
shows, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions and sessions with
prospective Financing Sources, investors and ratings agencies, and reasonably
cooperating with the marketing efforts of the Parent and its Financing
Sources, in each case in connection with the Debt Financing; 

(ii) furnishing the Parent and its Financing Sources as promptly as
practicable with financial and other pertinent information regarding the
Company and its subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by the Parent,
including all financial statements and financial and other data of the type
customarily (A) included in a bank information memorandum (including pro
forma financial information) and (B) included in a registered offering of debt
securities by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include financial statements
or information required by Rules 3-09, 3-10 or 3-16 of Regulation S-X or
Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Regulation S-X Item 402(b),
but would include customary disclosure of certain guarantor and non-guarantor
information) and of the type or the type and form that are customarily
included in a private placement of debt securities pursuant to Rule 144A
promulgated under the Securities Act (subject to customary exceptions) (the "
_Required Information_ ") and any other pertinent information regarding the
Company and its subsidiaries as may reasonably be requested in writing by
Parent; _provided_ , that Parent shall be responsible for timely provision of
any post-Closing pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership
or other pro forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into any pro forma
financial information requested

 



32  by Parent to be delivered by the Company (excluding any information that
would customarily be prepared with the cooperation of the Company);

 

(iii) assisting with the preparation of customary materials for rating agency
presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda (including, to the extent necessary, a bank information
memorandum that does not include material non-public information),
prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the
Debt Financing;

(iv) executing and delivering any pledge and security documents and otherwise
reasonably facilitating the granting of a security interest (and perfection
thereof) in collateral, guarantees, mortgages, other definitive financing
documents or other certificates or documents (in each case, subject to the
occurrence of the Closing) as may reasonably be requested by the Parent in
connection with the Debt Financing;

(v) obtaining a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company
with respect to solvency matters in the form attached as Annex I to Exhibit D
to the Debt Financing Letter; _provided_ , that no officer of the Company
shall be required to provide a certification that is not factually accurate,
and customary authorization letters with respect to the bank information
memoranda from a senior officer of the Company and using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain consents of accountants for use of their
reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing;

(vi) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain customary accountants
comfort letters, accountants consents, surveys and title insurance at the
expense of and as reasonably requested by the Parent on behalf of its
Financing Sources;

 

(vii) taking all reasonable actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing,
necessary to permit the consummation of such Debt Financing and to permit the
proceeds thereof to be made available to the Company, including entering into
one or more credit agreements, indentures and/or other instruments on terms
satisfactory to the Parent in connection with the Debt Financing immediately
prior to (and conditioned upon the occurrence of) the Effective Time to the
extent direct borrowings or debt incurrence by the Company is contemplated in
the Financing Commitment at the Effective Time; and

 

(viii) at least three (3) days prior to the Closing, providing all reasonably
available documentation and other reasonably available information about the
Company and each of its subsidiaries as is reasonably requested in writing by
the Debt Financing Sources at least five (5) days prior to the Closing to the
extent required under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act in order to
satisfy the conditions set forth in paragraph 10 of the Debt Financing Letter.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (x) neither the
Company nor any of the Companys subsidiaries shall (1) be required to pay any
commitment or other similar fee, (2) have any liability or obligation under
any loan agreement or any related document or any other

 



33  agreement or document related to the Debt Financing (or Alternative
Financing) unless and until the Closing occurs, or (3) incur any other
liability in connection with the Financing (or any Alternative Financing)
unless and until the Closing occurs, and (y) no person that is a director or
officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be required to take
any action in such capacity that would result in personal liability with
respect to the Financing prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, it is understood and agreed that the condition precedent set
forth in Section 8.2(b), as applied to the Companys obligations under
this Section 5.2(c), shall be deemed to be satisfied unless the financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Letter has not been obtained as a direct
result of the Companys failure to undertake commercially reasonable efforts
with respect to its obligations under this Section 5.2(c), taken as a whole.

(d) Parent shall give the Company and the Stockholder Representative prompt
written notice of (i) any material breach by any party of any term or
condition of the Financing Commitments (or commitments for any Alternative
Financing obtained in accordance with this _Section 5.2_) of which Parent,
the Stockholder Representative or the Company becomes aware, (ii) any
termination of the Financing Commitments (or commitments for any Alternative
Financing obtained in accordance with this _Section 5.2_) or (iii)
any condition precedent of the Financing (or any Alternative Financing
obtained in accordance with this _Section 5.2_), which Parent, the
Stockholder Representative or the Company has any reason to believe will not
be satisfied at the Closing Date.

5.3 _Treatment of Existing Indebtedness_. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent in obtaining, at Parents
expense, as soon as possible after the date of this Agreement, a fully
executed copy of an amendment or waiver of that certain Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement, dated February 10, 2011 (as amended from time to time, the
" _Credit Agreement_ "), among the Company, Trans Union LLC, the guarantors
party thereto, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as administrative and
collateral agent, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as L/C issuer and
swing line lender, the other lenders party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as
syndication agent, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and SunTrust Bank as TL

Smith and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint
bookrunners, which amends or waives the "change of control" provisions set
forth therein to permit the transactions contemplated hereby, such amendment
or waiver to be effective at or prior to the Effective Time (it being
understood and agreed that such amendment and waiver may include such other
terms as Parent and the requisite lenders under such credit agreement shall
agree so long as such amendments and waivers (other than the "Change of
Control" waiver or amendment) shall not become effective prior to the
Effective Time). To the extent the foregoing amendment or waiver is not
obtained on or prior to the date that is fifteen (15) days after the date
hereof, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to, and to
cause its subsidiaries to, negotiate a payoff letter from the agent under the
Credit Agreement, in customary form, and which payoff

 



34  letter shall (i) indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully
satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage
costs or similar obligations related to the Credit Agreement as of the
Closing Date (the " _Debt Payoff Amount_ "), and (ii) state that all Liens in
connection therewith relating to the assets of the Company or its subsidiaries
shall be, upon the payment of the Debt Payoff Amount on the Closing Date,
released (the payoff letter described in this sentence being referred to as
the " _Payoff Letter_ "). The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to, and to cause its subsidiaries to, deliver all notices and take
all other actions reasonably requested by Parent and Merger Sub to facilitate
the termination of any commitments under the Credit Agreement, the repayment
in full of all obligations then outstanding thereunder (using funds provided
by Parent) and the release of all Liens in connection therewith on the Closing
Date or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter (such termination,
repayment and release, the " _Credit Agreement Termination_ ");
provided, that in no event shall this _Section 5.3_ require the Company or
any of its subsidiaries to cause such Credit Agreement Termination unless the
Closing shall have occurred and Parent shall have provided to the Company
funds to repay in full all obligations under the Credit Agreement.
Concurrently with the Closing, Parent shall pay to the agent under the Company
Credit Agreement all amounts required pursuant to the terms of the Credit
Agreement and specified in the Payoff Letter to effect the Credit Agreement
Termination.

5.4 _Senior Notes_.

 

(a) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to commence, as
promptly as practicable on or after the date hereof and following receipt of
written instructions from Parent, a consent solicitation with respect to a
modification of the definition of " _Investors_ " in the Indenture, dated June
15, 2010 (the " _Indenture_ "), among Trans Union LLC (" _Trans Union LLC_
"), TransUnion Financing Corporation (together with Trans Union LLC, the "
_Issuers_ "), the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as trustee, governing the 11 3/8% Senior Notes due 2018
(the " _Senior Notes_ ") of the Issuers, the primary effect of which will be
that the Trans Union LLC shall not be required to offer to purchase the Senior
Notes after consummation of the Merger (or as may otherwise be reasonably
determined by Parent for the purpose of facilitating the transactions
contemplated hereby), and upon termination of such consent solicitation, upon
receipt of written instructions from Parent, such other consent solicitation
relating to the Senior Notes reasonably requested by Parent for the purpose of
facilitating the transactions contemplated hereby (each, a " _Consent
Solicitation_ "). Any Consent Solicitation will contain such customary terms
and conditions as are reasonably determined by Parent; _provided_ that (i)
this Agreement shall have not been terminated in accordance with _Section
10.1_ and (ii) either the Company shall have received from Parent all
necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with the Consent
Solicitation, including the consent solicitation statement, consent forms and
other related documents (collectively, the " _Solicitation Documents_ "),
which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company,
or, at Parents request, the Company shall prepare, or cause to be prepared,
such Solicitation Documents, as described in  _Section 5.4(c)_ below. The
Company shall waive any of the conditions relating to any Consent
Solicitation, as applicable, as may be reasonably requested by Parent in
writing and shall not, without the written consent of Parent, waive
any condition to any Consent Solicitation or make any changes to any Consent
Solicitation other than as agreed between Parent and the Company. The Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly make any change to
the terms and conditions of any Consent Solicitation reasonably requested by
Parent.

 



35 Notwithstanding the foregoing, any proposed amendments to the Indenture
contemplated by the Consent Solicitation shall revert to the form in effect
prior to the effectiveness of any proposed amendments and be of no further
effect if the Closing does not occur.

(b) The Company agrees that, promptly following any consent expiration date,
assuming the requisite consents are received and conditions set forth in the
Indenture have been satisfied, the Company shall cause each of its
subsidiaries that is party to the Indenture as is necessary to execute a
supplemental indenture to the Indenture, which supplemental indenture shall
implement the amendments set forth in the Solicitation Documents and shall
become operative upon the Effective Time. Concurrent with the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Company to pay for consents validly delivered and not
revoked in accordance with the Consent Solicitation, it being understood that
all such payments shall be subject to the reimbursement provisions of
_Section 5.5_ if such payments are made.

(c) Promptly after the date of this Agreement and subject to the
reimbursement provisions of _Section 5.5_, Parent shall prepare, or shall
request the Company to prepare, the Solicitation Documents. Parent and the
Company shall, and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to, reasonably
cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Solicitation Documents and
other customary documentation. Any Solicitation Documents (including all
amendments or supplements thereto) and all mailings to the holders of the
Senior Notes in connection with any Consent Solicitation shall be subject to
the prior review of, and comment by, the Company and Parent and shall be
reasonably acceptable in form and substance to each of them. If at any time
prior to the completion of a Consent Solicitation any information in the
Solicitation Documents should be discovered by the Company and its
subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other, which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Solicitation Documents, as
applicable, so that they shall not contain any untrue statements of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party in writing, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
disseminated by or on behalf of the Company to the holders of the Senior
Notes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.4_ , the
Company shall comply with any Applicable Law in connection with a Consent
Solicitation. To the extent that the provisions of any Applicable Law
conflict with this _Section 5.4_ , the Company shall comply with the
Applicable Law and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations
hereunder by such compliance.

 

(d) In connection with any Consent Solicitation, Parent may select one or more
solicitation agents, information agents and other agents to provide
assistance in connection therewith and the Company shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries to, enter into usual and customary agreements (including usual
and customary indemnities) with such parties so selected and on terms and
conditions reasonably acceptable to Parent. Parent shall provide, or cause to
be provided, the requisite amount of funds to the Company for all payments to
holders of Senior Notes in respect of any consents validly delivered and not
revoked in accordance with the Consent Solicitation.

 



36 (e) Following the Closing, if requisite consents in the Consent Solicitation
have not been obtained and a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture)
has occurred, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) comply with the requirements under the Indenture
relating to an offer to purchase or redeem the outstanding Senior Notes as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is expressly agreed
by the parties hereto that the failure to obtain the consent of the holders of
the Senior Notes in connection with any Consent Solicitation shall not be
deemed to be a breach by the Company under this Agreement so long as the
Company has complied with its obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.4_.

(g) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to commence, as
promptly as practicable following receipt of written instructions from Parent,
one or more offers to purchase the Senior Notes (an " _Offer_ "). At the
election of Parent, the Offer will (i) comply with the provisions of Section
4.14 of the Indenture and/or (ii) contain such customary terms and conditions
as are reasonably determined by Parent;  _provided_ that (i) this Agreement
shall have not been terminated in accordance with _Section 10.1_ and (ii)
either the Company shall have received from Parent all necessary and
appropriate documentation in connection with the Offer, including an offer to
purchase or change of control notice, as applicable, letters of transmittal
and other related documents (collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ "), which
shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, or, at
Parents request, the Company shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, such
Offer Documents. Subject to the terms of Section 4.14 of the Indenture, if
applicable, the Offer shall be conducted in accordance with this _Section
5.4_, _mutatis mutandis_ , and shall comply in all respects with Applicable
Law. The consummation of any Offer shall be subject to the occurrence of the
Closing. Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, the requisite amount
of funds to the Company for all payments to holders of Senior Notes in respect
of any Notes purchased.

5.5 _Limitations, Indemnity and Reimbursement_.

(a) Nothing in this Article V shall require the Company to take any action to
the extent it would, in the Companys reasonable judgment, (i) unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of the Company or its subsidiaries
taken as a whole or (ii) be reasonably likely to result in the waiver of any
attorney-client privilege (the reasonable likelihood of such disclosure
resulting in the waiver of attorney-client privilege having been determined in
consultation with outside legal counsel) or the unauthorized disclosure of
any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of their obligations with
respect to confidentiality.

(b) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholders, the Stockholder
Representative, the Company and its subsidiaries, and their respective
officers, employees and other representatives, from and against any and all
Losses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with (i) the
arrangement of the Financing and the utilization of any information in
connection therewith, (ii) the amendment or waiver to the Credit Agreement or
the Credit Agreement Termination or (iii) any Consent Solicitation and the
Solicitation Documents; provided, however, that for purposes of this clause
(iii), Parent shall not have any obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any
such party or person to the extent that any such

 



37  Losses suffered or incurred arise from disclosure regarding the Company and
its subsidiaries supplied in writing by such party or person for inclusion in
the Solicitation Documents or included in any Company SEC Report that is
incorporated by reference in the Solicitation Documents that is determined to
have contained a material misstatement or omission.

(c) Parent shall reimburse the Company for any and all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company and its subsidiaries in
connection with its compliance with  _Section 5.2(c)_, _Section 5.3_ and
_Section 5.4_ (including reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel and the
fees and expenses of any solicitation agent, information agent, dealer manager
or other agent retained pursuant to the Companys obligations hereunder)
promptly following incurrence and upon receipt of the Companys written
request therefor.

6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, upon reasonable prior written notice and subject to
Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information (it being agreed that

and shall cause each of the Companys subsidiaries to, afford to the
Representatives of Parent and Merger Sub, during normal business hours and in

likely to result in the waiver of any attorney-client privilege (the
reasonable likelihood of any such disclosure resulting in the waiver of
attorney-client privilege having been determined in consultation with outside
legal counsel) or the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties if the
Company or its subsidiary, as the case may be, shall have used commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such

of its Representatives present at all times during any such reviews,

ordinary course of business of Parent or Merger Sub regarding the business,
operations or prospects of the Company or regarding this Agreement or the

the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) each of
Parent and Merger Sub agree to be bound by and comply with the provisions set
forth in the Confidentiality Agreement as if such provisions were set forth
herein, and such provisions are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

 



39 (c) Except as otherwise set forth in _Section 7.3_, subject to entering into
a confidentiality agreement with the Company that is reasonably acceptable to
the Company and such Stockholders from and after the Closing, in connection
with any reasonable business purpose relating to the Stockholders ownership
of the capital stock of the Company or their, or any of their affiliates,
status as a current or former officer, manager or stockholder of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries (including preparation of governmental or
regulatory reporting obligations, or the resolution of any claims made
against or incurred by the Stockholders in respect of periods prior to the
Closing), for a period of six (6) years (or such longer period as may be
required by Applicable Laws) after the Closing, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to (i) retain the books and records
relating to the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries with respect to
periods prior to the Closing in a manner reasonably consistent with the
prior practice of the Company and its subsidiaries, and (ii) upon reasonable
advance notice and subject to Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information (it being agreed that Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its subsidiaries to make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which such laws apply), Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause each of the Surviving
Corporations subsidiaries to, afford to the Stockholders and their
respective Representatives and the Stockholder Representative, during normal
business hours and in manner so as not to interfere with the normal operation

prepared or used in connection with the preparation of the Financial
Statements.

6.5 _Consents; Further Assurances_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company, on
the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall, and shall
cause their respective subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best
efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or
advisable to comply promptly with (and, as necessary, to vacate any restraints
or prohibitions under) all Applicable Laws and other legal requirements that

the transactions contemplated hereby and, subject to the conditions set forth
in _Article 8_ hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as

respective subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, and to comply with the terms and conditions of any such consent,
authorization, order or approval; _provided_ that the parties hereto
understand and agree that the reasonable best efforts of any party hereto
shall not be deemed to include (and in no event shall any party be deemed to

entering into any settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or
agreement with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, or (ii) divesting or otherwise holding separate
(including by establishing a trust or otherwise), or taking any other action
(or otherwise agreeing to do any of the foregoing) with respect to any of its
or the Companys subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates
businesses, assets or properties.

 

(b) Without limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, undertakes and agrees to file
as soon as practicable, but in all cases, within ten (10) Business Days
following the date hereof (except that the requirement to make such filings
within ten (10) Business Days shall not apply to (a) any filing with the
European Commission (other than the Form CO, which the parties agree to file
with the European Commission in draft form within the ten (10) Business Day
period) or (b) any required notification to the antitrust authorities
in Brazil, which shall instead be filed within the statutory deadline of
fifteen (15) Business Days following the date hereof), (i) a Notification and
Report Form under the HSR Act with the United States Federal Trade Commission
(the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ "), and (ii) such other filings with any
other Governmental Entities as may be required under any applicable foreign
antitrust, competition or trade regulation law, as set forth in _Schedule
6.5_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, as applicable, shall (x)
respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries or requests for
additional information or documentation received from the FTC, the Antitrust
Division or any other Governmental Entity, and (y) not extend any waiting
period under the HSR Act or any foreign antitrust, competition or trade
regulation law or enter into any agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust
Division or any other Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto. Subject to the provision set forth in _Section
6.5(a)_, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall offer to take (and if such offer
is accepted, commit to take) all steps which it is capable of taking to avoid
or eliminate impediments under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation
law or that may be asserted by the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement so as to enable the Closing to occur prior to the Outside Date.

 

(c) Each party shall promptly furnish to the other and the Stockholder
Representative copies of any notices or written communications received by
Parent or any of its affiliates from any third party or any Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
such party shall permit counsel to the other party and the Stockholder
Representative an opportunity to review in advance, and such party shall
consider in good faith the views of such counsel in connection with, any
proposed written communications by such party and/or its affiliates to any
third party or any Governmental Entity, including the FTC and Antitrust
Division, concerning the transactions contemplated by

 



41  this Agreement. Each party agrees to provide the other party, the
Stockholder Representative and their counsel the opportunity, on reasonable
advance notice, to participate in any substantive meetings or discussions,
either in person or by telephone, between such party and/or any of its
affiliates, agents or advisors, on the one hand, and any third party or
Governmental Entity, including the FTC and Antitrust Division, on the other
hand, concerning or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) In no event shall the Company or any of its subsidiaries be obligated to
bear any expense or pay any fee or grant any concession in connection with
obtaining any consents, authorizations or approvals required in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, to the extent that any such expenses are paid by the Company
or any of its subsidiaries, none of such amounts shall be Transaction
Expenses.

6.6 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) Parent agrees that for a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending
on December 13, 2013 (the " _Benefit Protection Period_ "), it shall provide,
or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, compensation and benefits
(other than equity-based compensation) to each individual who is employed by
the Company or any of its subsidiaries as of the Closing (each, a " _Company
Employee_ ") under the Company Benefit Plans or other employee benefit plans
or compensation arrangements of Parent or any affiliate of Parent that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits
(other than equity-based compensation) provided to such Company Employee under
the Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that, after December 31, 2012, such compensation and benefits
shall be subject to review and reasonable adjustment by the Board of Directors
of the Surviving Corporation following consultation with, and after due
consideration of input from, the Chief Executive Officer of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) Without limiting the generality of  _Section 6.6(a)_, from and after the
Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and continue
without amendment during the Benefit Protection Period or, if sooner, until
all obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all of the Companys
employment, severance, retention and termination plans, policies, programs,
agreements and arrangements (including any change in control or severance
agreement between the Company and any Company Employee), in each case, as in
effect on the Closing, including with respect to any payments, benefits or
rights arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(either alone or in combination with any other event), without any amendment
or modification, other than any amendment or modification required to comply
with Applicable Law or as consented to by the parties thereto.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.6(a)_, the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries shall be permitted to make payments to
Company Employees pursuant to annual cash incentive plans with respect to the
annual performance period in which the Closing occurs upon the terms and
conditions of such plans as in effect on the date hereof.

 

(d) With respect to any "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, maintained by Parent or its affiliates, including the Surviving
Corporation (including

 



42  any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans) for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accruals (other than accruals
under any defined benefit pension plans) each Company Employees service with
the Company or any of the Companys subsidiaries (as well as service with any
predecessor employer of the Company or any of the Companys subsidiaries, to
the extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company
or such Company Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent and its
affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however,_ that
such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits.

(e) Parent shall, or shall cause its affiliates, including the Surviving
Corporation, to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
affiliates in which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be
eligible to participate from and after the Closing, except to the extent that
such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived
under the comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing.
Parent shall, or shall cause its affiliates, including the Surviving
Corporation, to recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of
all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Closing occurs for purposes of satisfying such years deductible
and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which
such Company Employee (and dependents) will be eligible to participate from
and after the Closing.

(f) To the extent that (1) any Covered Person would be entitled to any payment
or benefit in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (2) such payment or benefit would potentially constitute a "parachute
payment" under Section 280G of the Code, the Company shall, prior to Closing:

(i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a binding written waiver
by such Covered Person of any such portion of such parachute payment as
exceeds 2.99 times of such Covered Persons "base amount" within the meaning
of Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code (collectively, the " _Excess Parachute
Payments_ ") to the extent such excess is not subsequently approved pursuant
to a Stockholder vote in accordance with the requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code (the " _280G Stockholder Approval Requirements_ ");

(ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Stockholder approval
that satisfies the 280G Stockholder Approval Requirements in respect of the
Excess Parachute Payments payable to all such Covered Persons;

(iii) provide to the Stockholders all required disclosure under Section
280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such disclosure before it is distributed
to the Stockholders; and

 



43 (iv) hold a vote of the Stockholders in a manner that is intended to
satisfy the 280G Stockholder Approval Requirements.

(g) Without limiting the generality of the second sentence of  _Section
12.6_, nothing in this _Section 6.6_, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other person, including any Company Employee, any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 6.6_ shall constitute an
amendment of, or an undertaking to amend, any Company Benefit Plan or any
employee benefit plan or compensation arrangement of Parent or any affiliate
of Parent. Nothing herein shall create any obligation on the part of Parent
or the Company or any of its subsidiaries to continue to employ any Company
Employee for any definite period of time following the Closing.

 

6.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

(a) The provisions of the constituent documents of the Company and its
subsidiaries concerning the elimination of liability and indemnification of
directors and/or other persons shall not be amended in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any person that is as of the date
hereof or the Effective Time covered as an indemnitee under any such
elimination of liability or indemnification provisions. In addition to
the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time for a period of six (6)
years, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless (or caused to be indemnified and
held harmless), to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, each
person who is, or at the Closing Date will be, a current or former director,
employee, agent or officer of the Company (the " _D andO Indemnitees_") against
all Losses arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions (or alleged acts
or omissions) of the DandO Indemnitees, or any of them, in their capacities as
such on or prior to Closing. To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable
Law, the indemnification and related rights hereunder shall be mandatory
rather than permissive, and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) promptly advance expenses in connection
with such indemnification to the extent permitted under Applicable Law.

(b) Effective upon the Closing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and each
of their respective affiliates, Representatives, successors and assigns
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the stockholders of the
Company immediately prior to the Closing) (collectively, the " _Releasing
Parties_ "), shall be deemed to have remised, released and forever discharged
the individuals set forth on _Schedule 6.7(b)_ (collectively, the " _Released
Parties_ ") of and from any and all claims which the Releasing Parties, or any
of them, now have, ever had, or at the Closing may have, or hereafter can,
shall or may have, against the Released Parties, or any of them, for, upon or
by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever, from the beginning of time
through the Closing Date (the " _Released Claims_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that no such release is granted to any Released Party for an intentional and
knowing material violation of Applicable Law by such Released Party, or an
intentional and knowing material breach by such Released Party of a Company
policy. As of the Closing Date, Parent, on behalf of each of the Releasing
Parties, expressly acknowledges that it has had, or has had and waived, the
opportunity to be advised by independent legal counsel.

 



44 (c) As of the Closing Date, Parent, on behalf of each of the Releasing
Parties, expressly acknowledges that it has had, or has had and waived, the
opportunity to be advised by independent legal counsel and hereby waives and
relinquishes all rights and benefits afforded by Section 1542 of the
California Civil Code (and any analogous law of any other state, locality, or
other jurisdiction) with respect to the Released Claims and does so
understanding and acknowledging the significance and consequence of such
specific waiver of Section 1542 which provides:

 

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

 

(d) Parent, on behalf of each of the Releasing Parties, hereby represents,
warrants and covenants to each Released Party that there has not been and
will not be any assignment or other transfer of any right or interest in any
claims that any Releasing Party ever had, has or may have against the Released
Parties, and hereby agrees to indemnify and hold each Released Party
harmless from any claims and Losses directly or indirectly incurred by any of
the Released Parties as a result of any person asserting any right or interest
pursuant to any such purported assignment or transfer of any such right or
interest.

 

(e) Parent, on behalf of each of the Releasing Parties, hereby agrees that if
any Releasing Party hereafter commences, joins in or in any manner seeks
relief through any suit arising out of, based upon or relating to any of the
claims released hereunder, or in any manner asserts against any Released Party
any of the claims released hereunder, then such Releasing Parties will pay
to such Released Party, in addition to any other Losses, direct or indirect,
all attorneys fees incurred in defending or otherwise responding to such suit
or claims.

(f) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to and the Surviving Corporation shall cause its subsidiaries to) procure and
maintain in effect with respect to all periods prior to the Closing Date,
directors and officers liability insurance covering those present and former
officers and directors of the Company and those present and former officers,
directors and managers of the subsidiaries who are currently covered by
directors and officers liability insurance policies on terms no less
favorable in the aggregate than the terms of such current insurance coverage
with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading
statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed
against a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries by
reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or
prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) if any claim is asserted or made within such six-year period, such
insurance shall be continued in respect of such claim until the final
disposition thereof, (ii) in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence
an annual premium amount in excess of 250% of the current annual premium,
which amount is set forth in _Schedule 6.7(f)_ and (iii) if the aggregate
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to

 



45  obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such
amount.

 

(g) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each person released or entitled to
indemnification, or other benefit hereunder, and each such persons heirs,
representatives, successors or assigns, it being expressly agreed that such
persons shall be third party beneficiaries of this  _Section 6.7_, and (ii)
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other right to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or
otherwise. The Surviving Corporation shall not (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation not to) (x) amend the provisions of this _Section 6.7_
in a manner that would adversely affect any such third party beneficiary
without the prior written consent of such third party beneficiary, or (y)
following the Closing, enter into, or permit any of its affiliates to enter
into, any merger, consolidation or other transaction unless Parent shall have
ensured that the surviving or resulting entity will assume the obligations
imposed by this _Section 6.7_. With respect to any claim by a third party
beneficiary under this _Section 6.7_, no Releasing Party may assert by way of
defense, set-off or counterclaim, any claim against, or Losses owing by,
the Stockholders or another third party beneficiary.

(h) The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to), from time to time following the Closing, execute
and deliver such other documents and instruments and take such other actions
as may be reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative or any
Released Party or DandO Indemnitee to implement the provisions of this _Section
6.7_.

6.8 _Intercompany Accounts_. All intercompany accounts between the Company or
its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Stockholders or their affiliates,
on the other hand, as of the Closing shall be settled (irrespective of the
terms of payment of such intercompany accounts) in the manner provided in
this _Section 6.8,_ other than, in each case, any such intercompany accounts
with portfolio companies or similarly-held investments of the Stockholders and
their affiliates that constitute ordinary course business dealings with the
Company or its subsidiaries. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent a statement setting
out in reasonable detail the calculation of all such intercompany account
balances based upon the latest available financial information as of such
date and, to the extent requested by Parent, provide Parent with supporting
documentation to verify the underlying intercompany charges and transactions.
All such intercompany account balances shall be paid in full in cash prior to
the Closing (and, to the extent that any such amounts owed by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries to any Stockholder or any affiliate thereof are not
paid on or prior to Closing, all such unpaid amounts shall be deemed
cancelled effective as of the Closing). In addition, all other Contracts
between or among any Stockholder or any of their respective affiliates, on the
one hand, and the Company or any of its subsidiaries, on the other
hand, shall be hereby deemed terminated as of the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding any provision in this _Section 6.8_ to the contrary, this
_Section 6.8_ shall not apply to accounts or Contracts arising in the
ordinary course of the Companys or the counterpartys business as a result
of any arms length customer, user, supplier or similar relationship.

6.9 _No Solicitation; Other Offers_. After the execution and delivery of the
Written Consent by the Required Holders to the Company, neither the Company
nor any of its

 



46  subsidiaries shall, nor shall the Company or any of its subsidiaries
authorize or permit any of its or their officers or representatives to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take any action to
facilitate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any
information relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in any way with, or
knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any
third party that is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement
with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or (iv) enter into any agreement, letter or intent, memorandum
or understanding or term sheet with respect to an Acquisition Proposal.

6.10  _Closing Cash_. The Company agrees that, as of the Closing, Closing
Cash shall be greater than or equal to $15,000,000.

 

ARTICLE 7

TAX MATTERS

7.1 _Filing of Tax Returns_.

(a) Parent shall prepare or cause the Company to prepare, in a manner
consistent with past practices (except as required by Applicable Law), and
file or cause the Company to file, all Tax Returns for the Company and its
subsidiaries which are required to be filed after the Closing Date. Parent and
the Company shall deliver substantially final drafts of such Tax Returns
described in the preceding sentence that cover Pre-Closing Tax
Periods (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Straddle Period) to the
Stockholder Representative at least fourteen (14) days prior to filing such
Tax Returns to permit the Stockholder Representative to review and comment on
each such Tax Return. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
Parent, the Company and the Stockholder Representative agree that the
Transaction Tax Deductions shall be taken into account as losses or deductions
in Pre-Closing Tax Periods, and Parent and the Company agree to prepare the
Tax Returns described in this _Section 7.1(a)_ in a manner consistent with
such intent.

(b) The Specified Tax Refund shall be for the account of the PFBI
Stockholders. If the Specified Tax Refund (or portion thereof) is received
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall be permitted to pay such amount
to the PFBI Stockholders, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement. If the Specified Tax Refund (or portion thereof) is received on or
after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay
the net amount of such refund to the Stockholder Representative for
distribution to each PFBI Stockholder in amounts equal to such PFBI
Stockholders proportionate share of such refund within fifteen (15) Business
Days of the receipt thereof. Any payment of the Specified Tax Refund (or
portion thereof) made pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall be made net of
(i) any costs associated with obtaining such refund, (ii) any Tax required to
be withheld on such payment, and (iii) any Taxes imposed on the Company or
its subsidiaries as a result of such refund. The amount or economic benefit of
any other Tax refunds, credits, or reduction in assessed Taxes of the Company
or its subsidiaries arising out of or related to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be for the account of Parent.

 



47 7.2 _Straddle Periods_. In the case of a Straddle Period, the amount of any
Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of the Company and its
subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(to the extent reasonably practicable taking into account the Companys
accounting systems, and for such purpose, the taxable period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such
time), and the amount of other Taxes of the Company and its subsidiaries for a
Straddle Period which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to
be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in such Straddle Period.

 

7.3 _Cooperation_. Parent, the Company and its subsidiaries and the
Stockholder Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to _Section 7.1_ and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes (including any Tax Claim). Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the others request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to execute Tax Returns and to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Parent, Company and its
subsidiaries, and the Stockholder Representative agree (a) to retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its
subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by Parent or the Stockholders, any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority, (b) to give the
other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying
or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests,
Parent, Company and its subsidiaries or the Stockholder Representative, as the
case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and
records, and (c) to notify the other party in writing within fifteen (15)
days of receipt from any Governmental Entity of notice of any audit, inquiry,
examination, demand or proceeding which may affect such other party.

 

7.4 _Certain Taxes and Fees_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be borne equally by Parent and the Stockholders. Parent
will file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to
all such Taxes, fees and charges, and, if required by Applicable Law,
Stockholders will, and will cause its affiliates to, join in the execution of
any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The costs and expenses
associated with the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns and other
documentation shall be borne equally by Parent and the Stockholders.

 

7.5 _Tax Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Closing, each Stockholder hereby indemnifies Parent and
Merger Sub and their respective officers, directors, agents, employees,
successors and 

 



48  assigns (collectively, the " _Parent Tax Indemnitees_ ") against and agrees
to hold each Parent Tax Indemnitee harmless from any Covered Tax and any
liabilities, costs, expenses (including, reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of
investigation and attorneys fees and expenses), losses, damages, assessments,
settlements or judgments arising out of or incident to the imposition,
assessment or assertion of any Covered Tax (together, a " _Tax Loss_ ").
Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 7.5_, (i) in no event shall
the amount to be paid by the MDP Stockholder to the Parent Tax Indemnitees in
respect of a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ exceed
the MDP Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of such claim, and (ii) in no event
shall the aggregate amount to be paid by the Other Stockholders to the Parent
Tax Indemnitees in respect of a claim for indemnification pursuant to this
_Section 7.5_ exceed the Other Stockholders aggregate Pro Rata Portion of
such claim. The obligations of the Stockholders under this _Section 7.5_
shall survive until the Second Anniversary Date, after which time no claim
for indemnification not theretofore asserted may be brought in respect of any
Tax Loss.

(b) If the Company or any of its subsidiaries is required by Applicable Law to
pay an amount to a Taxing Authority that would constitute a Tax Loss in
connection with but prior to the resolution of a suit, action or proceeding
described in _Section 7.6_, (i) the MDP Stockholder shall pay its Pro Rata
Portion of such amount and (ii) the Stockholder Representative shall cause the
Indemnity Escrow Agent to release the Other Stockholders aggregate Pro Rata
Portion of such amount, in each case, to Parent within ten (10) days of
receipt of notice of the payment by Parent. In the event that Parent receives
a partial or total refund of any such payment, Parent shall transfer the
appropriate amounts to the Stockholder Representative and to the MDP
Stockholder within ten (10) days of receipt.

(c) Any claim of any Parent Tax Indemnitee under this _Section 7.5_ may be
made and enforced by Parent on behalf of such Parent Tax Indemnitee.

 

(d) Any payment to the Parent Tax Indemnitees in respect of any claim for
indemnification properly asserted by the Parent Tax Indemnitees under this
_Section 7.5_ shall be paid in the manner provided in _Section 9.6_.

7.6 _Contest of Tax Claims_.

(a) If an audit, examination, inquiry or other claim shall be made by any
Governmental Entity, which could result in the Stockholders having any
liability under _Section 7.5_ (a " _Tax Claim_ "), Parent shall notify the
Stockholder Representative promptly of such Tax Claim in writing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
obligation of the Stockholders hereunder, except to the extent the
Stockholders have actually been prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(b) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Parent
shall control all proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection
with such Tax Claim, including all decisions to grant or deny any waiver or
extension of the applicable statute of limitations or to settle or compromise
such Tax Claim, provided that (i) the Stockholder Representative may, at its
election and own expense, advise and consult with Parent in connection with,
and participate in the conduct of, such Tax Claim and (ii) Parent

 



49  shall not settle, resolve or close any Tax Claim without the written consent
of the Stockholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent
shall (A) provide the Stockholder Representative with copies of all
correspondence, notice or other written materials received from any
Governmental Entities, (B) keep the Stockholder Representative and its tax
advisors advised of significant developments in the Tax Claim and of
significant communications involving representatives of the Governmental
Entities, (C) seek input from the Stockholder Representative prior to making
any material submission (including responses to material information document
requests) to any Governmental Entities, (D) execute appropriate powers of
attorney in favor of the Stockholder Representative and its agents, and (E) at
the request and expense of the Stockholder Representative, reasonably file
protests or otherwise reasonably contest any proposed or asserted Tax
deficiencies, including filing petitions for redetermination or prosecuting
actions for refund in any court, and pursuing the appeal of any such actions.

(c) In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this  _Section
7.6_ and any other section of this Agreement, this _Section 7.6_ shall
control.

7.7 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Other than the Tax Separation Agreement, dated
as of January 1, 2005, by and among the Company, Marmon Holdings, Inc. and
each of their respective direct and indirect subsidiaries (which shall
continue in effect following the Closing), all Tax sharing and similar
agreements with respect to or involving the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any affiliate of the Stockholders (other
than the Company or any of its subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date (other than (a) tax indemnification
agreements entered into in connection with sales of assets or businesses, and
(b) agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business, the primary
subject matter of which is not Tax) and neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries shall thereafter be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder.

7.8 _Amended Returns_. Parent, the Company and its subsidiaries shall not
amend, refile or otherwise modify any income or other material Tax Return with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of
the Stockholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. For purposes of this _Section 7.8_, Stockholder Representatives
consent shall not be deemed to be unreasonably withheld if such amendment,
filing, or modification results in Tax liability to the Stockholders.

7.9 _Parent Actions_. Except to the extent required by Applicable Law or
pursuant to the consent of the Stockholder Representative, in no event shall
the Stockholders be liable for any Tax Loss to the extent caused by or
increased as a result of elections made or actions taken by Parent, any of
its affiliates, the Company, or any of its subsidiaries after the Closing,
including elections pursuant to Section 338 of the Code or Treasury Regulation
Section 301.7701-3, or with respect to changes in any accounting policy, any
tax reporting position or the length of any accounting period for Tax
purposes.

ARTICLE 9

INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 _Survival_. The representations and warranties of the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall survive the Closing
until the first anniversary of the Closing (the " _First Anniversary Date_ "),

_3.3_ , _3.4_ , _3.9_ , _3.16(e)(ii)_ , _3.18_ , _4.1_ , _4.2_ , _4.3(a)_ and

warranties for which such survival periods have expired. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentences, any breach of representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this
Agreement shall survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate
pursuant to the preceding sentences, if written notice of the inaccuracy or
breach thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity shall have been given in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement to the party against whom
such indemnity may be sought prior to such time.

9.2 _Indemnification of Parent Indemnitees_. From and after the Closing, and

this _Article 9_ , Parent and Merger Sub and their respective officers,
directors, agents, employees, successors and assigns (collectively, the "

against any liability, obligations,

 



53  fines, penalties, losses, settlements, damages, claims, interest, awards and
judgments, costs, Taxes and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
other reasonable costs and expenses of investigating or contesting any of the
foregoing) and any diminution in value (collectively, " _Loss_ " or " _Losses_
") suffered or incurred by any of them as a result of, or arising out of:

 

(a) any untruths, inaccuracies or breaches of any representations or
warranties of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except for the
representations and warranties in _Sections 3.6_ , _3.7_ , _3.19(e)_ , _3.21_
and _3.25(a)_ , the first sentence of each of _Sections 3.19(a)_ and _3.22_ ,
and with respect to the definition of, and reference to, any Material
Contracts, such untruths, inaccuracies or breaches shall be determined without
regard to any qualification or exception contained in such representation or
warranty relating to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect or any
similar qualification or standard; _provided_ , _further_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing proviso, no Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled
to indemnification under this _Section 9.2(a)_ in respect of any
Losses resulting from or arising out of any untruths, inaccuracies or
breaches of any representations or warranties under _Section 3.8_, to the
extent that (i) such claim relates to the matters that are the subject of the
representations or warranties under _Section 3.6_ (Company SEC Reports
complying with federal securities laws) or _3.7_ (Financial Statements having
been prepared in accordance with GAAP; for the avoidance of doubt, the subject
matter of this representation is not non-GAAP liabilities) and (ii) such
Parent Indemnitee would not otherwise be entitled to indemnification under
this _Section 9.2(a)_ with respect to such _Section 3.6_ or _3.7_ ;

 

(b) any breach of any agreement or covenant of the Company contained in this
Agreement;

 

(c) Transaction Expenses exceeding $21,600,000 (in which event, for the
avoidance of doubt, the amount of Losses indemnifiable under this  _Section
9.2(c)_ shall equal the amount of such excess); or

(d) the amount of Closing Cash being less than $15,000,000 (in which event,
for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of Losses indemnifiable under this
_Section 9.2(d)_ shall equal the amount of such shortfall);

regardless, in any case, of whether such Losses arise as a result of the
negligence, strict liability or any liability under any theory of law or
equity of, or violation by, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
affiliates.

9.3 _Indemnification of Stockholder Indemnitees_. From and after the Closing
and subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 9, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholders and
each of their respective officers, directors, managers, trustees,
beneficiaries, agents, employees, successors and assigns (collectively, the
"Stockholder Indemnitees") from any Losses suffered or incurred by any of them
as a result of, or arising out of:

(a) any untruth, inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of
Parent or Merger Sub (determined without regard to any qualification or
exception contained 

 



54  therein relating to materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect or any
similar qualification or standard); or

(b) any breach of any agreement or covenant of Parent or Merger Sub, or
following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation, contained in this Agreement;

 

regardless, in any case, of whether such Losses arise as a result of the
negligence, strict liability or any liability under any theory of law or
equity of, or violation by, the Stockholders or any of their respective
affiliates. Each Stockholder Indemnitee shall be a third party beneficiary of
the Parents indemnification obligations under the Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , each such Stockholder Indemnitees rights shall be exercised
solely by and through the Stockholder Representative as provided herein.

9.4 _Indemnification Procedure_.

(a) _Third Party Claims_. Except with respect to Tax Claims, which are
addressed in _Section 7.6_, if a person entitled or claiming to be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to _Sections 9.2_ or _9.3_ (such person, an "
_Indemnitee_ ") in respect of any action or the assertion of any claim,
liability or obligation by a third party, against which claim, liability or
obligation a person is, or may be, required under _Sections 9.2_ or _9.3_ to
indemnify Indemnitee (such person, an " _Indemnitor_ "), an Indemnitee shall
promptly notify Indemnitor in writing of the commencement or assertion thereof
(the " _Claim Notice_ ") and give Indemnitor a copy of such claim, process and
all legal pleadings relating thereto. Indemnitor shall have the right to
contest and conduct the defense of such action by giving written notice to
Indemnitee of its election to do so within ten (10) Business Days of the
receipt of the Claim Notice, and Indemnitee may participate in such defense
by counsel of its own choosing at its own expense _provided_ that, prior to
assuming control of such defense, the Indemnitor must acknowledge that it may
have an indemnity obligation for Losses resulting from such action as
provided under this _Article 9_. Indemnitee shall not settle or compromise any
claim, action or proceeding for which Indemnitee is seeking indemnification
under this _Article 9_ without the prior written consent of Indemnitor, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Indemnitor assumes control of the
defense of any action in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
9.4(a)_, the Indemnitor shall not settle such action unless (i) such
settlement is on exclusively monetary terms and the Indemnitor shall pay or
cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement either
concurrently or with the effectiveness thereof and such settlement includes a
complete and irrevocable general release executed by all persons who brought
such action, which release shall release the Indemnitee from any liability
without prejudice, or (ii) the Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to
the terms of such settlement. In circumstances where the Indemnitor is
controlling the defense of an action in accordance with this _Section
9.4(a)_, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the defense of the
action and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose, in
which case the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by
the Indemnitee; _provided_ that in such event the Indemnitor shall pay the
fees and expenses of such separate counsel (x) incurred by the Indemnitee
prior to the date of the Indemnitor assuming control of the defense of the
action or (y) if representation of both the Indemnitor and Indemnitee by the
same counsel would create a conflict of interest. Failure of Indemnitee to
give the Claim Notice to Indemnitor promptly shall not affect Indemnitees
rights to indemnification hereunder, except if (and then only to the

 



55  extent that) Indemnitor incurs additional expenses or Indemnitors defense
of such claim is actually prejudiced by reason of such failure to give timely
notice.

 

(b) _Direct Claims_. With respect to claims other than third-party claims,
which are addressed in _Section 9.4(a)_, Indemnitee shall use reasonable
efforts promptly to notify Indemnitor of such claims, but failure of
Indemnitee to give such notice to Indemnitor shall not affect the rights of
Indemnitee to indemnification hereunder, except (i) as provided in  _Section
9.1_ above, and (ii) if (and then only to the extent that) Indemnitor incurs
additional expenses or Indemnitor is actually prejudiced by reason of such
failure to give timely notice.

 

9.5 _Limitations_.

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Article 9_ or _Section 7.5_ (but
subject to the provisions of _Sections 9.6(c)_ and _9.6(d)_ relating to the
reduction of the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the proportional reduction of the
MDP Stockholders obligations hereunder, respectively):

 

(i) except in respect of Fundamental Representations, no Indemnitee shall be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to  _Section 9.2(a)_ or _9.3(a)_ (as
applicable) for Losses resulting from any single claim that does not exceed
$75,000;

(ii) except in respect of Fundamental Representations, no Indemnitee shall be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ or _9.3(a)_ (as
applicable) unless and until the total of all Losses suffered or incurred by
the Indemnitee exceeds an amount equal to $21,062,500, and then only to the
extent of such excess;

(iii) in no event shall the aggregate amount to be paid for Losses and Tax
Losses incurred by the Stockholder Indemnitees, on the one hand, or the Parent
Indemnitees and Parent Tax Indemnitees, on the other hand, for which such
Indemnitees (including, as applicable any Parent Tax Indemnitee) is entitled
to indemnification under this Agreement exceed $125,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "),
and, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall (i) any Other
Stockholders liability under this Agreement exceed such Other Stockholders
interest in its Pro Rata Portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount multiplied by
the Cap, or (ii) the MDP Stockholders liability under this Agreement exceed
the MDP Stockholders Pro Rata Portion multiplied by the Cap;

(iv) in no event shall the amount to be paid by the MDP Stockholder in
respect of any claim for indemnification under this Agreement exceed their
aggregate MDP Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of such claim; and

 

(v) in no event shall the aggregate amount to be paid by any Other Stockholder
in respect of a claim for indemnification under this Agreement exceed such
Other Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of such claim.

(b) In no event shall any party hereto be liable for, nor shall the
definition of Losses and Tax Loss include (other than with respect to amounts
actually paid in respect of third party claims), any indirect, incidental,
special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including loss of
future revenue, income or profits, or loss of business reputation or

 



56  opportunity (provided that none of the foregoing shall include diminution in
value), arising out of a breach in this Agreement, even if advised at the time
of breach of the possibility of such damages.

(c) In no event shall the Stockholders be liable under this Agreement for any
Loss or Tax Loss to the extent an adequate provision or reserve for such Loss
or Tax Loss was established in the Financial Statements (and in the case of a
Tax Loss, specifically identified in the related Tax reserve work papers) or
the matter giving rise to such Loss or Tax Loss was otherwise addressed in
the Closing Funds Certificate.

(d) In no event shall the Stockholders be liable for any Loss (i) that was
caused by or results directly from any failure by Parent and its affiliates
(including, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries) to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such
Loss, or (ii) that is primarily a potential or unrealized Loss or Tax Loss
(until such Loss or Tax Loss is realized (subject to the last sentence of
_Section 9.1_)). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, indemnification for breach
of any representation or warranty contained in _Section 3.18_ shall be
limited to Losses incurred with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

 

(e) The amount of any Loss or Tax Loss for which indemnification is provided
under this _Article 9_ shall be reduced to reflect: (i) any amount received
by such Indemnitee (or, as applicable, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries) with respect thereto under any insurance coverage (other than
self insured or other policies to the extent to which any such policy
allocates the cost of any recovery to the Indemnitee or its affiliates
(including, as applicable, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries)) or from any other person alleged to be responsible therefore,
and (ii) associated Tax reductions actually realized with respect to such
Losses.

9.6 _Manner of Payment; Indemnity Escrow Release_. 

(a) _Manner of Payment_. Any payment to the Parent Tax Indemnitees or the
Parent Indemnitees in respect of any claim for indemnification properly
asserted by the Parent Tax Indemnitees or the Parent Indemnitees under
_Section 7.5_ or _Section 9.2_ shall be paid as follows:

 

(i) each MDP Stockholder shall pay its Pro Rata Portion of the amount of such
claim by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Parent within five (5) Business Days after the date of the final
determination of any amounts due and owing under this _Article 9_ ; and

 

(ii) the Stockholders Representative shall cause each Other Stockholders Pro
Rata Portion of the amount of such claim to be paid by release of funds to
the Parent Tax Indemnitees or the Parent Indemnitees, as applicable, from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund by the Indemnity Escrow Agent, such release to be made
concurrently with payment by the MDP Stockholders pursuant to _Section
9.6(a)(i)_ above.

(b) _Joint Written Instructions_. Upon the final determination of any amounts
to be paid from the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to this _Section 9.6_,
Parent and the

 



57  Stockholder Representative shall execute joint written instructions to the
Indemnity Escrow Agent instructing the Indemnity Escrow Agent to disburse the
Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with this _Section 9.6_.

(c) _Release of Escrow Funds_.

 

(i) On the First Anniversary Date, the Indemnity Escrow Agent shall release an
amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund to or for the account of the Other
Stockholders equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the initial Indemnity
Escrow Fund _less_ the aggregate amount, if any, previously paid to Parent out
of the Indemnity Escrow Fund; _provided_ that such amount released to or for
the account of the Other Stockholders pursuant to this _Section 9.6(c)(i)_
shall be reduced to the extent that the amount remaining in the Indemnity
Escrow Fund in the absence of such reduction would be less than the aggregate
amount of bona fide claims for indemnification properly asserted against the
Indemnity Escrow Fund by the Parent Tax Indemnities and Parent Indemnities
under _Sections 7.5_ and _9.2_ , respectively, but not yet resolved
(such unresolved claims and any subsequent claims that remain unresolved, the
" _Unresolved Indemnification Claims_ ") as of the First Anniversary Date.

(ii) On the Second Anniversary Date, the Indemnity Escrow Agent shall release
all or a portion of the remaining Indemnity Escrow Fund to or for the account
of the Other Stockholders such that, following such release, the amount
remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, if any, equals the aggregate amount of
Unresolved Indemnification Claims as of the Second Anniversary Date.

 

(iii) To the extent applicable, the amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund
retained for the Unresolved Indemnification Claims shall be released by the
Indemnity Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement to or for the account of the Other Stockholders (to the extent not
utilized to pay the Parent Indemnitees for any such claims resolved in favor
of the Parent Indemnitees) upon the resolution of such claims in accordance
with this _Section 9.6_ and the terms of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement.

 

(iv) In connection with the release of all or a portion of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund by the Indemnity Escrow Agent to or for the account of the Other
Stockholders in accordance with this _Section 9.6(c)_ and the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement, each Other Stockholder shall receive its Pro Rata Portion of
the Indemnity Escrow Fund so released.

 

(d) _Proportionate Reduction in MDP Stockholder Obligations_. The MDP
Stockholders liability hereunder and under the MDP Limited Guaranty shall be
reduced in the same proportion as any reduction in the Indemnity Escrow Amount
made pursuant to _Section 9.6(c)(i)_.

9.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Following the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy,
other than with respect to claims for fraud, for any party hereto for any
claim (whether such claim is framed in tort, contract or otherwise) arising
out of any untruth, inaccuracy or breach of any

 



58  representation, warranty, agreement or covenant in this Agreement or with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Article 7_ or this  _Article 9_. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, other than with respect to claims
for fraud, no claim shall be brought or maintained by any Parent Indemnitee
against the Stockholders for any claim (whether such claim is framed in tort,
contract or otherwise) arising out of any untruth, inaccuracy or breach of any
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant in this Agreement or with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby other than in compliance with
and pursuant to _Article 7_ or this _Article 9_. Except as provided in this
Agreement, none of the Stockholders or Parent (or, as applicable, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries) shall be entitled to any
rights of contribution or set-off against the other party(ies) hereto
(including, as applicable, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries) following the Closing. Except for claims under the Written
Consent, under no circumstances shall any Parent Indemnitee make any claim,
demand or otherwise seek any remedy or recovery from or against any Other
Stockholder under or related to this Agreement; rather, any and all such
claims, demands, remedies or recoveries from or against any Other Stockholder
shall be pursuant to, and recourse solely against, the Indemnity Escrow Fund.
Except for claims under the Written Consent or the MDP Limited Guaranty, under
no circumstances shall any Parent Indemnitee make any claim, demand or
otherwise seek any remedy or recovery from or against the MDP Stockholder in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than as
expressly provided, and subject to the limitations contained in, this
Agreement.

 

9.8 _Treatment of Payment_. Any indemnification payments made pursuant to
_Article 7_ or this _Article 9_ shall be treated as adjustments to purchase
price.

9.9 _Subrogation_. Upon making any indemnification payment under this
_Article 9_ , the Indemnitor will, to the extent of such payment, be
subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee against any third party in respect
of the Loss to which the payment relates; _provided_ , _however_ , that until
the Indemnitee recovers full payment of its Loss, any and all claims of the
Indemnitor against any such third party on account of said payment are hereby
made expressly subordinated and subjected in right of payment to the
Indemnitees rights against such third party. Without limiting the generality
of any other provision hereof, each such Indemnitee and Indemnitor shall duly
execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and
perfect the above-described subrogation and subordination rights. 

ARTICLE 10

of the condition contained in _Section 8.1(a)_ or _8.1(b)_ not being
satisfied, either the Company or Parent shall have the right to extend the
Outside Date for up to 45 days for the sole and exclusive purpose of
permitting the satisfaction of such condition; _provided_ , _further_ , that
in the event that the Outside Date is extended pursuant to the immediately
foregoing proviso and the Closing shall not have occurred by such Outside Date
(as so extended) by virtue of either (i) the condition contained in _Section
8.1(a)(iii)_ or _Section 8.1(a)(iv)_ not being satisfied, or (ii) the
condition contained in _Section 8.1(b)_ not being satisfied as a result of

in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the proposed ownership
or control, directly or indirectly, in the Surviving Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries by any of the GS Funds or any of their respective affiliates
following the Closing (except to the extent such failure of such condition
results from errors in the country-by-country sales data provided by the

Outside Date for up to an additional 45 days for the sole and exclusive

failure or termination); _provided, further_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this  _Section 10.1(c)_ shall not be available to or on
behalf of any party whose action or failure to act has been the primary cause
of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to be consummated on or prior to
such date;

 

(d) by Parent, within six (6) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, if

(e) by Parent if there is any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, such that
the conditions specified in  _Section 8.2_ would not be satisfied at the
Closing (a " _Terminating Company Breach_ "), except that, if such Terminating
Company Breach is curable by the Company through the exercise of commercially
reasonable efforts, then, for a period of up to sixty (60) days, but only as
long as the Company continues to use commercially reasonable efforts to cure
such breach (the " _Company Cure Period_ "), such termination shall not be
effective, and such termination shall become effective only if the
Terminating Company Breach is not cured within the Company Cure Period;
_provided_ the right to terminate under this _Section 10.1(e)_ shall not be
available to the Parent if the Company would then be entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(f)(i)_ (or would be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(f)(i)_ after the requisite
cure period if the Parent does not cure any applicable Terminating Parent
Breach); or

that if such Terminating Parent Breach is curable by Parent or Merger Sub

60  period of up to sixty (60) days, but only as long as Parent or Merger Sub,
as applicable, continues to use commercially reasonable efforts to cure such
Terminating Parent Breach (the " _Parent Cure Period_ "), such termination
shall not be effective, and such termination shall become effective only if
the Terminating Parent Breach is not cured within the Parent Cure Period;
_provided_ the right to terminate under this _Section 10.1(f)_ (i) shall not
be available to the Company if Parent would then be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(e)_ (or would be entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 10.1(e)_ after the requisite cure
period if the Company does not cure any applicable Terminating Company
Breach), or (ii) all of the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_
have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied at the Closing or, in the case or _Section 8.2(d)_, two (2)
Business Days prior to Closing) (and the period specified for Closing in the
proviso to _Section 1.2_ shall not be pending and shall have lapsed), the
Company provides notice to Parent that the Company is prepared to consummate
the Closing and Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing at the date
the Closing should have occurred in accordance with _Section 1.2_.

10.2 _Parent Termination Fee_.

 

(a) If this Agreement is validly terminated by:

(i) the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)_ and at the time of
such termination this Agreement could have been terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section 10.1(f)_ (ignoring for the purpose of this _Section
10.2(a)_ any right that Parent may have to cure any Terminating Parent
Breach);

(ii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 10.1(f)_;

 

(iii) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)_ or _Section
10.1(c)_ as a result of the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
_Section 8.1(a)(i), 8(a)(ii)_ or _Section 8.1(a)(iv)_ to be satisfied;

(iv) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)_ or _Section
10.1(c)_ as a result of the failure of the condition set forth in _Section
8.1(a)(iii)_ to be satisfied and there was a South Africa Clearance Issue; or

(v) by the Company or Parent pursuant to  _Section 10.1(b)_ or _Section
10.1(c)_ as a result of the failure of the condition set forth in _Section
8.1(a)(iii)_ to be satisfied and there was not a South Africa Clearance Issue;

 

(vi) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)_ or _Section
10.1(c)_ as a result of the failure of the condition set forth in _Section
8.1(b)_ to be satisfied as a result of a Section 10.1(c)(ii) Event;

then Parent shall (x) pay the Parent Termination Fee to the Company and (y)
reimburse the Company for the aggregate amount of fees, costs and expenses
required to be reimbursed by Parent under  _Sections 5.2_ , _5.3_ and _5.4_
(such amount, the " _Expense Reimbursement Amount_ "). In the event the Parent
Termination Fee is payable, such fee shall be paid by Parent in cash, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
by the Company, within one (1) Business Day after the date on which this
Agreement is terminated. In the event the Expense Reimbursement 

 



61  Amount is payable, such amount shall be paid by Parent in cash, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
by the Company, promptly upon receipt of the Companys written request
therefor (in the event such amount is owed pursuant to _Section 5.2_ or
_Section 5.3_) and promptly following the delivery of reasonable
documentation of such amount (in the event such amount is owed pursuant to
_Section 5.4_). Without limiting the availability of specific performance of
the obligation to close contemplated by _Section 12.9_ prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement, the payment by Parent of the Parent
Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement Amount shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses or damages
of any kind, character or description suffered or incurred by the Company or
any other person in connection with this Agreement and, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement that may be deemed to the contrary, (A) receipt of
the Parent Termination Fee (including enforcement of the Limited Guarantees
with respect thereto) and the Expense Reimbursement Amount, plus any interest
and costs incurred by or on behalf of the Company in enforcing the provisions
of this _Section 10.2_ (and any other provisions of this Agreement in
connection therewith) as provided in  _Section 10.2(b),_ shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Company and its affiliates (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Stockholders) against Parent, Merger Sub, the
Financing Sources and any of its or their former, current or future
affiliates, affiliated (or commonly advised) funds and any directors,
officers, employees, stockholders, partners, members, managers or other
Representatives of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Parent
Related Parties_ ") in connection with the termination of this Agreement, the
Limited Guarantees, the Financing Commitments and/or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and (B) upon payment of the Parent Termination
Fee and the Expense Reimbursement Amount, plus any interest and costs
incurred by or behalf of the Company in enforcing the provisions of this
_Section 10.2_ (and any other provisions of this Agreement in connection
therewith) as provided in  _Section 10.2(b)_, none of the Parent Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation or any other obligation
for any other liabilities, obligations, losses or damages of any kind,
character or description relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Limited Guarantees and/or the Financing Commitments and/or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (other than pursuant to the Sponsor
Confidentiality Agreements); _provided_ , _however_ , this  _Section
10.2(a)_ shall not limit the right of the Company to specific performance of
this Agreement pursuant to, and subject to the limitations in, _Section 12.9_
prior to the valid termination of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
(x) under no circumstances shall the Company be entitled to collect the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion (or, after the receipt thereof, any
further funds other than the Expense Reimbursement Amount or pursuant to
_Section 10.2(b)_), (y) under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted
or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of the obligation
to close contemplated by _Section 12.9_ and the Parent Termination Fee, and
(z) in no event shall the Parent Related Parties be subject to (nor shall the
Company or its affiliates seek to recover) monetary damages in excess of the
Parent Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement Amount, plus any
interest and costs incurred by or behalf of the Company in enforcing the
provisions of this _Section 10.2_ (and any other provisions of this Agreement
in connection therewith) as provided in _Section 10.2(b_), for any and
all liabilities,

 



62 obligations, losses or damages of any kind, character or description suffered
or incurred by the Company or any other Person in connection with this
Agreement (other than pursuant to the Sponsor Confidentiality Agreements). The
Company further agrees that from and after the termination of this Agreement,
the maximum aggregate liability of Parent, Merger Sub and all of the other
Parent Related Parties, taken as a whole, shall be limited to an amount equal
to the Parent Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement Amount, plus any
interest and costs incurred by or on behalf of the Company in enforcing the
provisions of this _Section 10.2_ (and any other provisions of this Agreement
in connection therewith) as provided in _Section 10.2(b)_, and in no event
shall the Company seek to recover, or be entitled to recover, any money
damages or other Losses in excess of such amount (other than pursuant to the
Sponsor Confidentiality Agreements). In no event shall the Company seek (I)
any equitable remedy or specific performance from, or in respect of,
any Financing Source, or (II) to recover monetary damages from any Parent
Related Party in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Financing), other than, in the cases of clauses (I) and (II)
Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement, the Limited Guarantors under the
Limited Guarantees or the Persons (other than the Company) party to the
Sponsor Confidentiality Agreements.

(b) If Parent fails to promptly pay the Parent Termination Fee or the Expense
Reimbursement Amount when due, Parent shall pay to the Company, as applicable,
(i) its costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel) in connection with enforcing its rights under this _Section 10.2_
and (ii) interest on the amount payable pursuant to such judgment, compounded
quarterly, at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as
published in the _Wall Street Journal_ , calculated on a daily basis from the
date the Company had the right to terminate this Agreement until the date of
actual payment.

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in this _Section 10.2_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this
_Section 10.2_ do not constitute a penalty.

performance to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by such party,
and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants and obligations of such party under this Agreement all in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 12.9_. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such
order or injunction in all accordance with the terms of this _Section 12.9_.
Each party further agrees that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in
_Section 12.9_, a party shall not (subject to the limitations in _Section
10.2_) in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that
may be available to such party under this Agreement, the Equity Financing
Letters or the Limited Guarantees in the event that this Agreement has been
terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this _Section
12.9_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, (ii) nothing set forth
in this _Section 12.9_ shall require any party hereto to institute any
proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute any proceeding for)
specific performance hereunder prior to, or as a condition to, exercising any
termination right under _Article 1_ 0, nor shall the commencement of any legal
proceeding pursuant to this _Section 12.9_ or anything set forth in this 
_Section 12.9_ restrict or limit any partys right thereafter to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article 10_ or pursue any
other remedies under this Agreement, the Equity Financing Letters or the
Limited Guarantees that may be available then or thereafter and (iii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in clause (i) or (ii) of
this _Section 12.9(c)_, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted
or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of the obligation
to close contemplated by this _Section 12.9_ and all or a portion of the
Parent Termination Fee. If a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to
specifically enforce the obligations of a breaching party to consummate the
Merger pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought against such
breaching party, and has instead granted an award of damages for such alleged
breach, and this Agreement has terminated, then (i) the Company, as non-
breaching party, may enforce such award, but only up to the amount of the
Parent Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement Amount, ( _plus_ any
interest and costs incurred by or on behalf of the Company in enforcing the
provisions of _Section 10.2_ (and any other provisions of this Agreement in
connection therewith) as provided in _Section 10.2(b)_, and accept the Parent
Termination Fee for such alleged breach on behalf of the Stockholders, or
(ii) Parent or Merger Sub, as non-breaching parties, may enforce such award
and accept damages for such alleged breach but only up to the amount of the
Parent Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement Amount,  _plus_ any
interest and costs incurred by or on behalf of the Company in enforcing the
provisions of Section 10.2 (and any other provisions of this Agreement in
connection therewith) as provided in _Section 10.2(b)_.

 

(d) For the sake of clarity, in no event shall specific performance be
available to the Company in respect of any Financing Source;  _provided_ that
nothing in this _Section 12.9(d)_ shall prevent the Company or Parent from
seeking and obtaining specific performance against the Limited Guarantors
under the Limited Guarantees or the Equity Financing Letters in accordance
with the terms and conditions hereof and thereof.

12.11 _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH

ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY

INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND

NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B)
EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATION OF THIS WAIVER, (C)
EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 12.11_.

12.12 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under Applicable Law but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any respect under any Applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision
had never been contained herein, so long as the economic and legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in a manner
materially adverse to any party hereto.
