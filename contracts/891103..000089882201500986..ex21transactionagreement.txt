transfer providing for the contributions set forth in this Section 2.03, and

          (b) Prior to Closing, the Parent Parties shall agree upon a schedule

          SECTION 2.04. Other Transactions. On the Closing Date,

     Warrant Agreement and (B) USAi shall issue and deliver Warrants to

     Schedule 2.04; provided, that if any event shall have occurred after the
     close of business on November 30, 2001 (the "Reference Date") and on or
     prior to the Closing Date that would result in an adjustment to the
     number of shares purchasable upon the exercise of Warrants under Article
     IV of the Warrant Agreement if such Warrants had been issued on the
     Reference Date, USAi shall issue and deliver to Universal Warrants to
     purchase the number of shares set forth on Schedule 2.04 as so adjusted,

     Partnership Agreement, which will be payable to USANi Sub on the Closing
     Date out of the proceeds of such debt.

          SECTION 2.05. Assignment of Contracts and Rights. Anything in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, except as set forth on Schedule
2.05, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Contract
or License or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or
resulting therefrom, or an assumption of liability thereunder, if an attempted
assignment thereof, without the approval of a party thereto, would be


<PAGE>


                                                                             5

ineffective or would constitute a breach or other contravention thereof or
give rise to any right of termination thereof, as a direct result of such
assignment. Each Parent Party shall use its reasonable best efforts (which
shall not require any payment of money) to obtain the approval of the other
parties to any such Contract or License, or any claim or right or any benefit
arising thereunder, for the assignment thereof to, and the assumption by, the
Partnership. If as of the Closing Date an attempted assignment and assumption
thereof would be ineffective or would give rise to any right of termination
thereof, each Parent Party shall cooperate in arranging a mutually agreeable
alternative to enable the Partnership to obtain the benefits and assume the
obligations under such Contract or License in accordance with this Agreement
as of the Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter (including through
a sub-contracting, sub-licensing, or sub- leasing arrangement, or an
arrangement under which such Parent Party or one of its Affiliates would
enforce such Contract or License for the benefit of the Partnership, with the
Partnership assuming such Parent Party's or its Affiliate's obligations and
any and all rights of such Parent Party or its Affiliate against the other
party thereto). If the approval of the other party is obtained, such approval
shall constitute a confirmation (automatically and without further action of
the parties) that such Contract or License is assigned to the Partnership as
of the Closing Date, and (automatically and without further action of the
parties) that the liabilities with respect to such Contract or License are
assumed by the Partnership as of the Closing Date. The agreements set forth on
Schedule 2.05 will apply with respect to the USAi Contracts described therein.

          SECTION 2.06. Closing Date. The closing of the transactions set
forth in this Article II (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of
Cravath, Swaine & Moore, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019, at 10:00
a.m. on the second Business Day following the satisfaction (or to the extent
permitted, the waiver) of all the conditions to the parties' obligations set
forth in Article V (other than those requiring the delivery of documents or
the taking of other action at the Closing), or at such other place, time and
date as the parties hereto shall agree (the "Closing Date").

          SECTION 2.07. Assignment of Rights by Diller. Diller may assign
beneficial interests in the right to receive up to an aggregate of 10% of the
Common Interests (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) that Diller is
entitled to receive upon the Closing to one or more Persons


<PAGE>


                                                                             6



designated by Diller prior to Closing; provided that no more than four such
Persons may be designated. For any such assignment to be effective, such
assignee shall have agreed, pursuant to an instrument in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Universal, to be bound by the terms of Section 6.07 of the
Partnership Agreement.


                                  ARTICLE III

               Representations and Warranties of Parent Parties

          Representations and warranties of USAi relating to (i) the portions
of its Existing Business contained in USA Cable, Studios USA or their
respective subsidiaries speak only as to the period between February 13, 1998,
and the date hereof and (ii) the portions of its Existing Business contained
in USA Films and its subsidiaries speak only as to the period between May 29,
1999, and the date hereof (it being understood that matters existing prior to
(x) February 13, 1998, in the case of clause (i) above, and (y) May 29, 1999,
in the case of clause (ii) above, shall not be deemed to be a breach of a
representation or warranty that speaks on and after such respective date).
Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, each Parent Party (unless
otherwise specified), with respect to itself and, as applicable, with respect
to its Affiliates, represents and warrants to the other Parent Party as
follows:

          SECTION 3.01. Organization, Standing and Power. Each of such Parent
Party and its Transaction Affiliate(s) (i) is duly organized or formed,
validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which
recognize such concept) under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is so
organized or formed and (ii) has full corporate or limited liability company
power and authority to perform and comply with all the terms and conditions of
each Transaction Document to which it is, or is specified to be, a party. Each
of such Parent Party and its Transaction Affiliate(s) is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation or limited liability company and is in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business transacted by it or the
character or location of the properties owned or leased by it requires such
qualification, except where failure to be so qualified would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.02. Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability.
Each of such Parent Party and its Affiliates has full power and authority to
execute and


<PAGE>


                                                                             7

deliver the Transaction Documents to which it is, or is specified to be, a
party and to consummate the Transactions to which it is, or is specified to
be, a party. The execution, delivery and performance by each of such Parent
Party and its Affiliates of the Transaction Documents to which it is, or is
specified to be, a party and the consummation by each of such Parent Party and
its Affiliates of the Transactions to which it is, or is specified to be, a
party have been (or, with respect to such Affiliates, prior to the Closing
Date will be) duly authorized by all necessary corporate or limited liability
company action subject, in the case of USAi, to receipt of the USAi
Stockholder Approvals, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of such
Parent Party or its Affiliates are necessary to authorize this Agreement or
the consummation of the Transactions. Each of such Parent Party and its
Affiliates has duly executed and delivered this Agreement (to the extent a
party hereto) and prior to the Effective Time will have duly executed and
delivered each other Transaction Document to which it is, or is specified to
be, a party, and this Agreement constitutes, and each other Transaction
Document to which it is, or is specified to be, a party will, after the
Effective Time (assuming the execution and delivery by each other party
thereto), constitute its legal, valid and binding obligations, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms. The USAi Board formed a special
committee of the USAi Board, composed of the four disinterested directors on
the USAi Board (the "Special Committee"), to consider this Agreement, the
other Transaction Documents to which USAi is a party and the Transactions, and
to make a recommendation with respect thereto to the entire USAi Board. The
Special Committee, at a meeting duly called and held at which all members of
the Special Committee were present either in person or by telephone, (x)
received the opinion of Bear, Stearns & Co. to the effect that the
consideration to be received by USAi in the Transactions is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the stockholders of USAi other than Universal,
Liberty, Diller and their Affiliates, and (y) duly and unanimously (and
without any abstentions) adopted resolutions (i) declaring advisable this
Agreement, (ii) determining that the terms of the Transactions are fair to and
in the best interests of the public stockholders of USAi, other than
stockholders party to the Transactions, and (iii) recommending that the USAi
Board approve this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents to which USAi is
a party and the Transactions, and that the USAi Board declare the advisability
of this Agreement. After receiving and considering such resolutions of the
Special Committee, the USAi Board, at a meeting duly called and held at which
all directors of USAi were present either in person or by

telephone, duly adopted resolutions (i) approving and declaring advisable this

          SECTION 3.06. Financial Statements; No Undisclosed Liabilities. (a)
USAi represents and warrants to Universal that (i) the consolidated financial
statements of USAi included in the documents filed by USAi with the SEC since
January 1, 2000, through the date hereof (the "USAi SEC Documents") comply as
to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States ("U.S. GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of USAi
and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments). Except as set forth in the USAi SEC Documents, as of the date of
this Agreement, neither USAi nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities
or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) required by U.S. GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance
sheet or in the notes thereto and that, individually or in the aggregate,
would have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (ii) USAi has delivered to Universal a copy of the unaudited interim
balance sheet of USAi's Existing Business as of September 30, 2001 (the
"Balance Sheet"). The Balance Sheet has been prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP, from the books and records of USAi, and presents fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of USAi's Existing Business as of the date
thereof, subject to normal year-end adjustments. Except as set forth in the
Balance Sheet, as of the date thereof, neither USAi nor any of its
subsidiaries had any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) arising primarily out of the
conduct of USAi's Existing Business and required by U.S. GAAP to be set forth
on a consolidated balance sheet or in the notes thereto and that,

                                                                            13

individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (b) Universal represents and warrants to USAi that the consolidated
financial statements of Vivendi included in the documents filed by Vivendi
with the SEC since January 1, 2000, through the date hereof (the "Vivendi SEC
Documents") comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in France ("French GAAP") applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto)
and present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Vivendi and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof
and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments). Except as set forth in the Vivendi SEC Documents,
as of the date of this Agreement, neither Vivendi nor any of its subsidiaries
has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) required by French GAAP to be set forth on a
consolidated balance sheet or in the notes thereto and that, individually or
in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.07. Contracts. USAi's SEC Reports complied in all material
respects with the disclosure requirements of Item 601 of Regulation S-K.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.07 and except as would not have a Material
Adverse Effect, all of the Material Contracts are in full force and effect and
are valid and binding agreements of USAi or its Affiliates and, to the
knowledge of USAi, the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with
their terms. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.07, to the knowledge of USAi,
no party is in default in any material respect under any of the Material
Contracts, nor does any condition exist that with notice or the lapse of time
or both would constitute such a default. Except for the need to obtain the
Consents listed on Schedule 3.03 and except as would not have a Material
Adverse Effect, the Transactions will not affect the validity or
enforceability of any of the Material Contracts. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.07 or as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, as of the date
of this Agreement, no party to any Material Contract has informed USAi or, to
USAi's knowledge, its Affiliates, of its intention (x) to terminate such
Material Contract or amend the material terms thereof, (y) to refuse to renew
such Material Contract upon


<PAGE>


                                                                            14

expiration of its term, or (z) to renew such Material Contract upon expiration
only on terms and conditions that are more onerous to its Existing Business,
as the case may be, than those now existing.

          SECTION 3.08. Contributed Assets. (a) Such Parent Party owns,
directly or indirectly, and has good and valid title to all such Parent
Party's Contributed Assets, free and clear of all Liens, except Permitted
Liens.

          (b) Neither such Parent Party nor any of its Affiliates owns (or
will own as of the Closing) any asset, property or right, tangible or
intangible, that is primarily used in the business or operations of its
Existing Business, other than, in each case, such assets, properties and
rights that are being Contributed to the Partnership in accordance with this
Agreement. Such Parent Party's Contributed Assets are sufficient for the
conduct of its business by the Partnership immediately following the Closing
in substantially the same manner as currently conducted by such Parent Party.

          SECTION 3.09. Real Property. No fee estates are included in the
Material Real Property. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.09, USAi or an
Affiliate thereof has good title to all the Material Real Property, free and
clear of all Liens or other restrictions on the Material Real Property, except
for Permitted Liens. Except for that portion of the Material Real Property
subject to leases where USAi is lessor or sublessor and except as would not
have a Material Adverse Effect, USAi is in possession of, and has full legal
and practical access to, the Material Real Property. As of the date hereof
there are no pending or, to the knowledge of USAi, threatened condemnation or
appropriation proceedings against any of the Material Real Property, except as
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. With respect to each leasehold or
subleasehold interest included in the Material Real Property, USAi or its
Affiliate has enforceable rights to nondisturbance and quiet enjoyment, and no
third party holds any interest in the leased premises with the right to
foreclose upon such leasehold or subleasehold interest, except as would not
have a Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.10. Intangible Property. Except (i) as set forth on
Schedule 3.10 or (ii) as has arisen in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice and without material diminution of the value
thereof, to the knowledge of USAi, no other person has any claim of ownership
or right of use with respect to its Intangible Property. The use of such
Intangible Property by USAi's

                                                                            15

Existing Business does not, and the use by the Partnership immediately after
the Closing will not, conflict with, infringe upon, violate, or interfere with
or constitute an appropriation of any right, title, interest, or goodwill,
including any intellectual property right, patent, trademark, trade name,
service mark, brand name, computer program, database, industrial design,
copyright, or any pending application therefor of any other Person (except for
such conflicts, infringements, violations or appropriations as would not have
a Material Adverse Effect), and, to the knowledge of USAi, there have been no
claims made, and USAi's Existing Business has not received any written notice,
that any such item of Intangible Property is invalid or conflicts with the
asserted rights of any Person (other than such invalidity or conflicts as
would not have a Material Adverse Effect).

          SECTION 3.11. Licenses. Each material License of USAi's Existing
Business has been validly issued and is in full force and effect, and USAi, or
an Affiliate thereof, is the authorized legal holder thereof and has complied
in all material respects with all the terms and conditions thereof. As of the
date hereof, there is no Proceeding pending or, to USAi's knowledge,
threatened, seeking the revocation, modification (in a manner adverse to
USAi's Existing Business) or limitation of any material License of USAi's
Existing Business, and no such License will be subject to suspension,
modification, revocation or non-renewal as a result of the execution of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, except for such
suspensions, modifications, revocations or non-renewals as would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. USAi possesses all material Licenses to own or hold
under lease and operate its Contributed Assets that are necessary to enable it
to conduct its Existing Business as currently conducted.

          SECTION 3.12. Absence of Changes or Events. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.12 and except as disclosed in such Parent Party's SEC Reports,
since December 31, 2000 through the date hereof, (i) such Parent Party has
caused its Existing Business to be conducted in the ordinary course and in
substantially the same manner as previously conducted and (ii) there has not
been any Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.13. Compliance with Applicable Laws. Except as disclosed
in such Parent Party's SEC Reports, the Existing Business of such Parent Party
has been and is presently being conducted in compliance with all Applicable
Laws, including those relating to the environment, except for instances of
noncompliance that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. Except

Affiliates has received any written communication during the past year from a
Governmental Entity that alleges that its Existing Business is not in
compliance in any material respect with any Applicable Laws and (ii) neither
such Parent Party nor any of its Affiliates has received any written notice
that any investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to
any of its Contributed Assets or its Existing Business is pending or that any
such investigation is contemplated.

disclosed in such Parent Party's SEC Reports, there are not any (i)
outstanding Judgments against or affecting such Parent Party, its Affiliates
or its Contributed Assets or Contributed Subsidiaries, or (ii) claims,
actions, suits, proceedings, arbitrations, investigations, inquiries, or
hearings or notices of hearings (collectively, "Proceedings") pending or, to
the knowledge of such Parent Party, threatened against or affecting such
Parent Party, its Affiliates or its Contributed Assets or Contributed
Subsidiaries, by or against any Governmental Entity or any other Person, that
in any manner challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin, materially alter or
materially delay the Transactions or that, individually or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.15. Universal Contributed Interests. Universal represents
and warrants to USAi that, as of the Closing Date, all the outstanding shares
of capital stock or other ownership interests of each Universal Contributed
Interest will have been duly authorized and validly issued and will have been
fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to or issued in violation of any
purchase option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right,
subscription right or any similar right under any provision of the DGCL, if
applicable, the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other organizational
documents of such Universal Contributed Interest or any Contract to which such
Universal Contributed Interest is a party or otherwise bound. As of the
Closing Date, there will not be any bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of any such Universal Contributed Interest having the right to
vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to
vote) on any matters on which holders of capital stock or other ownership
interests of such Universal Contributed Interest may vote ("Voting Contributed
Interest Debt"). As of the Closing Date, there will not be any options,
warrants, rights, convertible or exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock
rights, stock appreciation

                                                                            17

rights, stock-based performance units, commitments, Contracts or undertakings
of any kind to which any such Universal Contributed Interest is a party or by
which any of them is bound (i) obligating such Universal Contributed Interest
to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold,
additional shares of capital stock or other ownership interests in, or any
security convertible or exercisable for or exchangeable into any capital stock
of or other ownership interests in, any such Universal Contributed Interest or
Voting Contributed Interest Debt, (ii) obligating such Universal Contributed
Interest to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call,
right, security, commitment, Contract, arrangement or undertaking or (iii)
that give any Person the right to receive any economic benefit or right
similar to or derived from the economic benefits and rights occurring to
holders of capital stock or other ownership interests of such Universal
Contributed Interest.

          (b) As of the Closing Date, the Universal Contributed Interests will
not own, directly or indirectly, any Excluded Assets and will not be liable
(after giving effect to the indemnification provisions of Article VII) in
respect of any Excluded Liabilities.

          SECTION 3.16. Brokers or Finders. No agent, broker, investment
banker or other firm or person is or will be entitled to receive from a Parent
Party or its Affiliates or the Partnership any broker's or finder's fee or any

Affiliates, Allen & Co. and Bear, Stearns & Co., whose fees and expenses will
be paid by USAi.

          SECTION 3.17. Investment Intent. Such Parent Party understands that
(i) the interests in the Partnership to be issued to it as contemplated by the
Partnership Agreement have not been, and will not be, registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under any state securities laws, and
are being offered and sold in reliance upon federal and state exemptions for
transactions not involving any public offering, and (ii) to the extent it or
any of its Affiliates acquires any of the interests in the Partnership as
contemplated by the Partnership Agreement, it or such Affiliate will be
acquiring such shares solely for its own account for investment purposes, and
not with a view to the distribution thereof.

          SECTION 3.18. Tax Matters. (a) All material Returns required to be
filed by such Parent Party for taxable periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date by, or with respect to, its Existing Business have been or will
be filed in accordance with all applicable laws, and all Taxes due have been
or will be paid, except where the failure to so file or so pay would not
reasonably be expected to have, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

          (b) USAi represents and warrants that, except as set forth on
Schedule 3.18(b), each entity to be Contributed to the Partnership by USAi or
USANi Sub pursuant to this Agreement and Section 3.01 of the Partnership
Agreement will be treated as a pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax
purposes at the time of contribution.

          SECTION 3.19. Employee Matters. For purposes hereof, "USAi Benefit
Arrangements" shall mean all material employee benefit plans or arrangements
that cover any employee of USAi's Existing Business (the "USAi Business
Employees") including any employment, severance, or other similar contract,
arrangement or policy and each plan or arrangement (written or oral) providing
for insurance coverage (including any self-insured arrangements), workers'
compensation, disability benefits, supplemental unemployment benefits,
vacation benefits, or retirement benefits or for deferred compensation,
profit-sharing, bonuses, stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock
purchases, or other forms of incentive compensation or post-retirement
insurance, compensation, or benefits.

          (b) No USAi Benefit Arrangement is an "employee pension benefit
plan," as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA (an "USAi Pension Plan"), that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and no USAi Benefit
Arrangement provides post-retirement welfare benefits, except as required by
law. Neither USAi nor any of its Affiliates has incurred or expects to incur
any liability or lien under Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code,
which liability or lien would be reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

set forth on Schedule 3.19(c) to be provided within 10 Business Days
hereafter, no USAi Benefit Arrangement or employee benefit plans of any of its
Affiliates or any entity required to be combined with USAi or any of its

plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, and neither USAi nor any of its
Affiliates nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred or expects to incur
any liability or lien with respect to any multiemployer pension plan which
liability or lien would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

          (d) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.19(d), none of USAi, any of
its Affiliates, or any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred, or expects to
incur solely as a result of the consummation of the Transactions (including
any termination of employment in connection therewith), any cost, fee,
expense, liability, claim, suit, obligation, or other damage with respect to
any USAi Pension Plan, or any USAi Benefit Arrangement that could give rise to
the imposition of any liability, cost, fee, expense, or obligation on the
Partnership or any of its Affiliates, which would be reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, and, to USAi's knowledge, no facts or
circumstances exist that could give rise to any such cost, fee, expense,
liability, claim, suit, obligation, or other damage, which would be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.19(d), neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Transactions (including any terminations of employment in
connection therewith) will (i) increase any benefits otherwise payable under
any USAi Benefit Arrangement, which would be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or (ii) result in the acceleration of the time of
payment or vesting of any such payment, which would be reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (e) USAi will deliver or make available to Universal within ten
business days hereafter true and complete copies of each of the following
documents:

               (i) each USAi Benefit Arrangement (and, if applicable, related
          trust agreements) and all amendments thereto, and (if applicable)
          each summary plan description together with any summary of material
          modifications;

               (ii) each written USAi Benefit Arrangement and written
          descriptions thereof that has been distributed to the USAi Business
          Employees (including descriptions of the number and level of
          employees covered thereby); and

               (iii) each employee handbook or similar document describing any
          USAi Benefit Arrangement applicable to the USAi Business Employees.

          (f) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.19(f) to be provided within 10
Business Days hereafter, no controversies, disputes or proceedings are pending
or, to USAi's knowledge, threatened, between USAi or any of its Affiliates,
and any of the USAi Business Employees, which would be reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.19(f) to be
provided within 10 Business Days hereafter, no labor union or other collective
bargaining unit represents or, to USAi's knowledge, claims to represent any
USAi Business Employees and, to USAi's knowledge, there is no union campaign
being conducted to solicit cards from employees to authorize a union to
request a National Labor Relations Board Certification election with respect
to any USAi Business Employees.

          (g) Except where any such failure would not be reasonably expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect, all USAi Benefit Arrangements (i) comply in
all material respects with Applicable Law, including but not limited to ERISA
and the Code, and (ii) have been administered in all material respects in
accordance with their terms, and all required contributions have been made to
such USAi Benefit Arrangements. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.19(g), all
USAi Pension Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code have received a favorable determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service, and USAi has no knowledge of any events that would cause such
letter to be revoked.

          past practice or as required by Applicable Law; or

              (ii) (A) grant to any USAi Business Employee any increase in
          compensation or benefits, except grants in the ordinary course of
          business and consistent with past practice or as may be required
          under agreements in existence on the date of this Agreement or (B)

                                                                            23

          Employee except as may be required under agreements in existence on
          the date of this Agreement.

          (c) Each Parent Party shall promptly advise the other Parent Party

to its Existing Business during normal business hours and upon reasonable
prior notice, (ii) shall furnish to such other Parent Party and its authorized
representatives such financial and operating data and other information
relating to such Existing Business as such other Parent Party may reasonably
request and (iii) shall instruct its employees and representatives to
cooperate with such other Parent Party in its investigation of such Existing
Business, all for the purpose of enabling such other Parent Party and its
authorized representatives to conduct, at their own expense, business and
financial reviews, investigations and studies of such Existing Business. No
investigation pursuant to this Section 4.02 shall affect or otherwise obviate
or diminish any representations or warranties of any Parent Party or
conditions to the obligations of any Parent Party.

          SECTION 4.03. Confidentiality. Each Parent Party acknowledges that

the public other than as a result of a breach of this Section 4.03. The
covenant set forth in this Section 4.03 shall terminate five years after the
date of this Agreement.

          SECTION 4.04. Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) On the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement, each Parent Party and its Affiliates
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Closing to occur as soon as

conditions set forth in Article V), including taking all reasonable actions
necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed
on it or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Closing.

          (b) Subject to Section 2.05, prior to the Closing each Parent Party

Interests and the USANi Distributed Interests to the Partnership pursuant to
Section 2.03(a) and (iii) each Parent Party shall pay one half of the Transfer
Taxes on the distribution by USANi of the USANi Distributed Interests pursuant
to Section 2.02. The Parent Party responsible for paying a Transfer Tax shall
use (and cause its Affiliates to use) its reasonable efforts to avail itself
of any available exemptions from any such Transfer Taxes, and the Parent
Parties shall cooperate with one another in providing any information and
documentation that may be necessary to obtain such exemptions.

          SECTION 4.06. Distribution Agreements. (a) On the earlier to occur
of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) the date on which this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 6.01, the Distribution Agreements shall
terminate (and each Parent Party shall take all efforts necessary to
effectuate the foregoing), and the parties thereto shall have no further
obligations or liabilities thereunder (including under the provisions of each
such agreement relating to (x) distribution obligations after termination or
(y) rights of first negotiation and last refusal after termination), except
with respect to services rendered prior to the date of such termination.

          (b) On the Closing Date, the Ancillary Distribution Agreements shall
terminate (and each Parent Party shall take all efforts necessary to
effectuate the foregoing), and the parties thereto shall have no further
obligations or liabilities thereunder, except with respect to services
rendered prior to the date of such termination.

          (c) Each Parent Party agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, that for a reasonable period of time and not less than one year
following the termination of the Distribution Agreements, it or its Affiliates
will make available to the other Parent Party and its Affiliates (for the
domestic and international distribution of television programming produced by
such Parent Party or its Affiliates), any excess capacity, under existing
output agreements or otherwise, with respect to the domestic and international
distribution of television programming that such Parent Party and its
Affiliates are unable to use for their own programming. In connection with the
termination of the agreements set forth in Section 4.06(a), Universal and USAi
shall cooperate and act in good faith (i) to continue to provide television
distribution, including access to output agreements, for a period of one-year
following the termination date under Section 4.06(a) on terms and conditions
(not including with respect to exclusivity, non-compete and the like)
consistent with past

practice, and (ii) to provide for the orderly wind down of any in-process
commitments or obligations so as not to unreasonably disrupt the Existing
Businesses.

          SECTION 4.07. Publicity. From the date hereof through the Closing
Date, no public release or announcement concerning the Transactions shall be
issued by any party or any of its Affiliates without the prior consent of the
other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as
such release or announcement may be required by law or the rules or
regulations of any United States or foreign securities exchange or commission
(in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall
allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance); provided, however, that a party may
make internal announcements to its and its Affiliates' employees that are
consistent with the parties' prior public disclosures regarding the
Transactions.

          SECTION 4.08. Further Assurances. (a) From time to time prior to and
after the Closing, as and when reasonably requested by another party, each
party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all
such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such
further or other actions (subject to Section 4.04), as such other party may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate the Transactions.

          (b) Universal and its Affiliates and Liberty and its Affiliates
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts (subject to the terms of
the Universal/Liberty Merger Agreement) to cause the conditions to closing set
forth in Sections 6.01, 6.02 and 6.03 of the Universal/Liberty Merger
Agreement to be satisfied as promptly as practicable. Universal and its
Affiliates shall not, without USAi's written consent, terminate the
Universal/Liberty Merger Agreement (other than pursuant to Section 7.01(a)(iv)
thereof) or amend the Universal/Liberty Merger Agreement in any manner that
would (i) delay the consummation of the Transactions in any material respect,
or (ii) increase the consideration payable to Liberty and/or its Affiliates
thereunder, other than in connection with any amendments entered into pursuant
to Section 5.01(d) of the Universal/Liberty Merger Agreement.

          (c) In the event that at any time or from time to time after the
Closing, any Parent Party (or its Affiliates) shall receive or otherwise
possess any Contributed Asset that was not assigned or otherwise transferred
to the Partnership at the Closing, such Parent Party shall promptly


<PAGE>


                                                                            27

use its reasonable best efforts to transfer, or cause to be transferred, such
asset to the Partnership. Prior to any such transfer, the Parent Party (or its
Affiliates) possessing such asset shall hold such asset (and all earnings
generated by such asset from and after the Closing) in trust for the
Partnership.

          SECTION 4.09. Board Recommendation. Neither the USAi Board nor any
committee thereof shall withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Universal,
or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Universal, the
approval or recommendation by the USAi Board or any such committee of this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents to which USAi is a party or the
Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the USAi Stockholder
Approvals, (a) a majority of the Special Committee determines in good faith,
following receipt of the advice of outside counsel, that it is necessary to do
so in order to comply with its fiduciary obligations, the Special Committee
may withdraw or modify its recommendation of this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents to which USAi is a party and the Transactions, and (b) a
majority of the USAi Board determines in good faith, following receipt of the
advice of outside counsel, that it is necessary to do so in order to comply
with its fiduciary obligations, the USAi Board may withdraw or modify its
recommendation to USAi's stockholders of this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents to which USAi is a party and the Transactions; provided that neither
the Special Committee nor the USAi Board may take any action that would result
in USAi's stockholders no longer being legally capable under the DGCL of
approving or authorizing this Agreement or the Transactions.

          SECTION 4.10. Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting.
(a) As soon as practicable after execution of this Agreement, USAi shall
prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary Proxy Statement, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Universal, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to respond, after consultation with Universal, as promptly as
practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. USAi shall notify
Universal promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff
and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement or for additional information. USAi shall supply Universal
with copies of all correspondence between it or its representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
Proxy Statement. Universal shall cooperate with USAi in providing any
information or responses to comments, or other


<PAGE>


                                                                            28

assistance, reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing. If at any
time prior to receipt of the USAi Stockholder Approvals there shall occur any
event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, USAi shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders such an
amendment or supplement. USAi shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as
practicable after filing with the SEC. The Proxy Statement shall comply in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of law. None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by Vivendi, USAi or their respective
Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the proxy statement
will contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading.

          (b) USAi shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its stockholders (the "USAi Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of
seeking the USAi Stockholder Approvals as soon as practicable after the filing
of the definitive Proxy Statement. USAi shall, through the USAi Board,
recommend to its stockholders that they give the USAi Stockholder Approvals,
except to the extent that the USAi Board shall have withdrawn or modified its
recommendation to USAi's stockholders of this Agreement and the Transactions
as permitted by Section 4.09. USAi agrees that its obligations pursuant to
this Section 4.10 shall not be affected by the withdrawal or modification by
the USAi Board or any committee thereof of such Board's or such committee's
recommendation to USAi's stockholders of this Agreement or the Transactions.

          (c) Subject to clause (b) of this Section 4.10, each Parent Party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other Parent Party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain the USAi Stockholder Approvals.

          (d) At any meeting of the stockholders of USAi called to seek the
USAi Stockholder Approvals or in any other circumstances upon which a vote,
consent or other approval (including by written consent) with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions is sought, such Parent Party or Diller, as
applicable, shall vote (or cause to be voted) any USAi Common Stock over which
such Parent Party or Diller, as applicable, has the power to vote in favor of
granting the USAi Stockholder Approvals.

          SECTION 4.11. Commercial Arrangements. (a) Each Parent Party shall
enter into (or cause its Affiliates to enter into) a series of strategic and
commercial alliances with one another covering the transactional and internet
businesses of such Parent Party and its Affiliates on the Closing Date;
provided, that if such alliances are not entered into on or prior to the
Closing Date, the obligations under this provision shall continue after the
Closing Date. The commitment to enter into such agreements is an integral part
of the Transactions and the Parent Parties and their respective Affiliates
shall negotiate in good faith the terms thereof, which shall be mutually
beneficial and on mutually satisfactory terms and designed to treat each
Parent Party and its Affiliates as a "preferred partner" of the other.

          (b) The Parent Parties shall negotiate in good faith to enter into
an agreement on the Closing Date pursuant to which the Partnership will
provide affiliate distribution of the Home Shopping Network, America's Store
and other transactional services (such as a travel network) on an arm's-length
basis; provided, that if such agreement is not entered into on or prior to the
Closing Date, the obligations to provide such affiliate distribution shall
continue after the Closing Date.

          (c) The Parent Parties agree to the arrangements set forth on
Schedule 4.11(c).

          (d) The failure to enter into any of the agreements set forth in
this Section 4.11 prior to the Closing Date will not constitute a failure of
the condition set forth in Section 5.02(b).

          SECTION 4.12. Tax Matters. (a) The Parent Parties intend that the
Partnership be treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax
purposes and agree to take no actions inconsistent with such treatment. The
Parent Parties agree, except as otherwise required pursuant to a final
determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code, to treat the
transactions contemplated by Section 2.02 as a distribution by USANi to
Universal and/or its Affiliates governed by Section 731 of the Code and the
transactions contemplated by Sections 2.03 as a contribution of property to the
Partnership governed by Section 721(a) of the Code and a distribution by the
Partnership to USANi Sub, in each case that will not result in recognition of
gain or loss by any Parent Party or any of their respective Affiliates under any

          (b) To the extent any entity to be Contributed to the Partnership by
Universal pursuant to this Agreement and Section 3.01 of the Partnership
Agreement is treated as other than a pass-through entity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, Universal shall take all reasonable actions necessary to
cause such entity (or its successor) to be treated as a pass-through entity
for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a "Conversion"), provided that Universal
has determined in good faith that (i) neither Universal nor any of its
Affiliates shall suffer a material tax detriment or any other material cost as
a result of such Conversion and (ii) such Conversion is not prohibited by
applicable contract or law.

          (c) Subject to Universal delivering to USAi a schedule setting forth
Universal's (or any of its Affiliate's) adjusted tax basis in any assets that
were contributed to USANi or any of its subsidiaries by Universal (or any of
its Affiliates) in a transaction in which USANi or any of its subsidiaries
took a transferred basis, USAi will deliver to Universal no later than 30 days
prior to the Closing Date a schedule setting forth to USAi's best knowledge
USANi Sub's tax basis, immediately after the Effective Time, in its interest
in the Partnership.

          (d) No later than 30 days prior to the Closing Date, USAi shall
deliver to Universal a schedule setting forth, to the best knowledge of USAi,
the adjusted tax basis of USAi or USANi Sub, as the case may be, in each of
the assets to be contributed by USAi or USANi Sub, as the case may be, to the
Partnership.

          SECTION 4.13. Agreement Not To Compete. (a) USAi understands that
the Partnership shall be entitled to protect and preserve the going concern
value of USAi's Existing Business to the extent permitted by law and that
Universal would not have entered into this Agreement absent the provisions of
this Section 4.13 and, therefore, for a period from the Closing Date until the
date that is the later of (1) 18 months after the Closing Date and (2) six
calendar months after the date upon which Diller ceases to be the CEO of the
Partnership, USAi shall not, and shall cause each of its controlled Affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly:

               (i) engage in the Business or acquire any interest in any
          Person engaged in the Business; and

              (ii)(A) solicit, recruit or hire any employees of any Existing
          Business or the Partnership or Persons who have worked for any
          Existing Business or the


<PAGE>


                                                                            31

          Partnership, in each case other than employees who perform solely
          clerical functions for such Persons, (B) solicit or encourage any
          employee of any Existing Business or the Partnership to leave the
          employment of any Existing Business or the Partnership, in each case
          other than employees who perform solely clerical functions for such
          Persons, and (C) disclose or furnish to anyone any confidential
          information relating to its Existing Business or the Partnership or
          otherwise use such confidential information for its own benefit or
          the benefit of any other Person; provided that the non- solicitation
          provisions of clauses (A) and (B) shall be deemed not breached by
          any advertisement or general solicitation that is not specifically
          targeted at the employees or Persons referred to therein;

provided, further, that if at any time after 18 months after the Closing Date
(x) Diller shall cease to be the CEO or an officer of USAi or any of its
Affiliates but shall still be the CEO of the Partnership, or (y) Diller
resigns as CEO of the Partnership for Good Reason or is terminated without
Cause (each, as defined in the Partnership Agreement), then the restrictions
set forth in this Section 4.13(a) shall cease to apply. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, USAi agrees that it shall not restructure, reorganize or take any
other action in an effort to circumvent the terms or intent of this Section
4.13(a).

          (b) Section 4.13(a) shall be deemed not breached as a result of the
ownership by USAi or any of its Affiliates of: (i) interests in the
Partnership, (ii) less than an aggregate of 5% of any class of stock of a
Person engaged, directly or indirectly, in the Business; provided, however,
that such stock is listed on a national securities exchange, (iii) Vivendi
ordinary shares as the result of the exercise of a put or a call under Section
10.03 of the Partnership Agreement, (iv) less than 10% in value of any
instrument of indebtedness of a Person engaged, directly or indirectly, in the
Business, and (v) the whole or any part of an acquired Person or business
which carries on the Business, where less than 30% of such Person's revenues
are generated by the Business, and USAi or its Affiliates will dispose of such
Business within six months of its acquisition, provided that such disposition
may be delayed pending receipt of required regulatory approvals.

          (c) USAi agrees that this covenant is reasonable with respect to its
duration and scope. If, at the time of enforcement of this Section 4.13, a
court holds that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under the
circumstances then existing, the parties hereto agree that


<PAGE>


                                                                            32

the period and scope legally permissible under such circumstances will be
substituted for the period and scope stated herein.

          SECTION 4.14. USAi Partnership Interests. USAi covenants and agrees
that at all times its interests in the Partnership shall be held directly by
USAi or by a wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary of USAi, provided,
however, that this covenant shall not be deemed to be breached solely as a
result of the fact that Home Shopping Network, Inc. is not a wholly owned
subsidiary of USAi, so long as Liberty and USAi remain the only shareholders
of Home Shopping Network, Inc. and Liberty's ownership percentage of Home
Shopping Network, Inc. does not increase materially.

          SECTION 4.15. Officers of the Partnership. Universal shall cause
Diller to be appointed as the CEO and Chairman of the Partnership, as
contemplated by the Partnership Agreement.

          SECTION 4.16. Partnership Agreement Obligations. Vivendi shall
comply with the terms of Section 10.03 of the Partnership Agreement and
Universal shall comply with the terms of Sections 8.07 and 10.03 of the
Partnership Agreement, in each case, as if it were a party to such agreement.
Vivendi shall cause the general partner of the Partnership to perform all of
its obligations as the general partner under the Partnership Agreement.

          SECTION 4.17. Committed LLC Shares; Committed Common Equity. (a)
Between the date hereof and the Closing, Universal shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Affiliates to, sell, transfer, pledge, encumber, assign or
otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option or other arrangement
or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge, encumbrance,
assignment or other disposition of, the Committed LLC Shares. Any transfer of
Committed LLC Shares not permitted hereby shall be null and void.

          (b) Following the Closing and until such time that the obligations
in Section 8.07 of the Partnership Agreement are satisfied, Universal and its
Affiliates shall at all times retain at least 43,181,308 shares of USAi Common
Stock and 13,430,000 shares of USAi Class B Common Stock (as adjusted for
stock splits and the like, together, the "Committed Common Equity"), in each
case, free of any Liens, except Permitted Liens. To the extent that some, but
not all, of the Committed Common Equity is required to satisfy Universal's
obligations under the Partnership Agreement,


<PAGE>


                                                                            33

Universal and its Affiliates shall satisfy such obligations, first out of USAi
Class B Common Stock, and second out of USAi Common Stock.

          SECTION 4.18. Partnership. (a) Universal shall ensure that the
Partnership, when formed, is formed as a Delaware limited liability limited
partnership, is formed for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions and for
the other purposes set forth in the Partnership Agreement, and, following its
formation through to the Closing, does not engage in any business activities
or incur any liabilities, other than as specifically contemplated by the
Transactions.

          (b) Universal shall from time to time, directly or indirectly,
contribute sufficient equity to the Partnership to ensure the Partnership is
able to perform all of its obligations under Sections 8.01, 8.02 and 8.06 of
the Partnership Agreement.

          SECTION 4.19. Substitute Letters of Credit; Guarantees. As promptly
as practicable following the date hereof, USAi shall provide to Universal a
list of letters of credit, guarantees and any similar obligations of USAi and
its Affiliates (other than the Contributed Subsidiaries) primarily related to
USAi's Existing Business and not constituting Excluded Liabilities. Effective
as of the Closing, Universal shall cause the Partnership or one of its
Affiliates to procure substitute letters of credit, and shall cause the
Partnership or one of its Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for any
of USAi or its Affiliates (other than the Contributed Subsidiaries) with
respect to any such matters.

          SECTION 4.20. USANi Tax Distribution. A distribution (as calculated
pursuant to Section 8.2 of the USANi LLC Agreement) shall be made by USANi to
each Liberty Party that holds an interest in USANi prior to the exchanges of
USANi Shares for Shares of USAI Common Stock contemplated by Section 2.01 of
the Universal/Liberty Merger Agreement (the "Tax Distribution"), and the
proceeds of such Tax Distribution shall be distributed by such Liberty Party
to its shareholder, immediately prior to any Merger involving such Liberty
Party. The amount of such Tax Distribution shall be calculated in the good
faith judgment of USANi based on facts known as of the date of such Tax
Distribution and such Tax Distribution shall be made with respect to any
taxable period (or portion thereof) of USANi (up to and including the Closing
Date) and such determination shall be final and binding upon the parties. For
purposes of this Section 4.20, "Liberty Party" and "Merger" shall have the

                                                                            34

meanings assigned to such terms by the Universal/Liberty Merger Agreement.

          SECTION 4.21. Lease Arrangement. For a reasonable transition period
of up to two years following the Closing (but in no event later than the date
that executives of USAi's Existing Business as of the date hereof cease to
occupy such premises), the Partnership shall be entitled to occupy the
premises located at 8800 Sunset Boulevard, West Hollywood, California, on a
rent-free basis.

          SECTION 4.22. USA Name. The Parent Parties acknowledge that the USA
Name shall be Contributed to the Partnership as of the Closing Date. Prior to
the Closing the Parent Parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine how
the ownership of the various logos and designs currently associated with the
USA Name ("Associated IP") shall be allocated, it being understood that (A)
USAi shall be granted a perpetual, non-exclusive royalty-free license to use
the USA Name in connection with its other businesses and (B) whichever Parent
Party is allocated ownership of a particular piece of Associated IP will grant
to the other Parent Party the right to use such Associated IP consistently
with current practice and without any significant economic cost to the
grantee. The Parent Parties shall work cooperatively to provide for an orderly
transition and to minimize confusion resulting from the use of the USA Name by
the Partnership and USAi.

          SECTION 4.23. Options and Restricted Stock. Vivendi shall use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that each USAi Business Employee, who holds
stock options to acquire USAi Common Stock, whether vested or unvested, in-
the-money or underwater (the "USAi Options") and/or USAi restricted Common
Stock awards (the "USAi Restricted Stock", collectively with the USAi Options,
the "USAi Equity Awards"), shall be awarded, as of the Closing Date (or, if
the date of forfeiture of the USAi Option is 90 days or more following the
Closing Date, as soon as reasonably practicable following the applicable
forfeiture date), subject to the forfeiture of any USAi Equity Award, stock
options, restricted stock or other equity-based compensation in respect of
Vivendi American Depositary Shares representing Vivendi ordinary shares par
value Euro 5.50 per share (the "ADSs") that have a "value" that is at least
equal to the "value" of the forfeited USAi Equity Awards (the "Vivendi
Replacement Awards"). The Vivendi Replacement Awards shall at a minimum (a)
preserve the intrinsic value (i.e., the "spread") of the USAi Options that are
in-the- money (relative to the fair market value of the ADSs underlying the
Vivendi Replacement Awards) and the fair

                                                                            35

market value of the USAi Restricted Stock and (b) with respect to USAi Options
that are underwater, have an exercise price such that the Vivendi Replacement
Awards are not underwater by a greater percentage of fair market value than
the underwater USAi Options, in all cases measured as of the date of grant of
the Vivendi Replacement Awards. USAi represents that the maximum number of
shares of USAi Restricted Stock held by USAi Business Employees that will be
required to be replaced with Vivendi Replacement Awards is 57,500 shares of
USAi Common Stock.

conditions of each party may be waived by such party to the extent permitted
by law:

          (a) Other than such Consents, registrations, declarations or filings
the failure of which to obtain would not have a Material Adverse Effect, all
Consents of, or registrations, declarations or filings with, or expirations of
waiting periods imposed by, any Governmental Entity necessary for the
consummation of the Transactions shall have been obtained or filed or shall
have occurred.

          (b) No Applicable Law or Judgment enacted, entered, promulgated,
enforced or issued by any Governmental Entity or other legal restraint or
prohibition preventing the consummation of the Transactions shall be in

entitled to waive the satisfaction of the foregoing condition without the
prior written approval of Liberty.

          SECTION 5.02. Additional Conditions to Obligation of each Parent
Party. The obligation of each Parent Party to consummate the Transactions is
further subject to the satisfaction on the Closing Date of the following
conditions, any one or more of which conditions of such Parent Party may be
waived by such party to the extent permitted by law:

          (a) Except to the extent that the failure of such representations
and warranties to be true and correct, in the aggregate, would not (after
giving effect to the operation of Section 2.05) have a Material Adverse
Effect: the representations and warranties of the other Parent Party made in
this Agreement, without regard to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect
qualification, shall be true and correct as of the date hereof and, in the
case of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.01, 3.02,
3.03 (only with respect to the Organizational Documents of such Parent Party),
3.05, 3.08 and 3.15, as of the Effective Time, except to the extent such
representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date (in which
case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct as of such
earlier date), and such Parent Party shall have received a certificate signed
by an executive officer of the other Parent Party to such effect.

          (b) The other Parent Party and its Affiliates shall have performed
or complied in all material respects with all obligations and covenants
required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by such other
Parent Party or such Affiliates by the Effective Time, and such Parent Party
shall have received a certificate signed by an authorized officer of such
other Parent Party to such effect.

          SECTION 5.03. Frustration of Closing Conditions. No Parent Party may
rely on the failure of any condition set forth in this Article V to be
satisfied if such failure was caused by (i) the action or willful inaction of
such party or its Affiliates, (ii) the failure of any representation or
warranty of such party qualified as to materiality to be true and correct or,
those not so qualified to be true and correct in all material respects, or
(iii) failure to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Closing to occur
as required by Section 4.04.

                                  Termination

          SECTION 6.01. Termination. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated and the other
Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before
or after the USAi Stockholder Approvals are obtained:

               (i) by mutual written consent of the parties hereto;

              (ii) by either Parent Party if, upon a vote at a duly held USAi
          Stockholder Meeting or any adjournment thereof, the USAi Stockholder
          Approvals shall not have been obtained;

             (iii) by either Parent Party if any of the conditions to such
          Parent Party's obligations set forth in Article V shall have become
          incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been waived by such
          Parent Party;

              (iv) by Universal if the USAi Board or any committee thereof
          shall have withdrawn or modified its approval or recommendation of
          this Agreement or the Transactions; or

               (v) by any party hereto, if the Closing does not occur on or
          prior to September 30, 2002;

provided, however, that the party seeking termination pursuant to clause (ii),
(iii) or (v) is not in breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement in any material respect.

          (b) In the event of termination by a party pursuant to this Section
6.01, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other parties,

Transactions, whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof.

          SECTION 6.02. Effect of Termination. (a) If this Agreement is
terminated and the Transactions are abandoned as described in Section 6.01,
this Agreement shall

become null and void and of no further force and effect, except for the

Section 4.03 relating to the obligation of the Parent Parties to keep

parties, (iii) Section 4.05 relating to certain expenses, (iv) Section 4.07
relating to publicity, and (v) Section 6.01 and this Section 6.02 relating to
termination. Nothing in this Section 6.02 shall be deemed to release any party
from any liability for any breach by such party of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement.

          (b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.01(a)(iv),
then USAi shall promptly reimburse Universal and its Affiliates for all of
their documented, out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, up to a limit of $15,000,000.
Such reimbursement shall be paid upon demand following such termination.

          (b) In addition, Vivendi shall be liable for, and shall indemnify
and hold harmless USAi and its Affiliates from and against any Tax Detriment
incurred by USAi or any of its Affiliates solely as a result of (i) the breach
by Universal or any of its Affiliates of any of the covenants set forth in
Sections 2.07, 3.01(c), 5.05(a)(i), 5.05(a)(v) or 5.05(a)(vi) of the
Partnership Agreement or (ii) if Vivendi has elected that any covenant set
forth in Section 5.05(b) of the Partnership Agreement shall not apply, any
action or inaction that would constitute a breach of such covenant.

          (c) USAi shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Universal, the Partnership and their respective Affiliates from and against,
the following Taxes:

               (i) any and all Taxes with respect to its Existing Business
          (other than Taxes attributable to the ownership of USANi Shares by
          Universal or any of its Affiliates) for any taxable period beginning
          on or after February 13, 1998 (in the case of Taxes relating

                                                                            41

          to USA Cable, Studios USA or their respective subsidiaries) and
          May 29, 1999 (in the case of Taxes relating to USA Films or its
          subsidiaries) and ending (or deemed pursuant to Section 7.02(c) to
          end) on or before the Closing Date; and

              (ii) any several liability under Treasury Regulation Section
          1.1502-6 or under any comparable or similar provision under state,
          local or foreign laws or regulations for periods beginning on or
          after February 13, 1998 (in the case of Taxes relating to USA Cable,
          Studios USA or their respective subsidiaries) and May 29, 1999 (in
          the case of Taxes relating to USA Films or its subsidiaries) and
          ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

          (d) In addition, USAi shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and
hold harmless Universal and its Affiliates from and against any Tax Detriment
incurred by Universal or any of its Affiliates solely as a result of the
breach by USAi or any of its Affiliates of any covenant set forth in Section
2.07 or 3.01(c) of the Partnership Agreement.

               (e) (i) The Parent Parties agree that if any entity transferred
          to the Partnership is permitted but not required under applicable
          foreign, state or local Income Tax laws to treat the day before the
          Closing Date or the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable
          period, such day shall be treated as the last day of a taxable
          period.

              (ii) For purposes hereof, in the case of any Taxes that are
          imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a period that begins
          before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date, the portion
          of such Tax that shall be deemed to be payable for the portion of
          the period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any
          Taxes, other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts,
          be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or,
          in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount
          of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period), whether
          actually paid before, during, or after such period, multiplied by a
          fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in
          the period ending on (and including) the Closing Date and the
          denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
          period, and (ii) in the case of any Taxes based upon or related to
          income or receipts (including but not limited to withholding Taxes),
          be deemed equal


<PAGE>


                                                                            42

          to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended on
          the close of business on the Closing Date. Any credits for such a
          period shall be prorated, based upon the fraction employed in clause
          (i) of the preceding sentence. Such clause (i) shall be applied with
          respect to Taxes for such period relating to capital (including net
          worth or long-term debt) or intangibles by reference to the level of
          such items on the Closing Date. Principles similar to those of this
          Section 7.02(c)(ii) shall be applied in determining whether a Tax is
          for a taxable period beginning on or after February 13, 1998 or
          May 29, 1999, as applicable.

          SECTION 7.03. Refunds. (a) Universal and its Affiliates shall be
entitled to any refunds or credits of Taxes attributable to or arising in
taxable periods ending (or deemed pursuant to Section 7.02(c) to end) on or
before the Closing Date with respect to its Existing Business or its ownership
of the USANi Shares, as the case may be.

          (b) USAi and its Affiliates shall be entitled to any refunds or
credits of Taxes attributable to or arising in taxable periods ending (or
deemed pursuant to Section 7.02(c) to end) on or before the Closing Date with
respect to its Existing Business (other than with respect to the USANi Shares
owned by Universal or any of its Affiliates).

          SECTION 7.04. Calculation of Losses. The amount of any Loss, Tax, or
Tax Detriment for which indemnification is provided under this Article VII
shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the indemnified party (as
defined in Section 7.06(a)) under insurance policies or indemnities from third
parties with respect to such Loss, Tax, or Tax Detriment and shall be (i)
increased to take account of any net Tax cost incurred by the indemnified
party arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for
such increase) and (ii) reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit
realized by the indemnified party arising from the incurrence or payment of
any such Loss, Tax or Tax Detriment. In computing the amount of any such Tax
cost or Tax benefit, the indemnified party shall be deemed to fully utilize,
at the highest marginal Tax rate then in effect, all Tax items arising from
the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of
any indemnified Loss, Tax or Tax Detriment.

          SECTION 7.05. Termination of Indemnification. The obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless any party (i) pursuant to Section 7.01(a)(i) or
7.01(b)(i), as the


<PAGE>


                                                                            43

case may be, shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty
terminates pursuant to Section 7.07, (ii) pursuant to Section 7.02, shall
terminate when the applicable statute of limitations expires (giving effect to
any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof) and (iii) pursuant to the other
clauses of Sections 7.01, shall not terminate; provided, however, that such
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to
any item as to which the Person to be indemnified shall have, before the
expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a
notice of such claim (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim)
pursuant to Section 7.06 to the party to be providing the indemnification.

          SECTION 7.06. Procedures; Exclusivity. (a) In order for a party (the
"indemnified party") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under
this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any
Person against the indemnified party (a "Third Party Claim"), such indemnified
party must notify the indemnifying party in writing (and in reasonable detail)
of the Third Party Claim promptly following receipt by such indemnified party
of written notice of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to
give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder
except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the indemnified party
shall deliver to the indemnifying party, promptly after the indemnified
party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim.

          (b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the indemnifying party; provided, however, that such counsel is not reasonably
objected to by the indemnified party. Should the indemnifying party so elect
to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not
be liable to the indemnified party for any legal expenses incurred from and
after the date of such assumption by the indemnified party in connection with
the defense thereof. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the
indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party
shall control such defense. The indemnifying party shall be


<PAGE>


                                                                            44

liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party
for any period during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense
thereof. If the indemnifying party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third
Party Claim, all the indemnified parties shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the indemnifying party's request and at its expense) the provision to the
indemnifying party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to
such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Whether or not the indemnifying party assumes the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third
Party Claim without the indemnifying party's prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). If the indemnifying party assumes
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall agree to any
settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that the
indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the
indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Third Party Claim (or, in the case of any Third Party Claim with respect
to Taxes, as to which the indemnifying party acknowledges in writing its
obligation to make payment in full), that releases the indemnified party
completely in connection with such Third Party Claim (or, in the case of any
Third Party Claim with respect to Taxes, as to which the indemnifying party
acknowledges in writing its obligation to make payment in full) and that would
not otherwise materially and adversely affect the indemnified party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (and shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the indemnified party in
defending such Third Party Claim) if the Third Party Claim seeks an order,
injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages
against the indemnified party that the indemnified party reasonably
determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated
from any related claim for money damages.

          (c) In the event any indemnified party should have a claim against
any indemnifying party under this Article VII that does not involve a Third
Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such
indemnified party, the indemnified party shall deliver notice of such claim
with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party. So long as the
indemnified party

                                                                            45

provides notification to the indemnifying party prior to the termination of
the obligation to indemnify as set forth in Section 7.05, the failure by any
indemnified party so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the
indemnifying party from any liability that it may have to such indemnified
party under this Article VII, except to the extent that the indemnifying party
demonstrates that it has been actually prejudiced by such failure. The
indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of any dispute with respect to such a claim and, if not
resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in
an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction.

          (d) After the Closing, Section 7.01 shall constitute the exclusive
remedy for any misrepresentation or breach of warranty contained in this
Agreement.

          SECTION 7.07. Survival. The representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in the Transaction Documents or in any certificates
delivered pursuant to Section 5.02(a) shall survive the Closing and shall
terminate on March 31, 2003, except for those contained in Section 3.18, which
shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extensions thereof).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, those covenants or agreements that contemplate
or may involve actions to be taken or obligations in effect after the Closing
shall survive in accordance with their terms.


                                 ARTICLE VIII

                                 Miscellaneous

          SECTION 8.01. Approval of Transactions. By execution of this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto approves and consents, in each case on
its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, to the Transactions (including
in respect of any transaction to be taken after the Closing in respect of USAi
Shares under Section 8.07 of the Partnership Agreement) and the actions
necessary to be taken by USAi, USANi and their respective Affiliates in
connection therewith, for all purposes under the Investment Agreement, the
Governance Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement and the USANi LLC Agreement
and all other agreements to which it or its Affiliates is a party that
provides the right to consent to USAi's entering into the Transactions. Each
of Diller, Universal and Liberty hereby waives any right of first refusal or
tag along right and any restriction on Transfer

                                                                            46

(as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) relating to the Transactions;
provided that (x) Liberty will be entitled to exercise its preemptive rights
in accordance with the Governance Agreement with respect to the Warrants to be
issued to Universal pursuant to this Agreement and (y) nothing herein shall be
deemed to constitute a waiver or consent of Diller or Liberty of his or its
rights under the Stockholders Agreement or the Governance Agreement with
respect to transactions relating to Transfers of USAi Shares occurring after
the Closing Date (other than delivery by Universal or its Affiliates of USAi
Shares in accordance with Section 8.07 of the Partnership Agreement).

          SECTION 8.02. Notices. All notices, requests and other
communications to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing
(including a facsimile or similar writing) and shall be given to a party
hereto at the address or facsimile number set forth for such party on Schedule
8.02 or as such party shall at any time otherwise specify by notice to each of
the other parties to such agreement or instrument. Each such notice, request
or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile, at the
time such facsimile is transmitted and the appropriate confirmation is
received (or, if such time is not during a Business Day, at the beginning of
the next such Business Day), (ii) if given by mail, five Business Days (or, if
to an address outside the United States, ten calendar days) after such
communication is deposited in the United States mails with first-class postage
prepaid, addressed as aforesaid, or (iii) if given by any other means, when
delivered at the address specified pursuant hereto.

          SECTION 8.03. No Third Party Beneficiaries. The terms of this
Agreement are not intended to confer any rights or remedies hereunder upon,
and shall not be enforceable by, any Person other than the parties hereto,
other than (i) with respect to the provisions of Article VII hereof, each
indemnified person and (ii) with respect to Section 4.13, the Partnership.

          SECTION 8.04. Waiver. No failure by any party to this Agreement to
insist upon the strict performance of any covenant, agreement, term or
condition hereof or to exercise any right or remedy consequent upon a breach
of such or any other covenant, agreement, term or condition shall operate as a
waiver of such or any other covenant, agreement, term or condition of this
Agreement. Any party to this Agreement, by notice given in accordance with
Section 8.02, may, but shall not be under any obligation to, waive any of its
rights or conditions to its obligations under this Agreement, or any duty,
obligation or covenant of any other

                                                                            47

party hereto. No waiver shall affect or alter the remainder of this Agreement
and each and every covenant, agreement, term and condition hereof shall
continue in full force and effect with respect to any other then existing or
subsequent breach. Subject to Section 7.06(d), the rights and remedies
provided by this Agreement are cumulative and the exercise of any one right or
remedy by any party shall not preclude or waive its right to exercise any or
all other rights or remedies.

          SECTION 8.05. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

          SECTION 8.06. Integration. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents (including the schedules and exhibits hereto and thereto) constitute
the entire agreement among the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings of the parties in
connection herewith, and no covenant, representation or condition not
expressed in such Transaction Documents shall affect, or be effective to
interpret, change or restrict, the express provisions of this Agreement.

          SECTION 8.07. Headings. The titles of Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be interpreted to limit or
otherwise affect the provisions of this Agreement.

          SECTION 8.08. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the
parties hereto in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original and all of which, taken together, shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

          SECTION 8.09. Severability. Each provision of this Agreement shall
be considered separable and if for any reason any provision or provisions
hereof are determined to be invalid and contrary to any applicable law, such
invalidity shall not impair the operation of or affect those portions of this
Agreement which are valid.

          SECTION 8.10. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to the conflicts of law principles thereof.

                                                                            48

          SECTION 8.11. Jurisdiction. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably
submits to the jurisdiction of (i) the courts of the State of Delaware, New
Castle County, and (ii) the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware, for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding (other than
suits, actions or other proceedings arising solely out of the
Universal/Liberty Merger Agreement) arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions. Each party agrees to commence any such action, suit or
proceeding either in the courts of the State of Delaware, New Castle County or
if such suit, action or other proceeding may not be brought in such court for
jurisdictional reasons, in the District Court for the District of Delaware.
Each party further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document by U.S. registered mail to such party's respective address in
accordance with Section 8.02 shall be effective service of process for any
action, suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to which it
has submitted to jurisdiction in this Section 8.11. Each party irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions in (i)
the courts of the State of Delaware, New Castle, or (ii) the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably
and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.

          SECTION 8.12. Specific Performance. Each of the parties to this
Agreement agrees that the other parties hereto would be irreparably damaged if
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
its specific terms and that monetary damages would not provide an adequate
remedy in such event. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedy to which
the nonbreaching parties may be entitled, at law or in equity, the
nonbreaching parties (or the Partnership, in the case of Section 4.13) may be
entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof.

          SECTION 8.13. Amendments. This Agreement may be amended by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto at any
time before or after receipt of the USAi Stockholder Approvals, provided,
however, that after any such approval, there shall be made no amendment that
by law requires further approval by such stockholders without the further
approval of such stockholders.
