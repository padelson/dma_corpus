pending or, to the Sellers Knowledge, threatened against any of the Sites or

Facilities (which are addressed in _Section 4.4_ ), the Sellers have good
title to the Assets, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.
Except for (1) the portion of the LOU Facility that is currently under repair

Agreement occurs notwithstanding the failure to obtain any Required Consent,
Transfer License, Transferable License or New License or any other consent
then:

        

(i) nothing set forth in this Agreement, nor any Seller Ancillary Document,
will constitute an assignment, transfer, sublease, or sublicense of any
Assumed Contract, Existing Easement or License (including any Environmental
Permit or any pending application for any License or Environmental Permit)
that requires the consent of the other party thereto or any other third party
(including any Governmental Entity) (each such Asset, a " _Restricted Asset_
");

  

(ii) the Sellers or their Affiliate shall retain such Restricted Asset;

  

(iii) if such Restricted Asset is a Transfer License, Transferable License or
New License, then to the extent permitted under the terms thereof, the
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Purchaser or
its Affiliate with the benefits of such Restricted Asset, including (if
applicable) sublicensing such Restricted Asset to the Purchaser or its
Affiliate;

  

(iv) if such Restricted Asset is an Assumed Contract or any Existing Easement
(other than a Special Restricted Asset or an Existing Easement addressed in
_Section 6.5(b)_ ), the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide the Purchaser or its Affiliate with the benefits of such Restricted
Asset, including (if applicable) subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing
to the Purchaser or its Affiliate, and shall enforce and perform, at the
request and expense of the Purchaser and for the benefit of the Purchaser or
its Affiliate, any and all rights of the Sellers or their Affiliate against a
third party thereto; and

  

(v) if such Restricted Asset is set forth on _Schedule 6.5(a)(v)_ (each such
asset, a " _Special Restricted Asset_ "), the Sellers shall, to the extent
not in violation of applicable Law, provide the Purchaser or its Affiliate
with the benefits of such Special Restricted Asset, including subcontracting,
sublicensing or subleasing to the Purchaser or its Affiliate, and shall
enforce and perform, at the request and expense of the Purchaser and for the
benefit of the Purchaser or its Affiliate, any and all rights of the Sellers
or their Affiliate against a third party thereto.

  

In connection with the foregoing, (A) the Purchaser or its Affiliate shall
promptly pay the Sellers or their Affiliates costs of satisfying
any obligations and responsibilities accruing under such Restricted Asset
that the Purchaser or its Affiliate would have otherwise incurred if the
Required Consents had been obtained, and (B) with respect to any Assumed
Contract that is a Restricted Asset, the Sellers shall promptly pay to the
Purchaser or its Affiliate when received all monies received by the Sellers
or their Affiliates in connection with such Restricted Asset or any claim or
right or any benefit arising thereunder.

  

(b) With respect to any of the Easement Facilities ( _i.e._ , any pipeline
or other facility), if, under the terms of any of the Existing Easements
related to such Easement Facility consent is required prior to the assignment
of such Existing Easement to the Purchaser and such consent has not been
obtained prior to Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement
to convey at the Closing such Existing Easement or the

        

portions of such Easement Facility that are located upon or related to such
Existing Easement.  In such case, the Parties agree that with respect to the
portions of each Easement Facility not conveyed at the Closing, the Parties
shall enter into a capacity rights purchase agreement substantially in the
form of _Exhibit F_ (the " _Capacity Rights Purchase Agreement_ ") for the
portion of the Easement Facility and the related portion of the Existing
Easement for which such consent is required and that the other portions of
such Easement Facility and the related Existing Easement shall be conveyed to
the Purchaser at the Closing. Pursuant to any such Capacity Rights Purchase
Agreement, the Purchaser shall have all capacity rights and the Purchaser
shall have all operational responsibility and shall bear all ownership,
operation, maintenance and other costs and risks of such Easement Facility
and, to the extent related to such Easement Facility, the related Existing
Easements and the use thereof, and shall defend and indemnify the Seller
Indemnified Parties against all such costs and risks (other than
those resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Sellers). The Purchaser shall make all filings necessary to be named the
operator of all the Easement Facilities and to obtain and hold all Licenses
relating to the Easement Facilities. With respect to any Easement Facility
and related Existing Easements to which the Capacity Rights Purchase
Agreement applies, when the applicable consents are obtained, the Sellers
shall convey such Easement Facility and assign such Existing Easements to the
Purchaser within ten days following receipt of such consents, and the
Capacity Rights Purchase Agreement with respect to such Easement Facility
shall terminate. During the term of any such Capacity Rights Purchase
Agreement, the Sellers shall not convey, or allow any Liens by, through, or
under the Sellers to attach to, the applicable Easement Facility or Easements
covered by such Capacity Rights Purchase Agreement. Additionally, the
Purchaser may terminate such Capacity Rights Purchase Agreement at any time
by giving sixty (60) days notice. At the time of termination of the
Capacity Rights Purchase Agreement, the applicable Sellers shall convey
and shall cause their Affiliates to convey to the Purchaser or its
nominee, directly or indirectly, without warranty, the remaining rights they
may have in the Easement Facilities and, to the extent related to such
Easement Facilities, the Existing Easements. At the Purchasers request, the
Sellers and the Purchaser shall jointly evaluate the permissibility of (i)
transferring to a newly formed special purpose corporation or
limited liability company (the " _Easement SPV_ "), any of the easements that
are subject to the Capacity Rights Agreement; (ii) having the Purchaser
purchase all of the equity interest in the Easement SPV for the payment of
$1.00; and (iii) terminating the Capacity Rights Agreement with respect to
the easements owned by the Easement SPV. If the Parties determine that the
terms of any of the easements that are subject to the Capacity Rights
Agreement permit such an arrangement, at Purchasers request, the Parties
will implement such arrangements with respect to such easements on terms to
be reasonably agreed to by the Parties.

  

(c) The Sellers shall continue after the Closing to use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any Required Consent, Transfer License,
Transferable License or any other consent that was not obtained prior to the
Closing. During the term of the Capacity Rights Purchase Agreement, with
respect to any Easements and Easement Facilities covered thereby, the
Purchaser shall not take any action to obtain any Required Consents without
the prior written consent of the Sellers.

        

Section 6.6 _Public Announcements_. The Parties shall not issue any press
release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereunder without obtaining the prior written
approval of the other Party hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, unless, in the sole judgment of the Purchaser or the
Sellers, as applicable, disclosure is otherwise required by (i) applicable
Law, or (ii) by the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which the
Purchaser or the Sellers lists securities, provided, that to the extent
required by applicable Law, the Party intending to make such release shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with such applicable Law
to (a) consult in good faith with the other Party with respect to the timing
and content thereof (including giving due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith) and (b)
provide a copy thereof to the other Party prior to such issuance.

  

Section 6.7 _Employees_.

  

(a) _Transferred Employees_. The Purchaser shall offer employment to each
Business Employee set forth on _Schedule 6.7(a)-1_. The Purchaser shall have
the option to offer employment to each Business Employee set forth on
_Schedule 6.7(a)-2_. Business Employees who accept such offers are, as of the
Closing Date, referred to herein as " _Transferred Employees_." Subject to the
provisions of any Labor Agreements, for a period of at least 12 months after
the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide each Transferred Employee with
base wages and/or salaries not less than those in effect immediately prior to
the Closing Date and with benefits that are not less than those provided to
similarly situated employees of the Purchaser.

  

(b) _Employee Communications_. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall share
with the Purchaser any written communication the Sellers intend to distribute
to a group of Business Employees regarding the transaction contemplated in
this Agreement.  The Sellers shall share these written communications with
the Purchaser as soon as practicable before distribution to the Business
Employees, and with sufficient time for the Purchaser to raise any issues it
may have with the communication prior to distribution.  Also, prior to the
Closing, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall cooperate with one another in
facilitating an orderly process for those Business Employees accepting offers
of employment from the Purchaser so that their employment with the Purchaser
will be effective as of the Effective Time if the Closing occurs. From the
date of this Agreement until the Closing, the Sellers shall afford the
Purchaser with reasonable access to the Business Employees in order to make
and finalize its offers of employment; _provided, however_ , that any such
access or availability shall be provided during normal business hours upon
reasonable advance notice to the Sellers, and in such a manner as to not
unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Sellers.

  

(c) _Seller Benefit Plans_. The Sellers shall retain, and the Purchaser shall
have no liability with respect to, the Seller Benefit Plans.

  

(d) _Severance_. The Purchaser shall establish and maintain for a period of
not less than 12 months from the Closing Date (for the benefit of the
Transferred Employees), a severance program providing to
Transferred Employees who leave the employ of the Purchaser and its
Affiliates at any time during the 12-month period after

        

the Closing for any reason other than through death, disability, discharge
for cause (including, but not limited to, negative results on a drug test or
background check administered after the Closing) or the employees voluntary
act, severance benefits that are at least equal to those provided under the
Sellers applicable severance programs, copies of which have been provided to
the Purchaser.  With respect to those Business Employees listed on _Schedule
6.7(a)-2_ who do not become Transferred Employees, the Purchaser and the
Sellers agree that they will contribute equally to the payment of severance
benefits (as provided under the Sellers applicable severance programs,
copies of which have been provided to the Purchaser) that are payable to
those Business Employees whose employment with the Sellers, or with any
Affiliate of the Sellers, ends within six months after the Closing Date,
provided, however, with respect to any such Business Employees who are re-
employed by the Sellers or any Affiliate of the Sellers within six months of
the end of his employment, the Sellers shall promptly return to the Purchaser
the amount of severance paid to such Business Employee and borne by the
Purchaser.

  

(e) _COBRA Coverage_. The Sellers shall be solely responsible for offering
and providing any COBRA Coverage with respect to any of the
Business Employees who is a "qualified beneficiary," who is covered by a
Seller Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan" and who experiences a
"qualifying event" on or prior to the Closing Date for the transfer of such
Business Employee. The Purchaser shall be solely responsible for offering and
providing any COBRA Coverage required with respect to any Transferred
Employee (or other qualified beneficiary), who becomes covered by a group
health plan sponsored or contributed to by the Purchaser, and who experiences
a qualifying event subsequent to the Closing Date for the transfer of such
Transferred Employee. For purposes hereof, each of "qualified beneficiary",
"group health plan" and "qualifying event" shall have the meaning ascribed
thereto in Section 4980B of the Code.

  

(f) _Service Credit_. For purposes of eligibility, vesting, and benefit
accrual under the benefit plans of the Purchaser providing benefits
to Transferred Employees, the Purchaser shall credit each such
Transferred Employee with his or her years of service credited by the Sellers
or their Affiliates (in accordance with the provisions of the Sellers or
their Affiliates benefit plans and policies as they are in effect as of the
date of this Agreement), to the same extent as the Transferred Employee was
entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit for such service under
any similar benefit plan of the Sellers or their Affiliates; _provided,
however_ , that the applicable Purchaser defined benefit plan shall provide
that the Transferred Employees accrued benefit thereunder shall be offset or
reduced by such Transferred Employees accrued benefit under the Huntsman
Defined Benefit Pension Plan (including any credit under any applicable
Chevron/Texaco pension benefit) and the Huntsman Local No. 436 G-U.S.W.A.I.U.
Hourly Rated Employees Pension Plan (as applicable) as of the Closing Date;
but in no event shall a Transferred Employees accrued benefit under the
applicable Purchasers plan be less than the amount determined under such
plans benefit formula without consideration of service credited by the
Sellers and their Affiliates (in accordance with the provisions of the
Sellers or their Affiliates benefit plans and policies as they are in
effect as of the date of this Agreement) prior to the Closing Date and
without reduction for the Transferred Employees accrued benefit under the
applicable Sellers plan.  The benefit plans of the

        

Purchaser shall not deny Transferred Employees coverage or benefits on the
basis of pre-existing conditions and shall credit such Transferred Employees
for any deductibles and out of pocket expenses paid in the year of initial
participation in the benefit plans of the Purchaser, provided such
Transferred Employees elect to participate in the benefit plans of the
Purchaser when first eligible to do so.  As soon as practicable, but in any
event not later than 180 days after the Closing (and, with respect to any
Transferred Employee who terminates employment with the Purchaser before such
time, as soon as practicable following a request from the Purchaser), the
Sellers shall provide the Purchaser with such information in the possession
of the Sellers that the Purchaser may reasonably require to carry out its
obligations under this _Section 6.7(f)_ , and shall otherwise cooperate with
the Purchaser with respect to such obligations.

  

(g) _Retiree Health Plan_. The Sellers shall take or cause to be taken such
actions with respect to its retiree health plan as necessary to provide that
each Transferred Employee who (i) on the Closing Date is eligible to retire
from the Sellers and receive coverage under the Sellers retiree health plan
or (ii) would become so eligible prior to the "applicable date" if his
continuous employment with the Purchaser following the Closing were deemed to
be continued employment with the Sellers, shall, on his termination from
the Purchaser, be eligible to elect, to the extent the Sellers then maintain
a retiree health plan, to receive coverage under the Sellers retiree health
plan as if he had retired directly from the Sellers.  The "applicable date"
shall mean (A) the end of the term of the collective bargaining period in
effect on the Closing, if the Transferred Employee is covered by a Labor
Agreement and (B) January 31, 2009, if the Transferred Employee is not
covered by a Labor Agreement. However, nothing herein shall operate or
be construed to prevent the Sellers from amending or terminating their
retiree health plan at any time following the Closing, provided that (1) the
Sellers, either through Sellers retiree health plan or otherwise, will
ensure that the same coverage as described in this subsection is provided to
each eligible Transferred Employee whose employment terminates by the
"applicable date" at least through the "applicable date" and (2) the Sellers
will not eliminate or materially adversely change, prior to the "applicable
date," the coverage provided for in the Sellers retiree health plan for any
employees whose employment terminates prior to the Closing Date and had been
covered by a Labor Agreement when employed by the Sellers.  This paragraph
is not intended to be, and shall not be construed as, an amendment to the
Sellers retiree health plan.

  

(h) _Information_. The Sellers shall assist the Purchaser in connection with
the transfer of employment of the Business Employees, including, to the
extent permitted by Law, by providing all information relating to each
Business Employee as the Purchaser may reasonably require (including initial
employment dates, termination dates, reemployment dates, attendance records,
personnel and status records, hours of service, compensation and tax
withholding history).  The Sellers shall exercise reasonable efforts to
facilitate communication after the date hereof between the Purchaser and
representatives of Union Employees.

  

(i) _WARN_. The Purchaser shall be liable for any liability under WARN or any
similar state or local law for any terminations of Business Employees
occurring on or after the Closing Date.

        

Section 6.8 _Labor Matters_. The Purchaser acknowledges that one or more of
the Sellers is party to the Labor Agreements. From and after the Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall recognize the applicable unions as the exclusive
representative of applicable bargaining units, as defined in the Labor
Agreements, and shall adopt the Labor Agreements, except as otherwise
provided in any agreements between the Purchaser and the applicable unions.
 If requested by the applicable union, the Purchaser shall negotiate
with the applicable union in good faith regarding the package of employee
benefits it provides to Union Employees. In adopting the Labor Agreements,
the Purchaser takes note of the applicable successorship provisions, which
provide, subject to the unions right to demand bargaining stated above, that
a successor company shall not be required to continue the existing employee
benefits provided by the Sellers, but shall be entitled to establish a
package of benefits that are reasonably comparable in the aggregate, or to
waive such commitment if certain provisions are met.

  

Section 6.9 _Risk of Loss_. The risk of loss shall remain with the Sellers
until the Closing, at which time such risk shall pass to the Purchaser. In
the event of any material loss, damage, impairment or confiscation of any of
the Assets prior to the passage of risk of loss with respect to such Asset,
the Sellers at their option shall either (i) repair, replace or restore such
property as soon as practicable after such loss, damage, impairment or
condemnation, or (ii) if insurance proceeds or any judgment or awards
(together with any deductibles or self-retention amount paid by the Sellers)
received by the Sellers would reasonably be expected to be sufficient to
repair, replace or restore the property, pay such proceeds, judgment or award
(together with the amount of any applicable deductibles or self-retention
amount) to the Purchaser on the Closing Date for such Asset.

  

Section 6.10 _Site Matters_.

  

(a) The Sellers shall provide to the Purchaser copies of their title
commitments, title policies and surveys listed on _Schedule 6.10(a)_ (the "
_Existing Title Information_ ") relating to the Conveyed Sites.
The Purchaser may obtain, at its cost, and for its and any of its lenders
benefit, title policies (" _Purchaser Title Policies_ ") and surveys ("
_Surveys_ ") with respect to any Conveyed Site. The Sellers shall reasonably
cooperate with the Purchaser by providing access to the Conveyed Sites, the
Easements, and the Sellers property records for the purpose of obtaining
Purchaser Title Policies and Surveys but, subject to _Section 6.2_ and
_Section 6.10(b)_ below, shall not be obligated to undertake any cost or
obligation in connection therewith.

  

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Port Arthur Site will be
conveyed to the Purchaser at the Closing with reservations of easements,
leasehold rights, other surface use rights and rights-of-access in favor of
the Sellers providing for the locating of and access to the pipelines, tanks,
electrical transmission lines, other facilities and effluent streams that are
described on _Schedule 6.10(b)-1_  as being retained by the Sellers from and
after the Closing together with any pumps and other equipment associated
therewith (the " _Seller Retained Easements_ ") and (ii) the Sellers will
convey, and as necessary cause their Affiliates to convey, to the Purchaser
at the Closing easements to the extent necessary across lands owned by the
Sellers providing for the locating of and access to the Easement Facilities
described on _Schedule 6.10(b)-2_ (the " _Additional Conveyed Easements_ ").
From and after the date hereof until the Closing,

        

the Sellers and the Purchaser shall cooperate in and share the out-of-pocket
third-party survey costs of identifying the property covered by the Seller
Retained Easements and the Additional Conveyed Easements, together with the
costs of the surveys.  Such costs shall be borne 50% by the Purchaser and 50%
by the Sellers.

  

Section 6.11 _Post-Closing Access to Retained Books and Records_.

  

(a) It is acknowledged by the Parties that the Retained Books and Records and
the books and records included in the Assets may include information relating
to the business of, or otherwise be of interest to, the Party not in
possession of such items and that the respective Parties should be provided
reasonable access to such information after the Closing. Accordingly, for
a period of seven years after the Closing Date, each Party shall (and shall
cause its Affiliates to) maintain and allow the other Party and its
authorized representatives reasonable access to all Retained Books and
Records relating to the Business and the books and records included in the
Assets, as applicable, upon prior written notice and during normal working
hours at the location where such Retained Books and Records or books and
records included in the Assets, as applicable, are stored, and such other
Party shall have the right, at its own expense, to make copies of such
materials; _provided, however_ , that any such access or copying shall be had
or done in such a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal
conduct of the Partys business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Parties may destroy the Retained Books and Records and the books and records
included in the Assets in a manner consistent with their respective document
retention policies.

  

(b) Without limiting the Sellers obligations under _Section 2.2_, it is
further acknowledged by the Parties that data or information relating to the
Business, or copies thereof, may be retained in the Sellers paper files,
electronic storage media or otherwise. From and after the Closing Date, the
Sellers will safeguard the confidentiality of any such data and information
to the same extent as the Sellers safeguard the confidentiality of the
Retained Books and Records.

  

(c) It is further acknowledged that information technology transition
matters, including the timing of, formatting for and other specifics
regarding delivery of books and records included in the Assets shall be
governed by the terms and provisions of the Transition Services Agreement to
the extent the Transition Services Agreement specifically addresses such
matters in lieu of this _Section 6.11_.

  

Section 6.12 _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as any Party
or any Affiliate thereof (or any person or entity indemnifying the Party
or Affiliate) actively is contesting or defending any action, suit,
proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim, demand or
grievance by a third party (other than a criminal action or investigation
brought by a Governmental Entity) in connection with (a) any transaction
contemplated under this Agreement or (b) any fact, situation, circumstance,
status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident,
action, failure to act or transaction on or prior to the Closing (or after
the Closing, if the Sellers are implicated) relating to or involving the
Business, the Assets, the Business Employees, the Assumed Liabilities or the
Retained Liabilities, then the other Party will reasonably cooperate with
such contest or defense and will make reasonably available its

        

personnel, records and information applicable to such matter as may be
necessary in connection with prudent handling of such contest or defense;
__provided, however__ , that, unless otherwise entitled to indemnification
therefor pursuant to this Agreement, the contesting or defending Party shall
reimburse the other Party for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs of such
efforts; __provided further__ _ _,_ however_, that such other Party shall
have notified the contesting or defending Party in writing prior to incurring
any material amount of such costs. This _Section 6.12_ is in addition to, and
does not in any way limit, the rights or obligations of any Party pursuant to
_Article XII_ of this Agreement.

  

Section 6.13 _Use of Names and Trademarks_.

  

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 6.13(b)_ below, after the Closing,
neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall use or otherwise
exploit any name incorporating "Huntsman" or any derivation thereof that
would reasonably be expected to be confused therewith (the " _Huntsman Name_
"), or any other tradenames, domain name, trade dress, trademark or service
mark confusingly similar thereto.

  

(b) As promptly as practicable but in no event later than six (6) months
following the Closing Date (the " _Phaseout Period_ "), the Purchaser shall
remove or otherwise obliterate the Huntsman Name from all materials owned by
the Purchaser or its Affiliates, including any buildings, vehicles,
equipment, business cards, schedules, stationery, packaging materials,
displays, signs, promotional materials, advertising, manuals, forms, computer
software and other materials or fixed assets; _provided_ , that the Purchaser
(i) shall not be obligated to remove or otherwise obliterate the Huntsman
Name (A) prior to the end of the Phaseout Period, (B) with respect to
displays of the Huntsman Name on equipment (but not buildings, vehicles,
signs and storage tanks) that is not reasonably likely to be seen by the
public or cannot be seen by the public without unlawful entry on the
applicable location of such equipment and if it is commercially unreasonable
to remove or otherwise obliterate, or (C) from all books and records (but not
stationery, promotional materials and advertising) and all archived
materials, technical drawings, invoices and manuals; (ii) shall have the
right to sell existing Inventory (on hand or in transit as of the Closing
Date) and to use existing packaging, labeling, containers, supplies,
advertising materials, technical data sheets and any similar materials
bearing the Huntsman Name until the earlier of (A) the expiration of the
Phaseout Period, and (B) the date existing stocks are exhausted; and (iii)
shall have the right to use the Huntsman Name in connection with the
transition of email services of the Business until three (3) months after the
Closing Date. The Purchaser shall comply with all applicable Laws and
regulations and policies of the Sellers in any use of the Huntsman Name.
 Compliance with the terms of this _Section 6.13(b)_ shall be
deemed compliance with the covenant not to use the Huntsman Name pursuant to
_Section 6.13(a)_ with respect to the Huntsman Name used on the Assets as of
the Closing. During any period that the Purchaser is using the Huntsman Name
as provided in this _Section 6.13(b)_ , it shall take commercially reasonable
steps to inform customers, suppliers and contractors that it is not part of
the Sellers and is using the Huntsman Name with permission solely to
facilitate the transition of the Business. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have no right to create any
new materials containing the Huntsman Name.

        

Section 6.14 _Post-Closing Matters_.

  

(a) Following the Closing, each Party shall (i) deliver to the other Parties
such further information and documents and shall execute and deliver to the
other Parties such further instruments and agreements as any other Party
shall reasonably request to consummate or confirm the transactions provided
for herein, to accomplish the purpose hereof or to assure to any other Party
the benefits hereof, and (ii) cooperate with each other to provide an orderly
transition of the Business from the Sellers to the Purchaser and to minimize
the disruption to the Business resulting from the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  

(b) Following the Closing, upon the request of any Seller, the Purchaser
will, and will cause the Transferred Employees or their replacement to

prosecution of any insurance claim or other matter that constitutes or
relates to (i) any Excluded Asset or (ii) any claim related to the existing
LOU Facility damage or any damage suffered by the Business related to
Hurricane Rita, and such Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser for its
reasonable out-of-pocket costs of such efforts; _provided_ , that the Sellers
agree that the Purchasers obligations to provide any such assistance by the
Transferred Employees or their replacement shall not unreasonably interfere
with the performance of the normal duties of such Transferred Employees or
their replacements.

  

(c) For a 180-day period following the Closing, each Seller will, and will
cause its Affiliates to refer all customer and supplier inquiries relating to
the Business to the Purchaser, except to the extent the Sellers or their
Affiliates otherwise have access to products requested by customers.

  

(d) Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall:

  

(i) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the LOU Facility to produce
an aggregate of at least 83,500,000 pounds of ethylene over a period of 30
consecutive days as soon as practicable after the Closing Date (and use
commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish such production on or before
December 24, 2008);

  

(ii) provide to Huntsman Petrochemical daily reports regarding the total
volume of production of ethylene from the LOU Facility until the earlier of
(A) such time as Huntsman Petrochemical notifies the Purchaser that such

(iii) cause its Affiliates to, provide such information to Huntsman
Petrochemical as is reasonably required by Huntsman Petrochemical relating to
the LOU Facility, including allowing Huntsman Petrochemical and Texas
Petrochemicals LP the right to audit the books and records of the Purchaser
and its Affiliates to the extent relating to the production of ethylene from

Section 6.16 _Information Technology Matters/Filings Notices_.

  

(a) The Sellers shall provide to the Purchaser promptly after the Closing a
copy of the Transferred Computer Data in the electronic form identified on
_Schedule 6.16(a)_. The format and the applicable time periods for the
Transferred Computer Data are also set forth on _Schedule 6.16(a)_.

  

(b) During the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the Closing
Date, the Sellers, upon the Purchasers reasonable request, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Purchasers efforts to acquire
its own software licenses for the software applications set forth on

to the Purchaser any seats under such software license agreements currently
used with the Business.

  

(c) The Purchaser shall defend and indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties
from and against all Losses resulting from or arising out of third-party

forth on _Schedule 4.18(a)_ ; and (b) for which notice of such filing,
payment, or similar action has been received by the Sellers.

  

Section 6.17 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Confidentiality_.

  

(a) For a period from the Closing Date until the third (3rd) anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Sellers shall not and shall cause their Affiliates not
to, directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control or participate in
the ownership, management, operation or Control of any business, whether in
corporate, proprietorship or partnership form or otherwise, engaged in
activities and operations involving the development, formulation,
testing, technical service, production, manufacturing, marketing, selling or
trading of polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene, propylene, expandable
polystyrene, and cyclohexane in North America or that otherwise competes with
the Business (a " _Restricted Business_ "); _provided, however_ , that
the restrictions contained in this _Section 6.17(a)_ shall not restrict (i)
the acquisition by the Sellers, directly or indirectly, of less than
two percent (2%) of the outstanding capital stock of any publicly traded
company engaged in a Restricted Business, (ii) the acquisition by the Sellers
of an interest in another Person (or its successor) engaged in a Restricted
Business, if such Restricted Business generates less than 25% of such
Persons (or its successors)

        

aggregate revenues, or to the extent such Restricted Business generates in
excess of 25% of such Persons (or its successors) aggregate revenues, if
the Sellers cause the acquired Person (or its successor) to divest itself
(i.e., sale to an unaffiliated third party) of the Restricted Business as
soon as is reasonably practicable, but in any event not later than one (1)
year, after such acquisition is consummated, (iii) activities necessary to

(b) For a period from the date hereof until the eighteen-month anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Sellers shall not and shall cause their directors,
officers, employees and Affiliates not to: (i) cause, solicit, induce or
encourage any Business Employee or Transferred Employee to cease being
employed in the Business as conducted with the Assets, or hire, employ or
otherwise engage any such individual in any other business; or (ii) cause,
induce or encourage any material actual or prospective client, customer,
supplier or licensor of the Business (including any existing or former
customer of the Sellers and any Person that becomes a client or customer of
the Business after the Closing) or any other Person who has a material
business relationship with the Business, to terminate or modify any such
actual or prospective relationship; _provided, however_ , solely with respect
to the Existing Mansonville Business, so long as the Sellers have complied
with their obligations set forth in the EPS Exchange and Licensing Agreement,
the Sellers shall not be restricted by the provisions of clause _(ii)_.
Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.7_ , for a period from the date
hereof until the eighteen-month anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall not and shall cause its directors, officers, employees and
subsidiaries not to:  (i) cause, solicit, induce or encourage any employee of
the Sellers other than the Business Employees pursuant to _Section 6.7_ , to
leave such employment or hire, employ or otherwise engage any such
individual. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.17(b)_  shall prohibit the
Sellers or the Purchaser from employing any person as a result of a general
solicitation to the public or general advertising.

  

(c) From and after the Closing Date, except as permitted by the Cross License

directors and employees of the Purchaser or use or otherwise exploit for its
own benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than the Purchaser, any
Business Intellectual Property that comprises trade secrets or confidential
information owned by the Sellers. The Sellers and their officers, directors
and Affiliates shall not have any obligation to keep confidential any such
Business Intellectual Property that comprises trade secrets or confidential
information owned by the Sellers if and to the extent disclosure thereof is
specifically required by Law; _provided, however_ , that in the event
disclosure is required by applicable Law, the Sellers shall, to the extent
reasonably possible, provide the Purchaser with prompt notice of such
requirement prior to making any disclosure so that the Purchaser may seek an
appropriate protective order.

  

(d) The covenants and undertakings contained in this _Section 6.17_ relate
to matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a
violation of any

        

of the terms of this _Section 6.17_ will cause irreparable injury to each
non-defaulting Party, the amount of which will be impossible to estimate or
determine and which cannot be adequately compensated. Accordingly, the remedy
at law for any breach of this _Section 6.17_ will be inadequate. Therefore,
any Party will be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or other
equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of any
breach of this _Section 6.17_ without the necessity of proving actual
damages or posting any bond whatsoever. The rights and remedies provided by
this _Section 6.17_ are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and
remedies which the Parties may have hereunder or at Law or in equity.

  

Section 6.18 _Receivables and Payables_. After the Closing, the Sellers shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to timely pay all Payables as they
become due. In the event that there is a dispute as to the amount, time of
payment, or any other issue in connection with a Receivable or Payable after
the Closing, the Sellers shall notify the Purchaser of such dispute in a
timely manner and prior to the commencement of any collection proceeding by
the Sellers and the Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with the Sellers to resolve such dispute to the Sellers
reasonable satisfaction.

  

Section 6.19 _Customer Access_. During the period commencing on the
date hereof and ending on the Closing Date, the Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for the Purchaser to meet or
otherwise communicate with any customer of the Business.  Without the prior
consent of the Sellers, the Purchaser shall not arrange any such meetings
itself or make any contact with such Persons for the purpose of discussing
the Business or any Assumed Contract; _provided, however_ , nothing herein
shall preclude the Purchaser from having contact of any nature with any such
Person for any other purpose, including to discuss existing business that the
Purchaser may have with any such Person or potential future business not
related to the Business. One or more employees or representatives of the
Sellers may accompany the Purchasers representative to such meetings (other
than those described in the proviso to the preceding sentence) and may
participate with the Purchasers representative in any related discussions.
Satisfaction by the Purchaser with the results of any such meeting or
discussions with any such Person in respect of the Business shall not be a
condition precedent to its obligations to close the transactions contemplated
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the foregoing activities
shall only be permitted to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

  

Section 6.20 _Fenceline Monitoring at Port Arthur Site_. Huntsman
Petrochemical is subject to an Agreed Final Judgment (" _Agreed Judgment_ ")
in the case of _State of Texas v. Huntsman Petrochemical Corporation,_
No. GV301473 (D.Ct. Travis County, Texas), pursuant to which
Huntsman Petrochemical, under the terms of a Supplemental Environmental
Project, is obligated to monitor and report airborne concentrations of
certain chemicals along the fenceline of the Port Arthur Site.  If Huntsman
Petrochemical has not completed its obligations pursuant to the Agreed
Judgment prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cooperate with
Huntsman Petrochemical in arranging for completion of those
activities required by the Agreed Judgment that have not been completed to
the satisfaction of the State of Texas.  Without limiting the foregoing, the
Purchaser shall (a) provide electricity to and security for the fenceline
monitoring system, (b) provide Huntsman Petrochemical and its contractor with
access to the fenceline monitoring system and restrict the access of other
Persons to the fenceline monitoring system,

        

(c) notify Huntsman Petrochemical of any tampering the Purchaser discovers or
becomes aware of with respect to the fenceline monitoring system, including
any unauthorized attempts to access any part of the fenceline monitoring
system by anyone other than personnel authorized in writing by Huntsman
Petrochemical, (d) respond to all reasonable requests from Huntsman
Petrochemical or the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for
information relating to the fenceline monitoring program or the Agreed
Judgment, and (e) not take any action that would interfere with, damage, or
disturb the fenceline monitoring system or otherwise take any action
to impair its functionality during the period that the Agreed Judgment is
in effect. Following completion of the actions required by the Agreed
Judgment, whether such actions are completed before or after Closing,
Huntsman Petrochemical shall, at the later of (i) the Closing or (ii) the
date such actions are completed, convey title to and responsibility for the
equipment to the Purchaser (at no cost to the Purchaser), or, at the
Purchasers election, Huntsman Petrochemical shall remove any or all
equipment used in connection with the monitoring program.

  

Section 6.21 _Port Arthur Performance Test; LOU Facility_. The Sellers will
use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the rebuild work on the LOU
Facility and satisfy the Performance Test as promptly as practicable.  If
the Purchaser demonstrates (as validated by an independent engineer) that the
LOU Facility is not capable of operating on a sustained basis at rates that
are 99% or more of its average production rates during the 2004 calendar year
and such failure is as a result of any defect in the engineering or in
the workmanship or materials with respect to the rebuild of the LOU Facility
that has appeared within one year of the Closing Date, then the Sellers
shall reimburse the Purchaser or its Affiliates for all payments made to
contractors to repair such defect, whether such repairs are covered by third
party warranties or not. The reimbursement obligation in the foregoing
sentence shall be limited by the following: (i) the Purchaser shall first
pursue, and shall cause its Affiliates to pursue, by all commercially
reasonable means short of litigation, all claims and rights with respect to
any warranty claims under the Rebuild Agreements; and, (ii) the Sellers
aggregate reimbursement obligation shall be limited to $15,000,000 and shall
be reduced by any amounts recovered by the Purchaser from contractors under
the Rebuild Agreements. The Purchaser agrees not to amend any of the terms
of the Rebuild Agreements in any manner that reduces the scope of the
warranties available under such Rebuild Agreements. The Purchaser agrees to
assign all its rights and claims against contractors with respect to amounts
paid or reimbursed by the Sellers. The Sellers shall make reimbursement
required under this _Section 6.21_ within thirty (30) days of invoice by the
Purchaser or its Affiliates.

  

Section 6.22 _Other Property_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Purchaser shall have the option to exclude the Longview Owned Site from the
Assets, in which case the Longview Owned Site shall be an Excluded Asset for
all purposes set forth herein. The Purchasers option to exclude the
Longview Owned Site shall expire on the date which is thirty (30) days from
the date hereof and may be exercised by providing notice to the Sellers
before the end of such 30-day period.

  

(b) The Purchaser shall have the option to purchase the real property
identified on the map attached as  _Schedule 6.22(b)_. The
Purchasers option shall expire on the date which is thirty (30) days from
the date hereof and may be exercised by

        

providing notice to the Sellers before the end of such 30-day period. If the
Purchaser exercises such option, at the Closing the applicable Seller shall
convey all of its right, title and interest in and to such real property
pursuant to a deed containing a special warranty of title and without
representation, warranty or indemnity under this Agreement except for the
representation and warranty set forth in _Section 4.4(e)_.

  

 **ARTICLE VII** 
  
 TAX MATTERS

  

Section 7.1 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Attached as _Schedule 7.1_ is
an allocation of the Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities among
the Assets. _Schedule 7.1_ is intended to be consistent with the
requirements of Sections 1060 and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "
_Allocation Statement_ "). The Purchaser and the Sellers shall cooperate with
one another in good faith to make any needed modifications to the Allocation
Statement to reflect any adjustments to or final determination of the amount
of the Assumed Liabilities or the value of the Inventory, and subject to such
modifications the Sellers and the Purchaser agree to file all Tax Returns
(including filing Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) consistent with the
Allocation Statement.

  

Section 7.2 _Transfer Taxes_. Any sales, use or transfer Taxes or
recording fees payable as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be borne equally by the Purchaser and the Sellers. The
Parties shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all
returns, questionnaires, applications and other documents regarding transfer
Taxes and all transfer, recording, registration and other fees that become
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby that are
required or permitted to be filed at or prior to the Closing. The Sellers
and the Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Governmental Entity or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any sales, use or
transfer Taxes with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

Section 7.3 _Certificate of Non-Foreign Status_. At the Closing, each Seller
(other than Huntsman Canada) shall deliver to the Purchaser a certificate of
non-foreign status of such Seller which meets the requirements of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2).

  

 **ARTICLE VIII 
  
 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS**

  

Section 8.1 _Environmental Indemnification by the Sellers_.

  

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Article VIII_ , from and after the
Closing Date the Sellers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold
harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against, and shall
reimburse the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for, all Losses that the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties incur resulting from or arising out of the
following (collectively, " _Seller Environmental Liabilities_ "):

  

(i) any Indemnifiable Assumed Liabilities;

        

(ii) any Longview Environmental Contamination;

  

(iii) any Peru Environmental Contamination;

  

(iv) any Off-Site Disposal Activities;

  

(v) any breach of the Sellers representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 4.17_ ( _"Environmental Rep Breaches")_ ; and

  

(vi) any breach of the Sellers obligations in this _Article VIII_.

  

(b) In the event that a Purchaser Indemnified Party becomes aware of any
claim, suit, action, litigation, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation,
inquiry or other proceeding by a Governmental Entity or other Person or other
occurrence that may potentially result in indemnification for any Seller
Environmental Liabilities or in Losses in excess of $25,000 that would count
towards the Environmental Deductible, the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall,
as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware of such occurrence,
notify the Sellers in writing of such occurrence (a " _Purchaser
Environmental Indemnity Claim_ "). The failure by the Purchaser to
timely provide such notice shall not affect the right of the Purchaser
to indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , except to the extent
the Sellers are prejudiced by any failure by the Purchaser to provide
sufficient and timely notice of the occurrence and the Purchasers proposed
response.

  

(c) In the event of an indemnity claim by either Party involving Remediation,
for which either Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ , the Managing Party shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to manage all matters arising out of, and perform all Remediation
and other corrective actions, resulting from or relating to such Remediation
as follows:

  

(i) The Managing Party shall manage all matters, and perform all Remediation
and other corrective actions, arising out of, resulting from or relating to,
such Remediation, but shall provide Meaningful Participation Rights to the
other Party. Such management may include the conduct of and final decision-
making regarding all studies, monitoring, and remedial activities, and any
and all other activities for the purpose of investigating, remedying,
settling or otherwise addressing the Remediation, and shall include the right
and responsibility for dealing with all Governmental Entities concerning the
Remediation.

  

(ii) In the event that any Seller is the Managing Party conducting
Remediation on a Site, Easement, or Facility owned or operated by the
Purchaser, such Seller shall use all commercially reasonable measures to
minimize interference with the Purchasers operation of the Business in
connection with its management of or other activities associated with the
Remediation, and shall not interfere with the Purchasers operation of the
Business without the Purchasers prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Sellers also shall
take all commercially reasonable measures to ensure that the Sellers and
their respective agents and representatives follow the

        

Purchasers reasonable safety and operational procedures, and do not create
or increase an enforcement risk for the Purchaser associated with its
operations. The Sellers activities with regard to the Remediation shall be
subject to reasonable limitations on access to the Sites or Easements, giving
due consideration for the nature of the activity, the urgency of or immediate
need for action, site security requirements, standard site operating
procedures, and any specific requirements of a Governmental Entity.

  

(iii) The Managing Party, upon the request of the other Party, shall retain
counsel chosen by the other Party to represent the other Party in connection
with the Remediation, and the Managing Party shall pay the fees and expenses
of any such counsel, _provided_ , that counsel selected by the other Party
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Managing Party, such acceptance not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

(iv) The Party that is not the Managing Party will cooperate with and assist,
and shall not interfere with, the Managing Partys management, performance,
decision-making or negotiations with respect to the Remediation, subject to
the Meaningful Participation Rights of the Party that is not the Managing
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall
limit or restrict either Partys ability to report or disclose information to
Governmental Entities or other third parties that such Party reasonably
believes is required to be disclosed under applicable Laws, or to take such
actions as may be necessary to comply with applicable Laws.

  

(v) The Managing Party shall be responsible for securing at its own cost and
expense all Environmental Permits and other Licenses (including any that may
be in the other Partys name) required in connection with the Remediation,
and the Party that is not the Managing Party shall cooperate and join with
the Managing Party to procure such approvals, including joining in and
executing any necessary permit applications and supplying documentation or
witnesses reasonably required therefor.

  

(vi) The Managing Partys obligations with respect to the Remediation shall
include all actions necessary or appropriate to resolve such claims in a
manner sufficient to (1) obtain a "no further action" letter or similar
document, or other evidence of approval from the relevant Governmental
Entity, or (2) if the relevant Governmental Entity does not issue a "no
further action" letter or similar document or approval, or the claim is not
of the character that would result in the issuance of such a letter, document
or approval, then bring the operation or condition that is the subject of the
Remediation into compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws.

  

(d) The Sellers shall not be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against Losses resulting from, based
upon or arising out of Seller Environmental Liabilities of the type described
in _Sections 8.1(a)(i) (iii)_ and _(v)_ involving Remediation, except to the
extent that such Remediation is:

        

(x) undertaken (A) to satisfy the terms of an official order or directive
issued by a Governmental Entity pursuant to any Environmental Law, or (B) to
satisfy a payment obligation to a third party for Remediation; and (y) not
incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties as a result of any instigation,
encouragement, action, failure or change of the types set forth in items _(1)
(8)_ set forth below:

  

(1) any investigation, claim or proceeding initiated or instituted by any
Governmental Entity or any other Person that is instigated or encouraged,
directly or indirectly, by a Purchaser Indemnified Party, unless such claim
or proceeding arose out of the submission of a report to a Governmental
Entity that was required by applicable Law;

  

(2) any sampling or other investigation of environmental conditions at any of
the Sites or the Easements, except for those investigations required to be
performed pursuant to applicable Environmental Laws or pursuant to the order
or directive of any Governmental Entity and except to the extent provided in
subsection _8.1(e)_ ;

  

(3) any demolition of existing structures or development of new structures at
the Sites or the Easements requiring removal or disturbance of soil beneath
the ground surface, except to the extent provided in subsection _8.1(e)_ ;

  

(4) any post-Closing change in use of any of the Sites or Facilities to
anything other than industrial, manufacturing, or chemical industry uses (
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the shutdown of use of a Facility shall not
be deemed a change of use hereunder so long as public access to the Site or
Facility remains restricted in a manner consistent with ongoing industrial,
manufacturing or chemical industry uses);

  

(5) the failure of any Purchaser Indemnified Party to cooperate with the
Sellers in a commercially reasonable manner in addressing such Losses, to the
extent such failure to cooperate in a commercially reasonable manner is the
proximate cause of any increase in or exacerbation of such Losses;

  

(6) any of the activities set forth in items _(1)_ , _(2)_ , _(3)_ and _(5)_
 above by any Purchaser Indemnified Party on any property adjacent to the
Sites or Easements, whether before or after the Closing;

  

(7) any change in Environmental Laws after the Closing;

  

(8) any failure of the Purchaser to comply with any environmental
restrictions, limitations, or requirements set forth on _Schedule 8.1(d)_.

        

With respect to Losses incurred in connection with or arising out of any
Remediation requirement, the Sellers shall be obligated to indemnify and hold
harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties only to the extent of the least
cost remedy allowed under Environmental Laws applicable to the Sites and
Facilities that is consistent with the ongoing use of the Sites and
Facilities for chemical manufacturing purposes, such as (for example only)
recording deed notices or restrictive covenants in lieu of performing soil or
groundwater remediation.

  

(e) Unknown On-Site Environmental Contamination discovered by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties during any of the following activities shall constitute
the sole exceptions to the limitations set forth in subsections _8.1(d)(2)_
and _(3)_ above:

  

(i) The voluntary installation of perimeter monitoring wells near the outside
boundaries of any of the Odessa Site, the Marysville Site or the Longview
Owned Site in a manner consistent with subsection _8.1(f)_ ;

  

(ii) routine maintenance of existing facilities;

  

(iii) demolition of all or any portion of the existing facilities and related
utilities down to ground surface (but not below ground surface unless
necessary to properly isolate the underground structure from the operating
portions of the facility) in a manner consistent with subsection _8.1(f)_ ;

  

(iv) construction of new facilities or modification of existing facilities
(but not environmental sampling facilities other than the perimeter
monitoring wells covered by subsection _8.1(e)(i)_ ) in a manner consistent
with subsection _8.1(f)_ ; and

  

(v) activities required by applicable Laws or by a Governmental Entity
pursuant to Environmental Laws in effect at Closing.

  

(f) The exceptions set forth in subsections _8.1(e)(i)_ , _(iii)_ and _(iv)_
above shall be effective only if the Purchaser Indemnified Parties satisfy
the following conditions:

  

(i) the Purchaser shall provide written notice to the Sellers at least forty-
five (45) days prior to initiation of any installation, demolition or
construction activities;

  

(ii) the written notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and
extent of the proposed activity and its location on the Site, with
information sufficient to enable the Sellers reasonably to evaluate the
extent and nature of the contemplated disturbance of the property;.

  

(iii) the Sellers shall have thirty (30) days in which to provide the
Purchaser with comments and suggestions on the proposed activity;

  

(iv) the Purchaser shall take into account and, where commercially
reasonable, accommodate the Sellers comments and suggestions regarding the
project.

        

(g) Any Release of Hazardous Material, or other contamination or
environmental condition, at, on, or under the Sites that is confirmed or
discovered by the Purchaser within one (1) year after the Closing Date shall
be presumed to be Unknown On-Site Environmental Contamination covered by the
Sellers indemnification obligations in _Section 8.1_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , such presumption shall be a rebuttable presumption which may be
challenged by the Sellers through the introduction of evidence of any post-
Closing Releases of Hazardous Material or other post-Closing activities that
may have caused or contributed to the Environmental Contamination. A Release
of Hazardous Material or other contamination or environmental condition that
is confirmed or discovered by the Purchaser more than one (1) year after the
Closing Date also may be Unknown On-Site Environmental Contamination but
there shall be no presumption and the burden of proof with respect to any
such matter shall be established by applicable Law.

  

(h) To the extent there is an Environmental Rep Breach that results in Losses
(other than Losses associated with Remediation) with respect to which the
Sellers are obligated to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , the Purchaser shall
have the right to manage and control any and all contact with any
Governmental Entity arising out of such Environmental Rep Breach, and any
such Purchaser Environmental Indemnity Claim shall not be subject to the
limitations set forth in _Sections 8.1(c)  (g)_; _provided, however_ , the
Sellers shall be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties only to the extent of the least cost remedy allowed under
Environmental Laws applicable to the Sites and Facilities that is consistent
with the ongoing use of the Sites and Facilities for industrial or chemical
manufacturing purposes.

  

Section 8.2 _Environmental Indemnification by the Purchaser_.

  

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Article VIII_, from and after the
Closing Date the Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnified Parties from and against, and shall reimburse the Seller
Indemnified Parties for all Losses that the Seller Indemnified Parties incur
resulting from or arising out of (i) Remediation of any and all Known On-Site
Environmental Contamination and all Known Off-Site Migrated Environmental
Contamination, except to the extent that there is a Material Increase in
Known On-Site Environmental Contamination, and (ii) Indemnifiable Assumed
Liabilities or any Environmental Rep Breaches to the extent the Sellers are
not liable for such matters based upon the limitations set forth in _Section
8.6_.

  

(b) In the event that a Seller Indemnified Party becomes aware of any claim,
suit, action, litigation, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, inquiry
or other proceeding by a Governmental Entity or other Person or other
occurrence that may potentially result in indemnification pursuant to this
_Section 8.2_ (a " _Seller Environmental Indemnity Claim_ "), the Seller
Indemnified Party shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming
aware of such occurrence, notify the Purchaser in writing of such Seller
Environmental Indemnity Claim. The failure by any Seller to timely
provide such notice shall not affect the right of the Sellers to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_, except to the extent the
Purchaser is prejudiced by such delay or omission.

   

66  

   

(c) In the event that a Seller Indemnified Party makes a Seller Environmental
Indemnity Claim for which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Section 8.2_ , the Purchaser shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to manage all matters arising out of, resulting from or relating to such
Seller Environmental Indemnity Claim. To this end, the Purchaser shall,
within thirty (30) days after the notice described in _Section 8.2(b)_ has
been given, notify the Sellers of its intent to manage such
Seller Environmental Indemnity Claim. In the event the Purchaser exercises
this management option and provides such notice to the Sellers, then the
Purchaser shall manage such claim in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 8.1(h)_, and shall provide Meaningful Participation Rights to the
Sellers at all times. In the event the Purchaser fails or refuses to exercise
this management option and provide such notice to the Sellers, then the
Sellers shall manage such claim in accordance with the provisions of _Section
8.1(c)_, and shall provide Meaningful Participation Rights to the Purchaser
at all times.

  

Section 8.3 _Environmental Covenants of the Sellers_.

  

(a) The Sellers will, and will cause their Affiliates to, (i) prepare
complete and accurate notices and reports required under Environmental Laws
and Environmental Permits with regard to the Assets and the Business to the
extent such notices and reports relate to periods during which the Assets and
the Business were owned or operated by the Sellers; (ii) provide copies of
all such notices and reports to the Purchaser as soon as practical; (iii)
sign and, if required by applicable Law, certify all such notices and
reports, in each case after a reasonable inquiry with regard to the
information contained in such notices and reports; and (iv) file all such
notices and reports with the appropriate Governmental Entity or other third
party no later than the date on which such reports or notices are required to
be filed. The Sellers will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete
all of the foregoing actions prior to the Closing Date, but if such actions
are not required to be completed prior to the Closing Date, then the Sellers
shall complete after the Closing Date any actions that are not required to be
completed prior to the Closing Date and the Purchaser shall provide to the
Sellers access to any records or other information reasonably requested to
enable the Sellers to prepare such notices and reports.

  

(b) The Sellers will, between the date of this Agreement and Closing, prepare
updated surveys for asbestos containing materials at each of the Facilities,
and shall provide such updated surveys to the Purchaser on or prior to the
Closing Date. The Sellers shall also cause the data described in _Section
4.17(l)_ to be transferred to the Purchaser as of the Closing Date.

  

Section 8.4 _Environmental Covenants of the Purchaser_.

  

(a) The Purchaser shall perform Remediation of all Known On-Site
Environmental Contamination and all Known Off-Site Migrated Environmental
Contamination as may be required by Environmental Law.

  

(b) The Purchaser shall pay the costs associated with the Indemnifiable
Assumed Liabilities and Environmental Rep Breaches to the extent such costs
fall outside

        

the scope of the Sellers indemnity obligations for the Indemnifiable Assumed
Liabilities and Environmental Rep Breaches based upon the limitations set
forth in _Section 8.6_.

  

Section 8.5 _Other Environmental Matters_. Notwithstanding the limitations set
forth in _Section 6.2_, the Purchaser and its agents and representatives
shall have the right, during the period commencing on the date hereof through
the Closing Date, to contact relevant Governmental Entities and discuss the
environmental performance of and other environmental matters with regard to
the Business and the Assets, as part of the Purchasers diligence activities.
 In connection with the foregoing, the Sellers shall be notified in advance
of any such contacts by the Purchaser and shall be provided with
an unrestricted right to participate in all such discussions with
Governmental Entities unless either (i) the Sellers do not make themselves
available for such discussions in a reasonably timely manner; or (ii) a
Governmental Entity requests an _ex parte_ meeting with the Purchaser.

  

Section 8.6 _Limitations on Liability of the Sellers_.

  

(a) Subject to _Section 8.6(d)_ below, the Sellers shall have no liability
under this _Article VIII_ arising out of or relating to any Losses incurred
by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any Indemnifiable Assumed
Liabilities or any Environmental Rep Breaches except if the aggregate Losses
incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties hereunder with respect thereto
exceed $15,000,000 (the " _Environmental Deductible_ ") (and then, only to
the extent such aggregate Losses exceed $15,000,000).

  

(b) Once the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have suffered total Losses for
Indemnifiable Assumed Liabilities and Environmental Rep Breaches in excess of
the amount specified in  _Section 8.6(a)_ , the Sellers shall have no
liability under this _Article VIII_ arising out of or relating to any
Indemnifiable Assumed Liability or any Environmental Rep Breach that results
in Losses of less than $25,000.

  

(c) In no event shall the Sellers aggregate liability arising out of or
relating to Losses for Indemnifiable Assumed Liabilities and Environmental
Rep Breaches incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties exceed
$150,000,000 (the " _Environmental Cap_ ").

  

(d) At the time that any Purchaser Indemnified Party makes any Purchaser
Environmental Indemnity Claim that arises out of or is related to Losses
incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any Indemnifiable Assumed
Liabilities or any Environmental Rep Breaches that may reasonably be expected
to be covered by Novacors indemnification obligations under the Novacor
Agreement, the Sellers agree that at the Purchasers sole cost and expense,
the Sellers shall bring a claim for indemnification against Novacor with
respect to such Purchaser Environmental Indemnity Claim and pursue such claim
against Novacor in good faith. If the Sellers receive any proceeds from
Novacor as a result of pursuing such claim, the Sellers shall deliver such
proceeds to the Purchaser, and no Losses will be attributed to
the Environmental Deductible to the extent of such proceeds. If the Sellers
do not receive any proceeds from Novacor as a result of such claim, the
Losses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties associated with such
Purchaser Environmental Indemnity Claim shall apply to the Environmental
Deductible.

        

(e) Any Losses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties related to Off-
Site Disposal Activities shall be subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 12.2(c)_ related to Other Retained Liabilities.

  

(f) The Sellers shall have no liability under this _Article VIII_ resulting
from or arising out of any Losses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties for any Indemnifiable Assumed Liabilities for which a Purchaser
Environmental Indemnity Claim is made by any Purchaser Indemnified Party
after the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Closing Date.

  

Section 8.7 _Mitigation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
the Parties shall have a duty to use commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate any prospective or actual Losses arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In futherance, and
not in limitation of the foregoing, the Purchaser agrees that whenever it
brings a Purchaser Environmental Indemnity Claim with respect to Longview
Environmental Contamination or Environmental Rep Breaches (with respect to
remediation) against the Sellers, it will also bring a claim against Eastman
Chemical Company pursuant to the Longview Lease and whenever it brings a
Purchaser Environmental Indemnity Claim with respect to any Assumed
Environmental Liabilities or any Environmental Rep Breaches (with respect to
remediation) relating to the Port Arthur Site, it will also bring a claim
against the Texaco Parties pursuant to the Assigned Indemnity.

second Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in _Sections 9.1_ , _9.2_ and _9.3_ (other than those

such other date as the Parties may agree. The Closing shall take place at
such place as the Parties may agree.

  

Section 10.2 _Polymers Business Closing_.

  

(a) In the event that (i) one or more of the conditions to Closing contained
in _Sections 9.2(a)_  _(l)_  (solely as each such condition to Closing
relates to the Base Chemicals Business) has not been satisfied or waived
prior to August 15, 2007, and at such time no condition or circumstance
exists that could reasonably be expected to cause any condition to Closing
set forth in _Sections 9.1_ , _9.2_  or _9.3_ (solely as each such condition
to Closing relates to the Base Chemicals Business) not to be satisfied on or
prior to the Expiration Date, and (ii) the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Section 9.1_ , _9.2(a)_   _(i)_ and _9.3_ (solely as each such condition to
Closing relates to the Polymers Business) have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Polymers Closing), the Purchaser shall have the option (the " _Polymers
Purchase Option_ "), which it may exercise in its sole discretion, to close
on the purchase of the Polymers Business and the Assets related thereto (the
" _Polymers Closing_ ") separate from the closing of the purchase of the Base
Chemicals Business.

  

(b) The Purchaser shall exercise the Polymers Purchase Option by delivering a
written notice to the Sellers together with a draft of the Amendment

the appropriate terms, conditions and mechanics to facilitate the Base
Chemicals Closing occurring separately at a later date.  The Amendment will
include the terms set

        

forth on _Schedule 10.2(c)_. The Purchaser and the Sellers agree that at the
time any such discussions take place that they will work together in
good faith so that the Amendment will facilitate the separate Polymers
Closing and Base Chemicals Closing and reflect the intentions of the Parties
as set forth in this Agreement and _Schedule 10.2(c)_ to the fullest
extent possible. If the Purchaser exercises the Polymers Business Option,
the Polymers Closing shall occur on the first (1st) Business Day after
the Purchaser and the Sellers have executed the Amendment unless otherwise

fees and expenses) (collectively, " _Losses_ ") that the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties incur resulting from or arising out of (i) any breach of
any representations and warranties of the Sellers in _Article IV_ (except for
breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.17_ ,
which are subject to the terms of _Article VIII_ ), including any inaccuracy
of any representation or warranty resulting from such representation or
warranty being treated as if it were brought down and remade effective on and
as of the Closing Date (except where such representation and warranty is
specifically limited by its terms to a specified date, in which case such
representation shall not be treated as having been so brought down and
remade); (ii) any breach of any obligation of the Sellers in this Agreement
(except for any breaches of any obligation of the Sellers set forth in
_Article VIII_ , which are addressed therein); or (iii) any Retained
Liabilities (except for Longview Environmental Contamination, Peru

subject to the terms of _Article VIII_).

  

(b) Subject to the provisions of this _Article XII_ , from and after the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnified Parties from and against all Losses that the Seller Indemnified
Parties incur resulting from or arising out of (i) any breach of any
representations and warranties of the Purchaser in this Agreement, (ii) any
breach of any obligation of the Purchaser in this Agreement, or (iii) the
Purchasers ownership or operation of the Assets or the Business from and
after the Closing Date or relating to the Assumed Liabilities, in each case
to the extent such Losses do not result from or arise out of a matter to
which the Purchaser is otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 12.2(a)_ or _Article VIII_.

  

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 12.2(a)(iii)_ , the Purchaser shall pay to (or
on behalf of) the Seller Indemnified Parties one hundred percent (100%) of
the first Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) of any Losses resulting from or
arising out of any Other Retained Liabilities incurred by the Seller
Indemnified Parties in each twelve month

        

period measured from the Closing Date (without carryover to any subsequent

or (B) for which a claim is made by the Seller Indemnified Parties after the
twentieth (20th) anniversary of the Closing Date;

  

(ii) in no event shall the Purchaser be required to pay or reimburse the
Seller Indemnified Parties for any Losses resulting from or arising out of

and

  

(iv) in no event shall the Purchaser be required to pay or reimburse the
Seller Indemnified Parties for any Losses resulting from or arising out of a
matter to which the Purchaser is entitled to indemnification pursuant to

(d) For the purposes of determining when a claim is made by a Seller
Indemnified Party for the Purchaser to pay or reimburse the Seller
Indemnified Parties for Losses resulting from or arising out of any Other
Retained Liabilities pursuant to _Section 12.2(c)_ to which the mitigation
requirements of _Section 12.3(f)_  apply, the date on which the Purchaser
receives a notice from a Seller Indemnified Party which states, if
applicable, that the Seller Indemnified Parties are seeking to first recover
such Losses from Novacor and/or the Texaco Parties as required pursuant to
_Section 12.3(f)_ shall be deemed to be the date on which such claim is made
by the Sellers.

  

(e) For purposes of determining the amount of Losses suffered by a Party for
breach of any representation and warranty, any qualifiers regarding
"materiality," "material adverse effect" or "Material Adverse Effect"
contained in such representations and warranties shall be disregarded.

_Schedule 12.2(f)_.

  

Section 12.3 _Indemnification Procedures_.  Except as otherwise provided for
under _Article VIII_ , claims for indemnification under this Agreement shall
be asserted and resolved as follows:

        

(a) Any Indemnified Party claiming indemnification under this Agreement with
respect to any claim asserted against the Indemnified Party by a third party
(" _Third Party Claim_ ") in respect of any matter that is subject to
indemnification under _Section 12.2_ (without regard to the limitations in
_Section 12.4(a)_ or _(b)_ , as applicable) shall promptly (i) notify the
other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the Third Party Claim and (ii)
transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (" _Claim Notice_ ")
describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Third Party Claim, a copy
of all papers served with respect to such claim (if any), the Indemnified
Partys best estimate of the amount of Losses attributable to the Third Party
Claim and the basis of the Indemnified Partys request for indemnification
under this Agreement. Failure to timely provide such Claim Notice shall not
affect the right of the Indemnified Partys indemnification hereunder, except
to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such delay or omission.

  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified
Party against a Third Party Claim, except when (i) a Third Party Claim is
made by a Governmental Entity, in which case the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to control such claim solely to the extent it pertains to such
Indemnified Party or (ii) the Purchaser is the Indemnified Party and the
amount of Losses attributable to the Third Party Claim is in excess of the
Cap, in which case the Purchaser shall have the right to control such claim.
If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim,
then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third Party
Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (who shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), by all appropriate
proceedings, to a final conclusion or settled at the discretion of the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with this _Section 12.3(b)_.  The
Indemnifying Party shall defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith and
have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise
or settlement thereof; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not
enter into any settlement agreement without the written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided further_ , that such consent
shall not be required if (a) the settlement agreement contains a complete
and unconditional general release by the third party asserting the claim to
all Indemnified Parties affected by the claim, (b) the settlement agreement
does not contain any sanction or restriction upon the conduct of any business
by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, and (c) the Indemnifying Party
actually pays any and all amounts required pursuant to such settlement and is
not disputing its indemnification obligation with respect to such claim. If
requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees, at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which
the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including the making of any related
counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third Party Claim or any cross
complaint against any Person. The Indemnified Party may participate in,
but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim
controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 12.3(b)_ , and
the Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to
such participation. If in connection with any Third Party Claim related to
any breach of a representation or warranty of the Sellers in this Agreement,
which the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of, the third
party making such claim offers a

        

settlement to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party must notify the
Indemnified Party of such settlement offer. If such settlement offer is less
than or equal to the Cap and the Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying
Party that it believes that it is advisable for the Indemnifying Party to
accept such settlement offer, but the Indemnifying Party rejects such
settlement offer and the Third Party Claim proceeds to a judgment, and such
judgment exceeds the Cap, the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to pay
the entire amount of such judgment notwithstanding the fact that such amount
exceeds the Cap. If such settlement offer is more than the Cap and the
Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party that it believes that it is
advisable for the Indemnifying Party to accept such settlement offer, but the
Indemnifying Party rejects such settlement offer and the Third Party
Claim proceeds to a judgment, and such judgment exceeds the settlement offer,
the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to pay the entire amount of such
judgment less the amount which the Indemnified Party would have been required
to pay had the settlement offer been accepted, notwithstanding the fact that
such amount exceeds the Cap.

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party within 30
days after receipt of any Claim Notice that the Indemnifying Party elects to
defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 12.3(b)_ , or to the extent
an Indemnified Party is controlling a claim pursuant to the parenthetical in
the first sentence of _Section 12.3(b)_ , then the Indemnified Party shall
defend any such Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified
Party, by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted
diligently by the Indemnified Party to a final conclusion or settled. In
such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall defend any such Third Party
Claim in good faith and have full control of such defense and proceedings;
_provided however_ , that the Indemnified Party may not enter into any
compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim (except when a Third Party
Claim is made by a Governmental Entity and solely to the extent it pertains
to the Indemnified Party) if indemnification is to be sought hereunder,
without the Indemnifying Partys consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If requested by the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party agrees, at its sole cost
and expense, to cooperate with the Indemnified Party and its counsel in
contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnified Party elects to
contest. The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this
_Section 12.3(c)_ , and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and
expenses with respect to such participation; _provided_ , that if at any time
the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing such Third Party Claim is a
Loss subject to this _Article XII_ , the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim in accordance with _Section
12.3(b)_ (except when a Third Party Claim is made by a Governmental Entity,
in which case the Indemnified Party shall have the right to control such
defense or settlement solely to the extent it pertains to such Indemnified
Party).

  

(d) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party
Claim may be asserted by notice to the Party from whom indemnification is
sought.

        

(e) In the event an Indemnified Party shall recover Losses in respect of a
claim of indemnification under this _Article XII_ , no other Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to recover the same Losses in respect of a claim for
indemnification.

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties shall have a
duty to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any prospective or
actual Losses arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, the Sellers agree that whenever any Seller Indemnified Party
seeks reimbursement from the Purchaser for any Other Retained Liability
pursuant to _Section 12.2(c)_ , such Seller Indemnified Party will also
bring, to the extent applicable, a claim against Novacor pursuant to the
Novacor Agreement or the Texaco Parties pursuant to the Texaco Agreement as
the case may be.

  

(g) The right to indemnification based on representations and warranties in
this Agreement shall not be affected by any knowledge of the Indemnified
Party that may have been acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time,
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of any such
representation and warranty. The waiver of any condition based on
the accuracy of any representation and warranty, or on the performance of
or compliance with any covenant or agreement in this Agreement, will not
affect any of the remedies set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) of the
first sentence of _Section 12.5(a)_ that may be available.

Business Transition_ ") on or before the end of the EPS Exchange and
Licensing Agreement to be entered into at the Closing (the " _EPS Exchange

implementation of the Mansonville Business Transition or (C) the contracts or
customer relationships associated with the Existing Mansonville Business (the

Purchaser waives any claim it might otherwise have under this Agreement based
upon or arising out of the Mansonville Transition Risk.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section 12.8_ shall create any liability of the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to the Sellers for any liabilities or
obligations incurred by the Sellers resulting out of or related to the
Mansonville Facility or the Mansonville Site after the EPS Exchange and
Licensing Agreement has terminated or otherwise expired.

party may furnish to the other parties in writing. Any such notice,
communication or delivery shall be deemed given or made (i) on the date of
delivery, if delivered in person or by overnight courier service, (ii)

Section 13.2 _Schedules and Exhibits_. The Schedules and Exhibits hereto are
hereby incorporated into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as
if set out in full herein.

        

Section 13.3 _Assignment; Successors in Interest_.

  

(a) Except as provided in this _Section 13.3_ , no assignment or transfer by
any Party of such Partys rights and obligations hereunder shall be made
without the prior written consent of the other Parties.

  

(b) The Purchaser may, without the obligation to obtain the prior written
consent of the Sellers, but with the obligation to provide contemporaneous or
prior notice to the Sellers, assign this Agreement or all or any part of its
rights or obligations hereunder to one or more Persons, provided, that any
assignment under this _Section 13.3(b)_ (whether by the Purchaser or any
Qualified Transferee) shall be permitted only to a Person in which the
Purchaser or Koch Industries, Inc. owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more
of such Persons outstanding equity interests (a " _Qualified Transferee_ ");
and the Purchaser (or any such Qualified Transferee, if applicable) may
pledge, assign and grant to the Purchasers (or such Qualified Transferees)
lenders, for the benefit of such lenders, a continuing security interest on
all of the Purchasers or Qualified Transferees right, title and interest in
and to this Agreement and any and all related agreements, as security for the
payment and performance of all obligations of the Purchaser or such Qualified
Transferee to such lenders by reason of borrowings or the guarantee of
borrowings, or otherwise; _provided, however_ , that any foreclosure or
assignment in lieu thereof by any such lenders shall be subject to the
restrictions on assignment or transfer set forth herein.  No such assignment
to a Qualified Transferee or pledge, grant or assignment of a security
interest shall release or discharge the Purchaser from any of its obligations
as the "Purchaser" under this Agreement or the Purchaser Ancillary Documents
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Purchaser
Ancillary Documents (including from the obligations the Purchaser otherwise
would have had under any such Ancillary Document if the Purchaser had not
assigned the obligation to enter into any such Ancillary Document to
a Qualified Transferee), and any such Qualified Transferee shall, as a
condition to assignment hereunder, expressly agree to be subject to the terms
set forth in this _Section 13.3_ and assume the obligations set forth in
_Section 8.1(d)(8)_ (with respect to the Assets received by such
Qualified Transferee).

  

(c) The Sellers may, without the obligation to obtain the prior written
consent of the Purchaser, but with the obligation to provide contemporaneous
or prior notice to the Purchaser, assign this Agreement or all or any part of
the Business or Assets, or the Sellers rights or obligations hereunder to
one or more Persons. No such assignment to a Person shall release or
discharge the Sellers from any of their obligations as the "Sellers"
under this Agreement or the Seller Ancillary Documents and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Seller Ancillary
Documents. For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers may convey any of the
Excluded Assets without any notice to or consent of the Purchaser, except as
may otherwise be required under any applicable Commercial Agreement.

  

(d) Subject to _Section 13.3(e)_ below, the Purchaser (or a Qualified
Transferee) shall have the right to assign its rights of indemnification
pursuant to _Article VIII_ and _Article XII_ to one or more subsequent owners
of all or any portion of the Assets, subject to (i) the approval of the
Sellers, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed and (ii) the requirement that, as a condition to assignment
hereunder, such assignee expressly agrees to be subject to the terms set
forth in this

        

 _Section 13.3_ and assumes the obligations set forth in _Section 8.1(d)(8)_
(with respect to the Assets received by such assignee); _provided, however_
, that for purposes of this _Section 13.3_ , any Change of Control of
the Purchaser or a Qualified Transferee shall be deemed an assignment
pursuant to this _Section 13.3(d)_ of the rights to indemnification with
respect to the Assets owned by the Purchaser or such Qualified Transferee at
the time of such Change of Control; _provided, however_ , that any change in
the ownership of Koch Industries, Inc. shall not be considered a Change of
Control of the Purchaser or any Qualified Transferee.

  

(e) Once the Purchaser (or a Qualified Transferee) has assigned its rights of
indemnification with respect to all or any portion of an Asset pursuant to
_Section 13.3(d)_ , but not _Section 13.3(b)_ , the subsequent beneficiary of
such indemnity shall have no further right to assign such indemnity again
without the prior written consent of the Sellers, which the Sellers may
withhold in their sole discretion. Further, if there is a Change of Control
of the subsequent beneficiary without such prior written consent, the
indemnification rights assigned to such subsequent beneficiary shall
thereafter cease to be enforceable by such subsequent beneficiary, but such
subsequent beneficiary shall continue to be bound by the obligations set
forth in _Section 8.1(d)(8)_ (with respect to the Assets received by
such subsequent beneficiary).

  

(f) This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and any
reference to a Party shall also be a reference to the successors and
permitted assigns thereof.

  

Section 13.4 _Captions_. The titles, captions and table of contents contained
herein are inserted herein only as a matter of convenience and for reference
and in no way define, limit, extend or describe the scope of this Agreement
or the intent of any provision hereof.

  

Section 13.5 _Controlling Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal Laws of the State
of Texas without reference to its choice of law rules.

  

Section 13.6 _Consent to Jurisdiction, Etc.; Waiver of Jury Trial_.  Each
Party hereby irrevocably agrees that any Legal Dispute shall be brought only
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Texas in Harris
County, Texas or the federal courts located in the Southern District of
Texas, and each Party hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and
of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and except for the right of removal to a federal court located in
the Southern District of Texas, irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such
court or that they any such suit, action or proceeding that is brought in any
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.  During the period a
Legal Dispute that is filed in accordance with this _Section 13.6_ is pending
before a court, all actions, suits or proceedings with respect to such Legal
Dispute or any other Legal Dispute, including any counterclaim, cross-claim
or interpleader, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
court. Each Party hereby waives, and shall not assert as a defense in any
Legal Dispute, that (a) such Party is not subject thereto, (b) such action,
suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in such

        

court, (c) such Partys property is exempt or immune from execution, (d) such
action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or (e) the
venue of such action, suit or proceeding is improper. A final judgment in
any action, suit or proceeding described in this _Section 13.6_  following
the expiration of any period permitted for appeal and subject to any stay
during appeal shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Laws.
THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE IRREVOCABLY ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO DEMAND A TRIAL BY
JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY LEGAL DISPUTE.

  

Section 13.7 _Severability_. Any provision hereof that is prohibited
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such pro­hibition or unenforceability
without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such
prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the extent
permitted by Law, each Party hereby waives any provision of Law that renders
any such provision prohibited or unenforceable in any respect. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term
or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the
court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have
the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as
so modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be
appealed.

  

Section 13.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, no one of which need be executed by all Parties but all of
which shall constitute but one and the same contract, and each of which shall
be deemed an original. It shall not be necessary in making proof of this
Agreement or the terms hereof to produce or account for more than one of such
counterparts.

  

Section 13.9 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except to the extent specified in
_Article VIII_ and _Article XII_, which are also intended to benefit and
to be enforceable by any Indemnified Party, the rights, duties, and
obligations under this Agreement are for the sole benefit of the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, and are for the benefit of
no other Person or Persons, and no rights will accrue to or arise for any
other Person or Persons as a result of the express or implied terms,
conditions, rights, duties, or obligations of, or set forth in, this
Agreement. The obligations of the Sellers set forth in this Agreement are
joint and several and the Sellers agree to be jointly and severally liable
for the respective obligations of one another set forth in this Agreement,
and HI agrees to be jointly and severally liable for any obligations of any
Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller set forth in any Ancillary Agreement.

  

Section 13.10 _Amendment; Waivers; Extensions_. No amendment, modification,
waiver, replacement, termination or cancellation of any provision of this
Agreement will be valid, unless the same is in writing and signed by the
Parties. Each waiver of a right hereunder does not extend beyond the specific
event or circumstance giving rise to the right. No waiver by any Party of any
default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, may be deemed to extend to any prior or
subsequent default,

        

misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in
any way any rights arising because of any prior or subsequent such
occurrence. Neither the failure nor any delay on the part of any Party to
exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement will operate as a waiver
thereof, nor does any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy
preclude any other or further exercise of the same or of any other right or
remedy.

  

Section 13.11 _Integration_. This Agreement and the documents
executed pursuant hereto supersede all negotiations, agreements and
understandings among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
(except for the Confidentiality Agreement), and constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect thereto.

  

Section 13.12 _Transaction Costs_. Except as provided for in _Sections
6.4(b)_,  _6.4(d)_ , _6.5(a)_ , _6.5(b)_ , _6.10(b)_ and _Articles VII_ , 
_VIII_ and _XII_ , (a) the Purchaser shall pay its own fees, costs
and expenses incurred in connection herewith and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the fees, costs and expenses of its financial
advisors, environmental consultants, accountants and counsel, and (b) the
Sellers shall pay their own fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection
herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the fees, costs
and expenses of their financial advisors, accountants and counsel.
