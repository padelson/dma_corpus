ARTICLE II

  



  

 _THE MERGER_

  



  

Section 2.01 _The Merger_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the "Merger")
with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the
separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be
the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

  



  

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 as soon as
possible, but in any event no later than five Business Days after the date
the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction
or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those

  



  

  



    



    

 13

 



    

conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible,
waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or
at such other place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and
the Company may mutually agree. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to herein as the "Closing Date".

  



  

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a
certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other
filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger.
The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the
certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or
at such later time as may be specified in the certificate of merger).

  



  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

  



  

Section 2.02 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the
Company or the holders of any shares of Company Stock or any shares of
capital stock of Parent or Merger Subsidiary:

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.02(b)_ , _Section 2.02(c)_ ,
_Section 2.04_ or _Section 2.05_ , each share of Company Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive $33.50 in cash, without interest (such per share amount,
the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in
accordance with _Section 2.03_ , without interest.

  



  

(b) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or
owned by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  



  

(c) Each share of Company Stock held by any Subsidiary of either the Company
or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  



  

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and, except as provided in _Section
2.02(c)_ , shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Section 2.03 _Surrender and Payment_.

  



  

  



    



    

 14

 



    

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of
exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares
of Company Stock (the "Certificates") if any or (ii) uncertificated shares of
Company Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"). Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration to
be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Such
funds may be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_
that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger
Consideration payable hereunder and following any losses Parent shall promptly
provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the
stockholders of the Company in the amount of any such losses and (ii) such
investments shall only be in short-term obligations of the United States of
America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United
States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Standard and Poor's Corporation or Moody's Investors Service, Inc.,
respectively. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be
payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs.
Promptly after the Effective Time (but not later than two Business Days
thereafter), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to
each holder of shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of
transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange
Agent) for use in such exchange, as applicable.

  



  

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a
properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an
"agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect
of the Company Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share.
Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate
or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all
purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

  



  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,

  



  

  



    



    

 15

 



    

Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth, in this Article 2.

  



  

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Stock
twelve months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon
demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock for
the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.03_ prior to that
time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of such shares without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of
shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Laws. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock two years
after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such
time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate in
good faith to establish customary procedures with the Exchange Agent with
respect to the prompt transmission to the Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or
its nominee of immediately available funds of an aggregate amount of Merger
Consideration with respect to the number of shares of Company Stock held of
record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 2.04 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding  _Section 2.02_ , shares of
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with
Delaware Law shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, unless and until such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise
loses the right to appraisal, such shares shall be treated as if they had
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent or as required by Applicable Law, the Company shall not
make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such
demands.

  



  

Section 2.05 _Company Stock Awards_.

  



  

(a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase
shares of Company Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option") that is then-
outstanding under the Company Stock Plan, whether or not vested or
exercisable, shall,

  



  

  



    



    

 16

 



    

automatically and without any action on behalf of the holder thereof, be
canceled, and the Company shall pay each holder of such Company Stock Option
for each such Company Stock Option an amount in cash determined by
multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable exercise price of such Company Stock Option by (ii) the number of
shares of Company Stock underlying such Company Stock Option (assuming
full vesting of the Company Stock Option) had such holder exercised the
Company Stock Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit
award relating to shares of Company Stock (other than a Company Performance
Share), whether settled in cash or in stock (each, a "Company RSU"), that is
then-outstanding under the Company Stock Plan and unvested, automatically and
without any action on behalf of the holder or beneficiary thereof, shall be
converted to a deferred cash award in an amount equal to the product of the
Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Company Stock represented by
such Company RSU (the "RSU Consideration"). The RSU Consideration shall
continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions of the Company RSU
award as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be paid
solely in cash in accordance with the vesting and payment schedule applicable
to the Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , the RSU Consideration shall vest and become payable upon the
Company RSU holder's Involuntary Termination. For the avoidance of doubt, a
Director Stock Deferral (as defined in the Chemtura Corporation Amended and
Restated Non-Employee Directors Plan) is a Company RSU for all purposes under
this Agreement.

  



  

(c) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is
then-outstanding under the Company Stock Plan and vested (but for which the
underlying shares of Company Stock have not yet been delivered),
automatically and without any action on behalf of the holder or
beneficiary thereof, shall be canceled, and the Company shall pay the holder
of any such Company RSU an amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger
Consideration and the number of shares of Company Stock represented by such
Company RSU.

  



  

(d) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each performance share
award relating to shares of Company Stock, whether settled in cash or in stock
(each, a "Company Performance Share"), that is then-outstanding under the
Company Stock Plan, and for which the applicable performance period has not
ended, automatically and without any action on behalf of the holder or
beneficiary thereof, shall be converted to a deferred cash award in an amount
equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of
Company Stock represented by such Company Performance Share, which number
shall be determined based on the target performance level (the "PS
Consideration"). The PS Consideration shall continue to be subject to the
same terms and conditions of the Company Performance Share award as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be paid solely in cash in
accordance with the vesting and payment schedule applicable to the Company
Performance Share immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , the PS
Consideration shall vest and become payable upon the Company Performance
Share holder's Involuntary Termination.

  



  

    



    

 17

 



    

(e) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Performance
Share that is then-outstanding under the Company Stock Plan and for which the
applicable performance period has ended (but for which the underlying shares
of Company Stock have not yet been delivered), automatically and without any
action on behalf of the holder or beneficiary thereof, shall be canceled, and
the Company shall pay the holder of any such Company Performance Share an
amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number
of shares of Company Stock represented by such Company Performance Share,
which number shall be determined based on actual performance as of the end of
the applicable performance period.

  



  

At the Effective Time, each long-term cash award set forth on _Section
2.05(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each, a "Cash Award") that is
then-outstanding and unvested, shall continue as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ , the Cash Award shall vest and become

immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Cash Award that is then-
outstanding and vested (but for which the cash has not yet been paid) shall be
canceled, and the Company shall pay the holder of any such Cash Award an
amount in cash equal to the face amount of such Cash Award.

  



  

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to make any amendments to the terms of (and use reasonable best efforts to
obtain any necessary consents under) any outstanding Company Stock Option,
Company RSU, Company Performance Share or Cash Award (collectively,
the "Company Equity Awards") to give effect to the transactions contemplated
by this _Section 2.05_ and to ensure that from and after the Effective Time
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver
Company Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any person pursuant to
or in settlement of Company Equity Awards. All payments under this _Section
2.05_ shall be made at or as soon as practicable following the contemplated
payment date (and in all events not later than 60 days after the contemplated
payment date), pursuant to the Company's ordinary payroll practices, and
shall be subject to any applicable withholding; _provided_ that any payments
that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of
the Code and that cannot be paid on the contemplated payment date without
triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code shall be made on
the earliest date thereafter that will not trigger such Tax or penalty.

  



  

Section 2.06 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, or any stock dividend thereon
with a record date during such period, but excluding any change that results
from any exercise of Company Stock Options or the settlement of Company RSUs
or Company Performance Shares, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted. Nothing
in this _Section 2.06_ shall be construed to permit any party to take any
action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of
this Agreement.

Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any
Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision
of Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds
amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which the Exchange Agent, the
Company, the Company's Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

  



  

Section 2.08 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this Article 2.

understood that nothing in this _Section 6.03_ is intended to expand any

pursuant to _Section 8.01_ beyond as provided in _Section 8.01_ ).

  



  

Section 6.04 _No Solicitation; Other Offers_.

to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall not release or waive any
"standstill" provision or agreement to which it is a party; _provided_ ,
that, if the Company is in compliance with this _Section 6.04_ , the Company
may release or waive any "standstill" provision or agreement to which it is a
party for a Third Party who has indicated to the Company its desire to make
an unsolicited non-public bona fide Acquisition Proposal to the Company
that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably believes may lead to a
Superior Proposal but which Third Party is unable to do so because of such
"standstill" provision or agreement, solely to the extent necessary to permit
the counterparty to such "standstill" provision or agreement to make an
unsolicited non-public Acquisition Proposal to the Company, if, prior to such
release or waiver, the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith
after consultation with its outside legal counsel that failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to violate the directors'
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company shall advise Parent orally and in writing no later than 24 hours
after any such release or waiver and the Company shall promptly provide such
release or waiver. Subject to _Section 6.04(b)_ and _Section 6.04(c)_ , on
the date hereof, the Company shall, and shall cause any of its Subsidiaries
and its and their Representatives to cease immediately and cause to be
terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if

conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Promptly (but in any event within two Business Days) after the date hereof,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished in connection therewith and
immediately terminate all physical and electronic "data room" access
previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 6.04(a)_ to the contrary,
if at any time after the date hereof and prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their Representatives has received a _bona fide_ written, unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably
believes may lead to a Superior Proposal; (ii) the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
violate the directors' fiduciary duties under Applicable Law,

  



  

  



    



    

 50

 



    

then the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (1)
engage in negotiations or discussions with such Third Party and its
Representatives or financing sources or (2) furnish to such Third Party or
its Representatives or financing sources non-public information relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that the Company shall promptly (but in
any event, within 24 hours) provide or make available to Parent any such
information that is provided to any such Person which was not
previously provided to or made available to Parent (including, when executed,
a copy of such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement); or (iii) take any
nonappealable, final action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders
the Company to take.

  



  

(c) In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company or the
Board of Directors of the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the 1934 Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or
exchange offer), (ii) making any legally required disclosure to stockholders
with regard to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or an
Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that in the case of clauses (i) and (ii)

Proposal unless permitted by _Section 6.04(e)_ ), (iii) issuing a "stop, look
and listen" disclosure or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act or (iv) contacting and engaging in
discussions with any person or group and their respective Representatives who
has made an Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in breach of this
_Section 6.04_ solely for the purpose of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal
and the terms thereof.

  



  

(d) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the actions
referred to in _Section 6.04(b)_ unless the Company shall have delivered to
Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such
action. In addition, after the date hereof and prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (and, in any
event, within 24 hours) after (i) receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Third Party that is considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include the material terms and
conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request (including
if the Acquisition Proposal is in writing by providing copies of any material
amendments or other material documents thereto) and (ii) any material change
(including any change as to price) in a previously notified Acquisition
Proposal. The Company hereby agrees that after the date hereof it shall
not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, enter into any agreement that
prohibits or restricts it from providing to Parent the information
contemplated by this _Section 6.04(d)_ or complying with _Section 6.04(e)_.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to compliance with clause (a) of this _Section 6.04_ , prior to,
but not after, the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the
Company's Board

  



  

  



    



    

 51

 



    

of Directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change that is the result of
a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, if the Company's Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to violate the
directors' fiduciary duties under Applicable Law and, in the event of such an
Adverse Recommendation Change that is a result of a Superior Proposal, the
Company's Board of Directors may also take action pursuant to _Section
10.01(d)(i)_ of this Agreement in connection with accepting a Superior
Proposal as contemplated herein; _provided_ , that prior to any Adverse
Recommendation Change or action pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)(i)_ of this
Agreement:

  



  

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, at least four Business Days in advance of its intention to
effect a Adverse Recommendation Change or to take action pursuant to _Section
10.01(d)(i)_ , which notice, if the intended Adverse Recommendation Change is
not the result of a Superior Proposal, shall specify in reasonable detail the
reasons for such Adverse Recommendation Change (including a reasonably
detailed description of the Intervening Event) and, if concerning an intended
Adverse Recommendation Change that is the result of a Superior Proposal,
shall specify the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and the
material terms thereof;

  



  

(ii) after providing such notice and prior to effecting such Adverse
Recommendation Change or taking such action pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)(i)_
, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with
Parent and Merger Subsidiary in good faith (if and to the extent Parent and
Merger Subsidiary indicate to the Company their desire to negotiate) to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
permit the Company not to effect a Adverse Recommendation Change or take such
action pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)(i)_ in response to such a Superior
Proposal; and

  



  

(iii) the Company's Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith
any changes to this Agreement offered in writing by Parent (and not
revoked) during or prior to such four Business Day period and (x) if the
intended Adverse Recommendation Change or the action pursuant to _Section
10.01(d)(i)_ is the result of a Superior Proposal, shall have determined in
good faith after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal if such changes were to be given effect and that failure to
effect a Adverse Recommendation Change or take the action pursuant to
_Section 10.01(d)(i)_ would reasonably be expected to violate the directors'
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, as the case may be, and (y) if the
intended Adverse Recommendation Change is the result of an Intervening Event
and not the result of a Superior Proposal, shall have determined in good
faith after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal
counsel

  



  

  



    



    

 52

 



    

that failure to effect a Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be
expected to violate the directors' fiduciary duties under Applicable Law if
such changes were to be given effect;

  



  

 _provided_ , that, if the intended Adverse Recommendation Change is the
result of a Superior Proposal or in the case of an action pursuant to _Section
10.01(d)(i)_ , in the event of any material revision to such Superior
Proposal, including any revision to price, the Company shall be required to
deliver a new written notice to Parent and Merger Subsidiary and to comply
with the requirements of this _Section 6.04(e)_ with respect to such new
written notice; _provided_ that in connection with each new notice
contemplated by this section, each reference to the four Business Day period
in this _Section 6.04(e)_ shall be deemed to be a three Business Day period.
For the avoidance of doubt, all information provided to Parent pursuant to
this _Section 6.04_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior
to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company's Board
of Directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change, otherwise in
compliance with this _Section 6.04(e)_ , only in response to (A) the Company
receiving an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal and not involving a material and willful
breach of this _Section 6.04(e)_ of this Agreement or (B) an
Intervening Event.

  



  

(f) As used in this Agreement:

  



  

(i) "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a confidentiality agreement
(i) in effect on the date hereof or (ii) that contains provisions that are no
less favorable in the aggregate (including non-disclosure provisions that are
no less favorable in the aggregate) to the Company than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that such confidentiality agreement
may contain a less restrictive or no standstill restriction.

  



  

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means a _bona fide_ , written Acquisition Proposal
for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Stock or all or
substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith by a majority vote, after considering the advice of a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, (A)
are more favorable to the Company's stockholders than as provided hereunder,
taking into account all relevant factors (including the timing, likelihood of
consummation, ability to finance, regulatory and other similarly relevant
aspects of such proposal), and any adjustment or revisions made by Parent in
writing (and not revoked) in response to such Acquisition Proposal, and (B)
would result in the owners of the capital stock of the Company as of
immediately prior to the consummation of the transaction contemplated by such
Acquisition Proposal, collectively, owning less than a majority of the

  



  

  



    



    

 53

 



    

capital stock of the acquirer or resulting entity in such transaction
immediately after such consummation.

dated as of June 10, 2013, among the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company
party thereto as guarantors (the "Guarantors") and Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as the trustee (in such capacity, the "Trustee"), as
amended and restated by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July
23, 2013, among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee (as amended and
restated, the "Existing Indenture") in order to effect a redemption no
earlier than the Closing Date of the Existing Notes, pursuant to the terms of
the Existing Indenture (the "Redemption") and (2) provide any other
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent (which shall not require any
payment by the Company or its Subsidiaries) to facilitate the redemption of
the Existing Notes no earlier than the Closing

  



  

  



    



    

 58

 



    

Date (but in all events no earlier than the Effective Time). The Company
shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
each of the notices and other documents contemplated by this _Section
6.05(b)_ reasonably in advance of their delivery and, after consultation with
Parent with respect to any such comments, shall accept such comments that are
not unreasonable. Any such Redemption pursuant to this _Section 6.05(b) _
shall be conditioned on the Closing having occurred (or occurring
concurrently) and shall be conducted in accordance with the Existing
Indenture and Applicable Law.

  



  

(c) If requested in writing by Parent, (i) the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take such further actions as necessary in order to
satisfy and discharge the Existing Notes no earlier than the Closing Date
(but in all events no earlier than the Effective Time) (the "Satisfaction and
Discharge"), (ii) the Company shall deliver an officer's certificate of the
Company and use its reasonable best efforts to deliver an opinion of the
Company's counsel, in each case, in accordance with the Existing Indenture,
to effect the Satisfaction and Discharge and (iii) the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide any other cooperation reasonably requested
by Parent (which shall not require any payment by the Company or its
Subsidiaries but may include sending notices related to such Satisfaction and
Discharge to the Trustee and holders of Notes) to facilitate the Satisfaction
and Discharge. Upon completion of the Satisfaction and Discharge (which for
the avoidance of doubt, will take place no earlier than the Closing Date),
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Trustee to
promptly deliver to the Company and Parent an acknowledgement that the
Satisfaction and Discharge has been completed. The Company shall provide
Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on each of the
notices and other documents contemplated by this _Section 6.05(c)_ reasonably
in advance of delivery and, after consultation with Parent with respect to
any such comments, shall accept such comments that are not unreasonable. Any
such Satisfaction and Discharge pursuant to this _Section 6.05(c)_ shall be
conditioned on the Closing having occurred (or occurring concurrently) and
shall be conducted in accordance with the Existing Indenture and Applicable
Law.

  



  

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of any written
request by Parent to do so, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to commence offers to purchase (including any Change of Control Offer (as
defined in the Existing Indenture)), redeem or exchange, and to
conduct consent solicitations related to any or all of the Existing Notes, on
such terms and conditions, including pricing terms and amendments to the
terms and provisions of the Existing Indenture, that are specified and
requested, from time to time, by Parent and each of which shall be
conditioned on, and effective only at or after, the Closing Date (but in all
events no earlier than the Effective Time) (each, a "Debt Tender Offer" and
collectively, the "Debt Tender Offers"); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
Company may be required to enter into a supplemental indenture prior to the
Closing that is only operative at or after the Closing. The Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct its and its
Subsidiaries respective Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to
provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with
the Debt Tender Offers, including using reasonable best efforts to provide
customary information to Parent to

  



  

  



    



    

 59

 



    

allow Parent to prepare the required offers to purchase, consent solicitation
statements, letters of transmittal, supplemental indentures and/or forms of
consent and other related documentation. The dealer manager, solicitation
agent, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection
with the Debt Tender Offers shall be selected by Parent. The Company shall
(i) waive any of the conditions to the Debt Tender Offers and make any
change to the Debt Tender Offers, as may be reasonably requested by Parent
(other than any condition related to the occurrence of the Closing or to
require effectiveness prior to Closing) and (ii) if reasonably requested in
writing by Parent, extend the offer period and consent period applicable to a
Debt Tender Offer to a date selected by Parent. Parent shall provide the
Company with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the notices
and other documents delivered in connection with any Debt Tender Offer
reasonably in advance of their delivery and, after consultation with the
Company with respect to any such comments, accept any such comments that are
not unreasonable. Without the written consent of Parent, the Company shall not
waive any condition to any Debt Tender Offers or make any changes to any Debt
Tender Offer ( _provided_ that the Company shall take such actions as it
reasonably determines are necessary or advisable to comply with the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Term Credit Facility, the Existing
Notes and Applicable Law).

  



  

(e) If requested in writing by Parent, as soon as reasonably practicable
after such request, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
use reasonable best efforts to assist, support and cooperate with Parent,
including by making introductions, providing advice and information and, if
requested by Parent, attending meetings, to allow Parent to seek an amendment
to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, on behalf of the Company (the
"Revolver Amendment"), in order to obtain consent to the Merger and the other
transactions hereunder and to effect amendments to the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility immediately prior to, and conditional on, the Closing such
that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not
constitute or result in a breach, default, event of default or other similar
event or circumstance thereunder (whether as a result of a change of control
or otherwise); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company and its
Subsidiaries that are guarantors of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility may
be required to enter into such amendment prior to the Closing, it being
understood that the Closing shall be a condition to the effectiveness of such
amendment. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and
shall instruct its and their respective Representatives to, use reasonable
best efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the Revolver Amendment. Parent shall draft documentation
associated with the Revolver Amendment and shall provide the Company with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Revolver Amendment and
any documentation related thereto reasonably in advance of delivery and,
after consultation with the Company with respect to any such comments, to
accept any such comments that are not unreasonable.

  



  

(f) The Company hereby consents to the reasonable and customary use of its
and its Subsidiaries' trademarks, service marks and logos in connection with
the Financing; _provided_ that such trademarks, service marks and logos are
used in a manner that (1) is consistent with the manner in which the Company
has used its trademarks, service marks and logos in connection with past
financings and (2) is

  



  

  



    



    

 60

 



    

not intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or its
Subsidiaries (it being understood that any such use of such trademarks,
service marks and logos shall fall within fair use principles under
Applicable Law and nothing herein shall be construed as a trademark license in
respect of such use).

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.05_ , until
the Effective Time, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any
of their respective Representatives shall:

  



  

(i) unless funded in advance by Parent, be required to pay any commitment or
other similar fees under the Financing, the Revolver Amendment, the
Redemption or Satisfaction and Discharge or any Debt Tender Offers;

  



  

(ii) be required to enter into any definitive agreement (other than the
supplemental indentures, amendments, and redemption documents described above
as to be entered into prior to the Closing) or have any liability or any
obligation under any certificate, document, instrument, credit agreement or
any related document or any other agreement or document related to the
Financing (other than the authorization letters described in clause (a)(vi)
above); or

  



  

(iii) unless promptly reimbursed by Parent, be required to incur any other
fees or expenses in connection with the Financing, the Revolver Amendment, the
Redemption or Satisfaction and Discharge or any Debt Tender Offers.

  



  

(h) Parent shall (i) promptly, upon written request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (including
reasonable attorneys', accountants, consultants, agents, investment banks and
other representative's costs and fees) incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with their respective obligations pursuant to, and
in accordance with, this _Section 6.05_ , and (ii) indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against all damages, losses, liabilities or reasonable costs and
reasonable expenses suffered or reasonably incurred by any of them in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing, the Revolver Amendment, the
Satisfaction and Discharge, any Debt Tender Offers, any information used in
connection therewith (other than information provided by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) and all other actions taken by the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives pursuant to
this _Section 6.05_ , except to the extent such damages, losses, costs,
Liabilities or expenses are determined by a final, non-appealable judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen out of or resulted from
the material breach of this _Section 6.05_ by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or willful misconduct of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed
that the Company shall promptly repay to Parent any amounts reimbursed or
indemnified by Parent in favor of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives if it is finally determined as aforesaid that

  



  

  



    



    

 61

 



    

the Company would not be entitled to indemnification for such amounts
pursuant to this sentence.

  



  

(i) Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge and agree that neither the
obtaining nor the consummation of any of the Financing, the Revolver Amendment
or any Debt Tender Offer is a condition to the Closing. For the avoidance of
doubt, if any of the Financing, the Revolver Amendment, the Redemption or
Satisfaction and Discharge or any Debt Tender Offer has not been obtained or
consummated prior to the Closing, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall continue
to be obligated, subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article 9 (including  _Section 9.02(b)_ with respect to the Company
not having breached or failed to perform in all material respects any of
its obligations under clauses (a)-(h) of this _Section 6.05_ ), to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions to occur at the Closing in accordance
with this Agreement (it being understood that nothing in this _Section
6.05(i)_ shall be construed to operate as a waiver of any breach by the
Company of any of the covenants in this _Section 6.05_ or the conditions
set forth in _Section 9.02(b)_ ).

  



  

Section 6.06 _Director Resignations_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent written resignations
executed by each director of the Company in office immediately prior to the
Effective Time, which resignations shall be effective at the Effective Time
and which resignations shall not have been revoked.

  



  

Section 6.07 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and the Company's Board of Directors shall use its reasonable best
efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

  



  

Section 6.08 _Stock Exchange De-listing; 1934 Act Deregistration_. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under Applicable Law and rules and policies of the
NYSE, Euronext and SEC to enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation
of the Company Stock from the NYSE and Euronext and the deregistration of the
Company Stock under the 1934 Act as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time.

  



  

Section 6.09 _Certain Integration Matters_. From the date hereof until the
Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law, the Company shall cooperate in
all reasonable respects with Parent in its planning to integrate the
activities, business, operations, personnel, policies and programs of
the Company and its Subsidiaries with those of Parent and its Affiliates.

ARTICLE VII

  



  

 _COVENANTS OF PARENT_

  



  

Parent agrees that:

  



  

Section 7.01 _Conduct of Parent_. Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
take any action that is intended to, individually or in the aggregate,
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the ability of Parent
and Merger Subsidiary to consummate the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing;  _provided_ , that
this _Section 7.01_ shall not limit or restrict Parent from exercising any of
its rights under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.02 _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary_ _._

  



  

(a) Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

(b) In the event that this Agreement has not been adopted by the sole
stockholder of Merger Subsidiary at the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, as promptly as practicable after such execution and delivery,
Parent, as sole stockholder of Merger Subsidiary, shall take action by written
consent to adopt this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.03 _Voting of Shares_. Parent shall vote all shares of Company
Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of adoption
of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

  



  

Section 7.04 _Director and Officer Liability_. Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees to,
do the following:

  



  

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers
and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified
Person") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law or any other
Applicable Law and provided under the Company's certificate of incorporation
or bylaws in effect on the date hereof. In the event of any threatened or
pending claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or informal
(each, a "Proceeding") to which an Indemnified Person is a party or with
respect to which an Indemnified Person is otherwise involved (including as a
witness), arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining in whole or in part
to the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was an officer, director,
employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is
or was serving at the request of the Company as such for another enterprise
(including any Proceeding arising out of or pertaining to matters occurring
or existing or alleged to have occurred or existed, or acts or omissions
occurring or alleged

  



  

  



    



    

 63

 



    

to have occurred, at or prior to the Effective Time, or arising out of or
pertaining to this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby), (x) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
advance fees, costs and expenses (including such reasonable attorney's fees
and disbursements whether or not Parent elects to control the defense of any
relevant Proceeding) incurred by each Indemnified Person in connection with
and prior to the final disposition of such Proceedings, such fees, costs and
expenses (including such reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements) to be
advanced within ten Business Days of receipt by Parent from the Indemnified
Person of a request therefor; _provided_ that any person to whom expenses are
advanced provides a written undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such person is
not entitled to indemnification and (y) Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter. In the event any claim for
indemnification is asserted or made by any Indemnified Person pursuant to
this _Section 7.04_ , any determination required to be made with respect to
whether such Indemnified Person's conduct complies with the standards under
Delaware Law and other Applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation's
certificate of incorporation or bylaws shall be made by an appropriate court
or tribunal (it being understood and agreed that the burden of proof shall be
on Parent and the Surviving Corporation to establish that such Indemnified
Person did not so comply). In the event any Proceeding is brought against any
Indemnified Person and in which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Person under this _Section 7.04_ , (i) the Surviving Corporation
shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time,
(ii) each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her
own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control
the defense of any such Proceeding, and (iii) no Indemnified Person shall be
liable for any settlement effected without his or her prior express written
consent.

  



  

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers and directors and advancement of
expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the
corresponding provisions in existence on the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and comply with their
respective obligations under any indemnification agreement with any
Indemnified Person, and not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
agreement in any manner that would adversely affect any right of any
Indemnified Person thereunder.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable
extended reporting or discovery period for the Company's existing
directors' and officers' insurance policies and the Company's existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in
each case for a claims reporting or discovery period

  



  

  



    



    

 64

 



    

of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective
Time (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time)
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable
than the coverage provided under the Company's existing policies with respect
to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act,
omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her
serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided _ that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to
such "tail" insurance of more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most
recently paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement,
which amount is set forth in _Section 7.04(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, (the "Maximum Amount"). If the Company or the Surviving Corporation
for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at
least six years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place
as of the date hereof with the Company's current insurance carrier or with an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable
than the coverage provided under the Company's existing policies as of the
date hereof; _provided_  that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence
an annual premium amount in excess of the Maximum Amount; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such
amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to
the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if an Indemnified Person
is a party to or is otherwise involved (including as a witness) in any
Proceeding (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) on or
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this
_Section 7.04_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
Proceeding.

  



  

(f) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.04._

  



  

(g) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Sectio _n 7.04_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Delaware Law

  



  

  



    



    

 65

 



    

or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive
consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

  



  

Section 7.05 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company and
its Subsidiaries) to, provide to each Company Employee who is employed
immediately prior to the Closing and who remains in the employ of Parent, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing (each such individual, a
"Continuing Employee") (i) for a period of 24 months following the Closing
Date, a base salary or wage rate and annual target bonus opportunity that are
no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate and annual target bonus
opportunity pursuant to the Management Incentive Plan or Sales Incentive
Plan, as applicable to which such Continuing Employee was entitled immediately
prior to the Closing and (ii) for a period of 12 months following the Closing
Date, with employee benefits (excluding other short term and long term cash
or equity incentives) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to
those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing.

  



  

(b) For a period of 24 months following the Closing, Parent shall maintain
the employee severance protections set forth in _Section 7.05(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company and
its Subsidiaries) to, use reasonable best efforts to cause any employee
benefit plans established, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any of
its Affiliates that cover any of the Continuing Employees following the
Closing (collectively, the "Parent Plans") to (i) recognize the pre-Closing
service of participating Continuing Employees with the Company for all
purposes of vesting, eligibility and benefit entitlement (other than for
benefit accrual purposes under defined benefit pension plans and retiree
medical plans), except to the extent such service credit would result in a
duplication of benefits for the same period, (ii) waive any pre-existing
condition limitations for participating Continuing Employees to the same
extent waived under analogous Company Employee Plans and (iii) provide credit
to each participating Continuing Employee under the applicable Parent Plan
for amounts paid by the Continuing Employee prior to the Closing during the
year in which the Closing occurs under any analogous Company Employee Plan
during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and
out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance
with the terms of such Parent Plan.

  



  

(d) Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to continue to credit
under any applicable Parent Plans each Continuing Employee for all vacation
and personal holiday pay that such Continuing Employee is entitled to use but
has not used as of the Closing to the extent reflected in the books and
records of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise disclosed to Parent.

  



  

  



    



    

 66

 



    

(e) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall take all
actions necessary or required under the Company's 2012 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") to, (i) ensure that no offering period, except for
the offering period in effect under the ESPP on the date of this Agreement
and any offering period that commences prior to January 1, 2017 under the
terms of the ESPP as in effect as of the date hereof, shall be authorized or
commenced on or after the date of this Agreement and (ii) contingent on the
Effective Time, with respect to the offering period, if any, in effect under
the ESPP that is scheduled to end on or after the Closing Date, establish a
date (which date shall be not later than five Business Days prior to the
Closing Date) as the final purchase date under the ESPP. The Company shall
cause the amount credited to each participant's account under the ESPP
on such final purchase date to be applied to purchase the number of shares of
Company Stock that could be purchased with such amount on such date pursuant
to the ESPP. The Company shall terminate the ESPP in its entirety effective as
of the Effective Time, contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions (including, in
appropriate, amending the terms of the ESPP) that are necessary to give
effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section 7.05(e)._

  



  

(f) With respect to the performance period in effect under the Company's
Management Incentive Plan and Sales Incentive Plan as of the Closing Date, the
Company shall pay to each participant in each such plan (on or as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date) the pro-rata portion of the amount that
would have been earned by such participant for such performance period, based
on performance achieved through the Closing Date, as determined by the
Company in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. In
addition, if the Closing Date occurs after the end of a performance period
under the Company's Management Incentive Plan or Sales Incentive Plan
and prior to the date on which the payments for such performance period are
made under such plan, Parent shall make a payment for such performance period
to each participant in such plan in an amount determined in accordance with
the terms of such plan in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice as soon as practicable following the completion of the Company's
audited consolidated financial statements for the year of such performance
period based on the achievement of the applicable performance goals;
_provided_ that Parent shall not exercise any discretionary authority under
such plan to reduce the amount of such payment.

  



  

(g) With respect to the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, the
Company shall make a profit sharing contribution to the account of each
participant in the Company's Employee Savings Plan and Supplemental Savings
Plan (each, a "Savings Plan") , as applicable, in an amount equal to the pro-
rata portion of the amount of the profit sharing contribution that would have
been made for such participant under such Savings Plan for such year, based
on performance achieved through the Closing Date, as determined by the
Company. In addition, if the Closing Date occurs after the end of a calendar
year and prior to the date on which profit sharing contributions for
such calendar year are made to a Savings Plan, Parent shall make a profit
sharing contribution to the account of each participant in such Savings Plan
as soon as practicable following the completion of the Company's audited
consolidated financial statements for such calendar year in an amount
determined based on the achievement of the applicable

  



  

  



    



    

 67

 



    

performance goals. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
and contingent on the occurrence of the Closing, the Company shall terminate
(or cause to be terminated) all Company Employee Plans that are intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and include a cash or deferred
arrangement (a "Company 401(k) Plan") (unless Parent provides written notice
to the Company no later than 15 Business Days prior to the Effective Time
that any such Company 401(k) Plan shall not be terminated). Unless Parent
provides such written notice to the Company, and in no event later than three
Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide Parent
with evidence that such Company 401(k) Plan(s) have been terminated
(effective no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time and
contingent on the Closing) pursuant to resolutions of the Company's Board of
Directors. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to
reasonable review by Parent. In the event of such termination, Parent agrees
to cause a 401(k) plan sponsored by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries to
accept a "direct rollover" from such Company 401(k) Plan of the account
balances (including promissory notes evidencing all outstanding loans) of all
Continuing Employees if such rollover is elected in accordance with
Applicable Law by a Continuing Employee. The parties shall cooperate to take
whatever actions are necessary to permit each participant in the Company
401(k) Plan who has an outstanding loan balance under the Company 401(k)
Plan on the date the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated to continue to make
loan payments to the Company 401(k) Plan pending the distribution and
rollover of his or her account, as described in the previous sentence.

  



  

(h) The Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, comply with any required notice to, or engage in any required
consultation with, any labor union, works council or other labor
organization, pursuant to any Collective Bargaining Agreement to which any of
the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound, or pursuant to
Applicable Law. The parties agree to work together in good faith to
consult with or obtain the consent of any labor or trade union, works council

refrain from any act, to the extent such commitment, divestiture, license,
hold separate, arrangement, termination, modification or action or refraining

_Section 2.02_ or _Section 2.05_ in excess of a _de minimis_ amount) as of
the Closing Date with the same force and effect as if made on and as of such

and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement, other than those
specified in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), shall be true and
correct (disregarding all materiality and Company Material Adverse Effect
qualifications and exceptions contained therein) on and as of the Closing
Date with the same force and effect as if made on and as of such date (except
for representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date or
time, which representations and warranties shall have been true and correct as
of such date and time) except for any failure to be so true and correct which
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

  



  

(b) the Company shall not have breached or failed to perform in all material
respects all of its obligations under this Agreement contemplated to be
performed prior to the Effective Time;

  



  

  



    



    

 78

 



    

(c) Since the date hereof and prior to the Closing there shall not have
occurred any change, effect, event, development, occurrence, circumstance or
state of facts that has had or would reasonably be expected to have,

(d) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a certificate signed by an

(a) The representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Subsidiary set
forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct (disregarding all
materiality and Parent Material Adverse Effect qualifications and exceptions
contained therein) as of the date hereof and on and as of the Closing Date
with the same force and effect as if made on and as of such date (except for
representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date or time,

(b) Parent shall not have breached or failed to perform in all material
respects all of its obligations under this Agreement contemplated to be

Section 9.04 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. Neither the Company nor
Parent may rely, either as a basis for not consummating the Merger or
terminating this Agreement and abandoning the Merger, on the failure of any
conditions set forth in _Section 9.01_ , _Section 9.02_ or  _Section 9.03_ ,
as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such party's
breach in any material respect of any provision of this Agreement or failure
in any material respect to use the standard of efforts required from
such party to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| by either the Company or Parent, if: 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before September 25, 2017, (
_provided_ , that, if on such date the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Section 9.01(b)_ , _9.01(c)_ , _9.01(d)_ , or _9.01(e)_ shall not have been
satisfied but all other conditions to Closing shall have been satisfied (or
in the case of conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, shall be capable of being satisfied on such date) or waived by all
parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, then, at the written
election of the Company or Parent, each in its sole discretion, such date may
be extended to December 22, 2017) (such date, as it may be extended in
accordance with the proviso above and subject to _Section 11.03_ , the "End
Date");  _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 10.01(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any party if the failure
of the Merger to have been consummated on or before the applicable End Date
was primarily due to the material breach of the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement;

  



  

(ii) there shall be any permanent injunction or other order issued by any
court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition
preventing the consummation of the Merger and such injunction or other order

Change shall have occurred;

  



  

(ii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement

Date or (y) otherwise, shall not have been cured (if curable) by the earlier
of 30 calendar days after delivery of notice of such breach in writing and the
End Date and, in each case, that would cause the conditions set forth in
_Section 9.02(a)_ or _Section 9.02(b)_ not to be satisfied; or

  



  

(iii) prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, a willful and material
breach by the Company of a covenant or agreement set forth in _Section

 80

(i) (1) prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Board of Directors of
the Company authorizes the Company to enter into a binding, definitive
written acquisition agreement providing for a Superior Proposal, (2)
immediately prior to or concurrently with the termination of this Agreement
(and prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting), the Company enters into such
binding definitive acquisition agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal
and (3) the Company immediately prior to such termination pays to Parent in
immediately available funds the fee required to be paid pursuant to _Section
11.04(b)(i)_ ; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.01(d)(i)_ with respect
to any Superior Proposal unless the Company has complied with each of the
requirements of _Section 6.04_ (including _Section 6.04(e)_ ) that the Company
is required to satisfy before taking action pursuant to this _Section
10.01(d)(i)_ and has not otherwise materially and willfully breached any
covenant or agreement set forth in _Section 6.04_ ; or

  



  

(ii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary set forth in
this Agreement shall have occurred that (x) is incapable of being cured prior
to the End Date or (y) otherwise, shall not have been cured (if curable) by
the earlier of 30 calendar days after delivery of notice of such breach in
writing and the End Date and, in each case, that would cause the conditions
set forth in _Section 9.03(a)_ or _Section 9.03(b)_ not to be satisfied.

  



  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
10.01_ (other than pursuant to _Section 10.01(a)_ ) shall give notice of such
termination to the other party.

  



  

Section 10.02 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 10.01_ , this Agreement shall become void and of no
effect without Liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the
other party hereto or to any Financing Source Related Party in their capacity
as such; _provided_ that in the event of termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms (i) no such termination shall relieve the Company

extent such Termination Fee is not paid in full prior to termination, (ii)
neither the Company nor Parent (or Merger Subsidiary) shall be relieved or
released from Liability for (1) willful and material breach of this Agreement,
including any willful and material breach by Parent of _Section 7.06_ which

and in the case of each of (1) and (2), the party agrees that the party that
so breaches or acts with fraud shall be fully liable for any and all
Liabilities and damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be
limited to reimbursement

of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include, to the extent proven,
the benefit of the bargain lost by a party or its stockholders (taking into
consideration relevant matters, including other combination opportunities and
the time value of money), which losses, to the extent proven, shall be deemed
in such event to be damages of such party) incurred or suffered by the other
party as a result of such breach or act of fraud) and (iii) no such
termination shall release the Financing Source Related Parties from any
Liability to Parent and its Subsidiaries, in each case, under or arising out
of the Credit Agreement or any related or replacement agreement (excluding
this Agreement) or any other agreement entered into with Parent or its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Financing Source Related Parties, on
the other hand. The provisions of this _Section 10.02_ and _Section 6.05(h)_
, _11.04_ , _11.07_ , _11.08_ and _11.09 _ and the Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to _Section 10.01_.

Section 11.03 _Amendments and Waivers_.

  



  

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in
the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of

  



  

  



    



    

 83

 



    

any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided
shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by

11.03_ and _Section 10.02_ , _11.06(a)_ (v), _11.08_ (c), _11.09_ ,  _11.13_
(e) may not be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is
adverse in any respect to a Financing Source Related Party without the prior
written consent of the applicable Financing Source.

  



  

Section 11.04 _Expenses_.

  



  

(a) _General_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs,
expenses and Taxes incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such cost, expense or Tax.

  



  

(b) _Termination Fee_.

  



  

(i) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
10.01(c)(i)_ or _Section 10.01(c)(iii)_ or by the Company pursuant to
_Section 10.01(d)(i)_ , then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately
available funds $75,000,000 (the "Termination Fee"). The Termination Fee
shall be payable (A) in the case of a termination by Parent, within three
Business Days after such termination and (B), in the case of a termination by
the Company, immediately before and as a condition to such termination.

  



  

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 10.01(b)(i)_ before the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained or
_Section 10.01(b)(iii)_ , (B) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly
disclosed or announced after the date of this Agreement and not publicly
withdrawn (x) with respect to a termination pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)(i)_
, prior to such termination and (y) with respect to a termination pursuant to
_Section 10.01(b)(iii)_ , __at least five Business Days prior to the Company
Stockholder Meeting and (C) within twelve (12) months following the date
of such termination, the Company or its Subsidiaries shall have entered into
a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated ( _provided_ that for
purposes of this clause (C), each reference to "15%" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%"), then the
Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available funds, concurrently with
the occurrence of the applicable event described in this clause (C), the
Termination Fee.

  



  

(c) Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree that, subject to _Section 10.02_ ,
upon any termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the
Termination Fee is payable by the Company pursuant to this _Section 11.04_
and such

  



  

  



    



    

 84

 



    

Termination Fee is paid in full, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall be
precluded from any other remedy against the Company, at law or in equity or
otherwise, and neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary shall seek to obtain any
recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect,
or punitive damages, against the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries
or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners,
managers, members, shareholders or Affiliates or their respective
Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
11.04_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement and that any amounts payable pursuant to this  _Section
11.04_ do not constitute a penalty; accordingly, if the Company fails to
promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section 11.04_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Subsidiary, as applicable, commences an
Action that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount due
pursuant to this _Section 11.04_ , the Company shall pay to Parent and Merger
Subsidiary its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in
connection with such Action, together with interest on the amount of such
amount or portion thereof at the latest U.S. prime rate as published in The
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made.

  



  

Section 11.05 _Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References_. The parties
hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are
contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other
representations and warranties of such party that are contained in this
Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or
a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties is
reasonably apparent. The mere inclusion of an item in either the Company
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not
be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or
material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable.

  



  

  



    



    

 85

 



    

Section 11.06 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_.

  



  

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns,
and no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person
other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns,
other than: (i) with respect to the provisions of _Section 7.04_ which shall
inure to the benefit of the persons or entities benefiting therefrom who are
intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof, (ii) at and after the
Effective Time, the rights of the holders of shares of Company Stock to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, (iii) at and after the Effective Time, the rights of the
holders of Company Equity Awards to receive the payments contemplated by the
applicable provisions of  _Section 2.04_ , in each case, at the Effective
Time in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (iv)
prior to the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of Common Stock to
pursue claims for damages and other relief, including equitable relief, for
Parent's or Merger Subsidiary's breach of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the rights granted to the holders of Common Stock pursuant
to the foregoing clause (iv) of this _Section 11.06(a)_ shall only be
enforceable on behalf of such holders by the Company in its sole and absolute
discretion and (v) the Financing Source Related Parties (who shall be third
party beneficiaries of, and entitled to enforce, this _Section 11.06(a)_ (v)
and _Section 10.02_ , _11.03(c)_ ,  _11.08(c)_ , _11.09_ and _11.13_ (e)).
The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto.

  



  

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary may assign, in its
sole discretion, any of or all of its rights, interest and obligations
under this Agreement to Parent (in the case of Merger Subsidiary) or to any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (in the case of Parent
or Merger Subsidiary); _provided_ , that no such assignment shall relieve
Parent or Merger Subsidiary of any liability; _provided_ , _further_ , that,
without the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), no such assignment shall
be made to the extent the assignment would be reasonably likely to give rise
to additional withholding Tax obligations with respect to any payments made
under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 11.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules, whether of the state of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction.

claim based upon, arising out of or otherwise relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, or for recognition or enforcement of
any judgment in any Action, proceeding or claim based upon, arising out of or
otherwise relating to this

party or any of its Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates)
exclusively in the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have
subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District
of Delaware (and any of the appropriate respective appellate courts
therefrom), and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and the
appropriate respective appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit,
Action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to (i) the laying of
the venue of any such suit, Action or proceeding in any such court; (ii) any
claim that this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced
in or by any such court; and (iii) any claim that any such suit, Action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Process in any such suit, Action, proceeding or claim may be served on
any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of
any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that
service of process on such party as provided in _Section 11.01_ shall be
deemed effective service of process on such party.

remedies provided for in _Section 11.13(c)_ are not available or otherwise are
not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section 11.13_ shall require
any party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit any party's
right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under _Section
11.13(c)_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under

nor shall the commencement of any legal action or legal proceeding pursuant
to _Section 11.13(c)_ or anything set forth in this _Section 11.13_  restrict
or limit any party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of Article 10.

  



  

(c) The parties hereto agree that (i) irreparable damage, for which monetary
damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would occur if
any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the
terms hereof or was otherwise breached, including if the Merger were not
consummated and the Company's stockholders and holders of Company Stock
Options, Company RSUs and Company Performance Shares did not receive the
aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms but subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and (ii) the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches by any party hereto of this Agreement

hereof, including the parties' obligation to consummate the Merger and
Parent's obligation to pay, and the rights of Company's stockholders and the

parties' obligation to consummate the Merger and Parent's obligation to pay,
and the rights of Company's stockholders and the holders of Company Stock

terms and conditions of this Agreement, and to further waive any requirement
for the securing or posting of any bond or proof of actual damages in
connection with any such remedy.

  



  

(d) If, prior to the End Date, there is a pending Action that has been
brought by a party hereto seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section
