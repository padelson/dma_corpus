PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated
as of June 27, 2001 by and among CMI CORPORATION, an Oklahoma corporation
(the "Company"), TEREX CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
and CLAUDIUS ACQUISITION CORP., an Oklahoma corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub").   W I T N E S S E T H:  
WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved this Agreement, and deem it advisable and in the best
interests of their respective stockholders to consummate the merger of Merger
Sub with and into the Company on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement (the "Merger");   WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax
purposes, it is intended that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code");  
WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent to enter into this
Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company are entering into voting
agreements in the form of the agreements attached as Exhibit A and Exhibit B
(the "Voting Agreements"); and   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition and inducement to the
willingness of Parent to enter into this Agreement, the Company is entering
into a miscellaneous agreement in the form of the agreement attached as
Exhibit C (the "Miscellaneous Agreement"), a non-competition, confidentiality
and non-solicitation agreement in the form of the agreement attached as
Exhibit D (the "Swisher Non-Compete Agreement") and a severance agreement in
the form of the agreement attached as Exhibit E (the "Severance
Agreement").   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements set forth
herein, the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   SECTION
1.1. The Merger. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Oklahoma General Corporation
Act (the "OGCA"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.1(c)). Following the Effective Time,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company
shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall
continue as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent to be governed by the laws of
the State of Oklahoma, and the separate corporate existence of the Company,
with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises,
restrictions, disabilities and duties, shall continue unaffected by the
Merger except as set forth in this Agreement.   (b) The closing of the
Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the
offices of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson, One New York Plaza, New
York, New York 10004 on a date to be specified by the parties (the "Closing
Date"), which shall be no later than the second business day after the first
date that all of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be fulfilled at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of such conditions) have been satisfied
or waived, unless another place, time or date is agreed to by the
parties.   (c) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon
as practicable on or after the Closing Date, the parties shall file with
the Secretary of State of the State of Oklahoma (the "Oklahoma Secretary
of State") a certificate of merger (the "Oklahoma Certificate of Merger")
in accordance with the OGCA and make all other filings or recordings
required under the OGCA as are necessary or advisable to effect the Merger.
The Merger shall become effective at the time of the filing of the
Oklahoma Certificate of Merger with the Oklahoma Secretary of State in
accordance with the OGCA or at such subsequent date or time as Parent and the
Company shall agree and specify in the Oklahoma Certificate of Merger (the
time the Merger becomes effective being hereinafter referred to as the
"Effective Time").   (d) The Merger shall have the effects specified in the
OGCA.   (e) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company, each as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until amended in accordance with applicable law.   (f) At the Effective
Time, the directors and officers of Merger Sub shall be the directors and
officers of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 1.2. Conversion of Shares.
(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof:   (i) each share of voting class A common
stock, par value  $0.10 per share, of the Company (the "Company Class A
Stock") and each  share of the voting common stock, par value $0.10 per
share, of the  Company (the "Company Voting Stock" and, together with the
Company  Class A Stock, the "Company Common Stock") held by the Company as 
treasury stock or owned by Parent, or any Subsidiary (as defined  below) of
Parent or any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to  the Effective
Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made  with respect
thereto;   (ii) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,  of
Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time  shall be
converted into and become one share of common stock of the  Surviving
Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as  the shares so
converted and shall constitute the only outstanding  shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation; and   (iii) each share of Company Common Stock
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, except as
otherwise  provided in Section 1.2(a)(i), be converted into the right to
receive  0.16 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent
(the  "Parent Common Stock"), subject to adjustment as provided in Section 
1.2(b) (the "Exchange Ratio").   (b) (i) In the event that the consolidated
net debt of the Company, calculated as specified in Appendix I, as of the end
of the last business day of the last full week immediately preceding the
Closing Date (the "Closing Debt"), is greater than $75,250,000 (the "Target
Debt"), the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to a number (rounded down to the
nearest ten-thousandth) equal to the product of .16 multiplied by a fraction,
(A) the numerator of which is the sum of (x) the product of $3.5536 and
the Closing Outstanding Share Number (as defined below) and (y) the
Target Debt, and (B) the denominator of which is the sum of (x) the product
of $3.5536 and the Closing Outstanding Share Number and (y) the Closing
Debt.   (ii) In the event that the Closing Debt is greater than 
$90,000,000 (the "High Target Debt"), the Exchange Ratio shall be  adjusted
to a number (rounded down to the nearest ten-thousandth)  equal to the
product of .1458 multiplied by a fraction, (A) the  numerator of which is (x)
the product of $3.2382 and the Closing  Outstanding Share Number minus (y)
the Closing Debt minus the High  Target Debt, and (B) the denominator of
which is the product of  $3.2382 and the Closing Outstanding Share
Number.   (c) One business day prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent (x) a certificate, executed by the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company, certifying to Parent the Closing Debt, the
amount of each of the items comprising the Closing Debt set forth on Appendix
I, and such other information regarding the calculation of the Closing Debt
as Parent shall reasonably request and (y) a certificate executed by
the Company\'s stock transfer agent certifying the number of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on the
immediately preceding business day (the "Closing Outstanding Share
Number").   (d) All Parent Common Stock issued as provided in
Section 1.2(a)(iii) shall be of the same class and shall have the same terms
as the currently outstanding Parent Common Stock. The shares of Parent
Common Stock to be received as consideration pursuant to the Merger with
respect to shares of Company Common Stock (together with cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 1.6) is
referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration."   (e) From and after the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock converted in accordance
with Section 1.2(a)(iii) shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any such shares (a "Certificate") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration and any dividends payable pursuant to Section
1.3(f). From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the
common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they
were converted in accordance with Section 1.2(a)(ii).   SECTION 1.3.
Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint
American Stock Transfer and Trust Co. or such other exchange agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of
exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders
of the Certificates for exchange in accordance with this Article I,
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
this Article I upon surrender of the Certificates. Parent shall make
available to the Exchange Agent from time to time as required after the
Effective Time cash necessary to pay dividends and other distributions in
accordance with this Article I and to make payments in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.6. Promptly after
the Effective Time, Parent will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to
send, to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock as of the
Effective Time, a letter of transmittal for use in such exchange (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) in
such form as the Company and Parent may reasonably agree, for use in
effecting delivery of shares of Company Common Stock to the Exchange
Agent.   (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have
been converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, will be entitled to promptly receive the
Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate
shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right
to receive such Merger Consideration.   (c) If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be issued to or registered in the name of a Person (as
defined below) other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such issuance or
registration that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other taxes required as a result of such issuance or registration
in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not payable. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Person" means an individual, a corporation, a limited liability
company, a partnership, an association, a trust or any other entity or
organization, including a government or political subdivision or any agency
or instrumentality thereof.   (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be
no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, they shall be canceled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with
the procedures set forth, in this Article I.   (e) Any portion of the
Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section
1.3(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon
demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such holder\'s shares of
Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Section 1.3 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for
delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holder\'s shares.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of
shares for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   (f) No
dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates until
such Certificates are surrendered as provided in this Section 1.3. Subject to
the effect of applicable laws, following such surrender, there shall be paid,
without interest, to the record holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all dividends
and other distributions payable in respect of such Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the
date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
such Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with
a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or
other distributions in respect of Parent Common Stock, all shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to
dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time.   (g) The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Merger Consideration, as directed by Parent, on a
daily basis; provided, however, that no such investment or loss thereon shall
affect the amounts payable or the timing of the amounts payable to the
Company\'s stockholders pursuant to the provisions of this Article I. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent upon the six-month anniversary of the Effective Time.   SECTION 1.4.
Stock Options and Equity Awards.  -------------------------------   (a) At
the Effective Time, each outstanding employee or director option to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock (a "Company Stock Option") granted under the
Company\'s plans or agreements pursuant to which Company Stock Options or
other stock-based awards of the Company have been or may be granted
(collectively, the "Company Stock Plans"), whether vested or not vested,
shall be deemed assumed by Parent. At and after the Effective Time (1) each
Company Stock Option then outstanding shall become an option (a "Parent Stock
Option") to acquire the number (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of
shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio (as
adjusted pursuant to Section 1.2(b)), and (2) the exercise price per share of
Parent Common Stock subject to any such Company Stock Option at and after the
Effective Time shall be an amount (rounded down to the nearest one-hundredth
of a cent) equal to (x) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to the applicable Company Stock Option prior to the Effective Time,
divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio (as adjusted pursuant to Section 1.2(b)).
Other than as provided above, as of and after the Effective Time, each Parent
Stock Option shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable
Company Stock Option as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
but giving effect to the Merger.   (b) Parent shall take all corporate
action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of
Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Parent Stock Options.  
(c) On or as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration
statement on an appropriate form or a post-effective amendment to a
previously filed registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "Securities Act"),
with respect to the Parent Common Stock subject to Parent Stock Options and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the current status of
the prospectus contained therein, as well as comply with any applicable state
securities or "blue sky" laws, for so long as such options remain
outstanding.   SECTION 1.5. Adjustments. If at any time during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in
the outstanding shares of capital stock of Parent or the Company shall occur
by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any
similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during
such period, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.   SECTION
1.6. Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued in the Merger, but in lieu thereof, each holder of shares of Company
Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock
will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 1.6, an amount of cash, without interest thereon
(rounded to the nearest whole cent), equal to the product of (i) such
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the average of
the closing price of one share of Parent Common Stock on The New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") composite transaction reporting system as
reported in The Wall Street Journal (but subject to correction for
typographical or other manifest errors in such reporting) over the ten
trading-day period immediately preceding the Closing Date. The fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock will be aggregated and no stockholder of the
Company will be entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to or greater
than the value of one full share of Parent Common Stock.   SECTION 1.7.
Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this Article I such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.   SECTION 1.8. Lost
Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming the
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by that Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct (which shall not
exceed amounts generally required by Parent from holders of Parent Common
Stock under similar circumstances), as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares represented by such
Certificates as contemplated by this Article I.   SECTION 1.9. Shares Held
by Company Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, no shares of Parent Common Stock (or certificates therefor)
shall be issued in exchange for any Certificate to any Person who may be an
"affiliate" of the Company (identified pursuant to Section 6.3) until the
Person shall have delivered to Parent and the Company a duly executed letter
as contemplated by Section 6.3.   SECTION 1.10. Appraisal Rights. In
accordance with Section 1091(B) of the OGCA, no appraisal rights shall be
available to holders of shares of Company Class A Stock in connection with
the Merger. Holders of Company Voting Stock which are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a holder who
has not voted those shares in favor of the approval and adoption of this
Agreement, who shall have delivered a written demand for appraisal of those
shares in accordance with the OGCA and who, as of the Effective Time, shall
not have effectively withdrawn or lost this right to appraisal (the
"Dissenting Shares") shall be entitled to those rights (but only those
rights) as are granted by Section 1091 of the OGCA. Each holder of Dissenting
Shares who becomes entitled to payment for those Dissenting Shares pursuant
to Section 1091 of the OGCA shall receive payment from the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with the OGCA; provided, however, that (i) if any
holder of Dissenting Shares shall have failed to establish their entitlement
to appraisal rights as provided in Section 1091 of the OGCA, (ii) if any

WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as set forth in the corresponding
sections of the Company\'s disclosure schedule, which has been delivered by
the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure Schedule"), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent
as follows:   SECTION 2.1. Organization and Good Standing; Organizational
Documents. (a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Oklahoma. Each of
the Company\'s Subsidiaries (the "Company Subsidiaries") is a corporation
or other business entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is qualified
or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation or other business entity,
as applicable, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where
the character of its properties owned, operated or leased or the nature of
its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure
to be so qualified or licensed will not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement,
the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any change, effect,
circumstance or event that is or is reasonably likely to (i) be materially
adverse to the business, results of operations, assets or liabilities,
financial condition or prospects of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
taken as a whole or (ii) materially adversely affect the ability of the
Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement or timely consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than any such change,
effect, circumstance or event resulting from any changes in general
economic, regulatory or political conditions. The Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have all requisite corporate or similar organizational
power and all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and
approvals required to carry on their respective businesses as they are now
being conducted and necessary to own, operate and lease their properties
and assets, except those licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals,
the failure of which to possess will not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement,
a "Subsidiary" means, with respect to any corporation or other entity,
any other corporation or other entity in which the first entity owns,
directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent of the securities or other
ownership interest having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect at
least a majority of the board of directors or other Persons performing
similar functions.   (b) The Company has furnished or otherwise made
available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the Company\'s Certificate
of Incorporation and all amendments thereto, as currently in effect
(the "Certificate of Incorporation") and Bylaws and all amendments thereto,
as currently in effect (the "Bylaws"). The Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws and all similar organizational documents of the Company
Subsidiaries are in full force and effect. The Company is not in violation of
the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws and, except as will
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, none of the Company Subsidiaries is in violation of any
similar organizational documents of such Company Subsidiary.   SECTION 2.2.

Company consists of 20,000 shares of Company Voting Stock, 45,000,000 shares

options or other agreements of any kind relating to, or the value of which is
tied to the value of, any of the outstanding, authorized but not issued,
unauthorized or treasury shares of the capital stock or any other security of
the Company, and there is no authorized or outstanding security of any kind
convertible into or exchangeable for any such capital stock or other
security. There are no restrictions imposed by the Company upon the transfer
of or otherwise pertaining to the securities (including, but not limited to,
the ability to pay dividends thereon) or retained earnings of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries or the ownership thereof other than those imposed by
the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and
the rules and regulations thereunder (the "Exchange Act"), applicable
state securities Laws, applicable corporate Law or the Certificate
of Incorporation.   SECTION 2.3. Subsidiaries. The Company does not own,

the outstanding shares of capital stock in each of the Company Subsidiaries
are duly authorized, validly issued and outstanding, fully paid
and nonassessable, and were issued free of preemptive rights in compliance
with applicable corporate and securities laws. There are no irrevocable
proxies or similar obligations with respect to such capital stock of the
Company Subsidiaries held by the Company and no equity securities or
other interests of any of the Company Subsidiaries are or may become required
to be issued or purchased by reason of any options, warrants, rights
to subscribe to, puts, calls or commitments of any character
whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible into or
exchangeable for, shares of any capital stock of any Company Subsidiary, and
there are no contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which
any Company Subsidiary is bound to issue additional shares of its capital
stock, or options, warrants or rights to purchase or acquire any additional
shares of its capital stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable
for such shares. The term "Lien" means, with respect to any asset, any
mortgage, lien, pledge, charge, security interest or encumbrance of any kind
in respect of such asset, other than liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable in the ordinary course of business.   SECTION 2.4. Authorization;

Incorporation or Bylaws or the organizational documents of any of the Company
Subsidiaries or otherwise in order for the Company to consummate the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby.   (c) As of the date hereof, the

other Governmental Authority ("Law") currently in effect to which the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or its or any of their respective assets
are subject, except in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, for
any deviations from the foregoing which will not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 2.7.
Company Securities Filings. As of their respective dates, or as of the date
of the last amendment thereof, if amended after filing, none of the Company
Securities Filings (as defined below) (including all schedules and exhibits

Filings (or incorporated therein by reference), neither the Company nor any
of the Company Subsidiaries has or is subject to any liabilities (absolute,

contracts, agreements or other instruments related  to any Significant
Transaction (as defined below) pursuant to which  the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has any obligations (whether  absolute, accrued, asserted,
unasserted or contingent or otherwise,  and whether pursuant to any earn-out
or post-closing adjustment) to  issue any shares of capital stock or other
securities of the Company  or any securities of any Company Subsidiary or
deliver any other  consideration as part of any such Significant Transaction.
For  purposes of this Agreement, "Significant Transaction" shall mean any

material assets or properties other than in the ordinary course of  business;

(i) Each contract or agreement disclosed or required to be disclosed in
Schedule 2.14 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and each Material Contract
(collectively, the "Significant Contracts") is in full force and effect and
constitutes a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Company
and each Company Subsidiary to the extent any such entity is a party thereto
and, to the knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto, except as the

to or affecting creditors\' rights generally or by general equitable
principles.   (ii) No Consent of any person is needed in order that each 
such Significant Contract shall continue in full force and effect in

time or the giving of notice would  cause such violation or default under)
any such Significant Contract;  nor to the Company\'s knowledge is any other
party to any such  Significant Contract in violation or breach of or default
under (nor  does there exist any condition which upon the passage of time or
the  giving of notice would cause such violation or default under) any such 
Significant Contract, in each case where such violation or breach,

SECTION 2.15. Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Schedule 2.15 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete list of all material
"employee benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")), bonus,
pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation,
excess benefit, stock, stock option, severance, termination pay, change in
control or other material employee benefit plans, programs, arrangements or
agreements currently maintained, or contributed to, or required to be
maintained or contributed to, by the Company or any Company Subsidiary for
the benefit of any current or former employees, officers, directors or
independent contractors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or with
respect to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any
liability (collectively, the "Benefit Plans"). The Company has delivered or
made available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of each Benefit
Plan.   (b) Each Benefit Plan has been administered in accordance with its
terms and in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA (including,
without limitation, the making of all contributions and payments), the Code,
and other applicable law, except where the failure to so administer or comply
will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. All Benefit Plans intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code are so qualified and have been the subject of favorable
determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), and, to
the knowledge of the Company, no circumstances exist that could result in the
loss of such qualified status.   (c) Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary, nor any current or former Company ERISA Affiliate, has incurred
any material liability under Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code
that will have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Company ERISA Affiliate" is a
person or entity that is considered one employer with the Company under
Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code. No Benefit Plan is
subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and no Benefit Plan
is a "multi-employer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA).   (d)
With respect to any Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan (as
defined in Section 3(l) of ERISA), (i) no such Benefit Plan provides
benefits, including without limitation, death or medical benefits, beyond
termination of employment or retirement other than (A) coverage mandated by
statute or (B) death or retirement benefits under a Benefit Plan qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code, and (ii) each such Benefit Plan (including
any such Plan covering retirees or other former employees) may be amended or
terminated without liability, except as will not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (e) There is no
pending or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened litigation relating to
employment, termination of employment, compensation or employee benefits
involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary which, if determined
adversely to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, will, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (f) In the event
that any individual is classified by the Company or any Company Subsidiary as
a non-employee (such as an independent contractor, leased employee,
consultant or special consultant) and is later reclassified as an employee
upon governmental or judicial review, notwithstanding such reclassification,
no such individual shall be eligible to participate in any Benefit Plan,
except where such eligibility will not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (g) The execution of, and
performance of the transactions contemplated in, this Agreement will not
(either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events)
(i) constitute an event under any Benefit Plan that will or may result in any
payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of
indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to
fund benefits with respect to any employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or (ii) result in the triggering or imposition of any
restrictions or limitations on the right of the Company or Parent to cause
any such Benefit Plan to be amended or terminated (or which would result in
any materially adverse consequence for so doing). No payment or benefit that
will or may be made by the Company, Parent, or any of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates with respect to any employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary under any Benefit Plan in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be characterized as an
"excess parachute payment," within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code or will not be deductible by reason of Section 162(m) of the Code.  
(h) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any
collective bargaining agreement covering any current or former employees of
either of them. There are no union organizational efforts pending or, to the
Company\'s knowledge, threatened involving any employees of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary.   SECTION 2.16. Taxes and Returns. (a) (i) All Tax
Returns (as defined below) required to be filed by or on behalf of the
Company, each of the Company Subsidiaries, and each affiliated, combined,
consolidated or unitary group of which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is or has been a member (a "Company Group") have been timely
filed in the manner prescribed by law, and all such Tax Returns are true,
complete and accurate except to the extent any failures to file or failures
to be true, correct or accurate will not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii) all Taxes (as defined below) due
and owing by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Group
(whether or not shown on a Tax Return) have been timely paid, or adequately
reserved for in accordance with GAAP, except to the extent any failure to pay
or reserve will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect; (iii) there are no claims or assessments presently
pending against the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Group, for
any alleged Tax deficiency, and the Company has no knowledge of any
threatened claims or assessments against the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or any Company Group for any alleged Tax deficiency, which in either case if
upheld will, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect; (iv) to the knowledge of the Company, no issues have been
raised in any audit or tax examination of the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any Company Group which, if determined adversely, will,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (v)
there are no Liens for Taxes on any asset of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, except for Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable and Liens for
Taxes that will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect; and (vi) the Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries has complied in all respects with all rules and regulations
relating to the withholding of Taxes (including, without limitation,
employee-related Taxes), except for failures to comply that will not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.  
(b) (i) to the Company\'s knowledge, no taxing authority in any jurisdiction
where the Company or any Company Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns has
made a claim, assertion or threat that the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is or may be subject to Tax in such jurisdiction and (ii) neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has agreed to any adjustment under Section 481(a)
of the Code (or analogous provisions of state, local or foreign law), as a
result of a change of accounting method or otherwise, or has disposed of any
assets under the installment method pursuant to Section 453 of the Code, in
each case under this clause (ii) which would require the inclusion of a
material amount in income after the Effective Date.   (c) The statutes of
limitations for the federal income Tax Returns of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, any Company Group) have expired
or otherwise have been closed for all taxable periods ending on or before
December 31, 1996.   For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Tax" or "Taxes"
means all taxes, levies or other like assessments, charges or fees (including
estimated taxes, charges and fees), including, without limitation,
income, corporation, advance corporation, gross receipts, transfer,
excise, property, sales, use, value-added, license, payroll, withholding,
social security and franchise or other governmental taxes or charges, imposed
by the United States or any state, county, local or foreign government
or subdivision or agency thereof, any liability for taxes, levies or
other like assessments, charges or fees of another person pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar or analogous provision
of applicable law or otherwise (including, without limitation, as a

or outstanding security of any kind convertible into or exchangeable for
any such capital stock or other security. There are no restrictions imposed
by Parent upon the transfer of or otherwise pertaining to the

Sub or the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,

stockholders of the Company that they approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any necessary approval by the Company\'s stockholders (the
"Company Stockholder Approval") of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided that the Board of Directors of the Company may
withdraw, modify or change such recommendation of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby if it has determined in good faith, based on
such matters as it deems relevant and after receiving advice from the
Company\'s outside legal counsel, that the failure to withdraw, modify or
change its recommendation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary
duties of the Board of Directors of the Company under applicable Law. Whether
or not the Board of Directors of the Company has withdrawn, modified or
changed its recommendation of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or receives a Takeover Proposal (as defined below),
the Company shall take all steps necessary to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company
Stockholders Meeting") as soon as practicable after the date hereof for the
purpose of approving this Agreement and the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby and for such other purposes as may be consented to by
Parent and the Company in connection with effectuating the transactions
contemplated hereby.   SECTION 4.5. Commercially Reasonable Efforts.
Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, the Company agrees to

obtain all third party Consents required in connection with the execution and
delivery by the Company of this Agreement or the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) to the extent requested by

warrants or options previously granted pursuant to any such Benefit Plan

Company nor any Company Subsidiary, nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, affiliates, accountants, counsel, investment
bankers, financial advisors or other representatives (collectively,
"Representatives") shall (i) directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or
encourage, or take any action to facilitate the making of, any Takeover
Proposal, or (ii) directly or indirectly engage in any discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information or data to, or afford any

Takeover Proposal, or (iii) approve any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement relating to any
Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that at any time prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting, the Company may, in response to a Takeover Proposal
that is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined below)
and which was not solicited in violation of this Section 4.8(a), and subject
to providing Parent reasonable advance written notice of its decision to take
such action (x) furnish information with respect to the Company, or the
Company Subsidiaries to any person making such Takeover Proposal pursuant to
a customary confidentiality agreement on terms no less restrictive than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (y) participate
in discussions and negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal but, in
each case, only if the Company\'s Board of Directors determines, after
receiving the advice of its outside counsel, that failure to furnish such
information or to participate in such discussions or negotiations would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board
of Directors of the Company under applicable Law. The Company shall
keep Parent apprised of any such discussions and negotiations promptly
after they occur.   (b) The Company shall promptly and as soon as possible
(but in no event later than one day after receipt thereof) advise the Parent
orally and in writing of any Takeover Proposal, the identity of the person
making any such Takeover Proposal and the material terms of any such
Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep the Parent fully informed of the
status and material terms of any such Takeover Proposal. In the event the
Company receives a Takeover Proposal, paragraph 9 of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall immediately be terminated and shall have no further force and
effect.   (c) The Company and each Company Subsidiary and each of
their Representatives shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all existing discussions and negotiations, if any, with any other
persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal.   (d)
The Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for the
purpose of approving this Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement regardless of the recommendation
or any change in the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company
with respect thereto.   For purposes of this Agreement, a "Takeover
Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person (other than
Parent) relating to (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a
business that constitutes 35% or more of the net revenues, net income or
assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 35%
or more of the common stock or voting power (or of securities or rights
convertible into or exercisable for such common stock or voting power) of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 35% or
more of the common stock or voting power (or of securities or rights
convertible into or exercisable for such common stock or voting power) of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries, or (iii) any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries
that constitutes 35% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of
the Company, and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in each case other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the
transactions referred to in clauses (i) - (iii) of the foregoing definition
of Takeover Proposal, other than the Merger proposed by this Agreement, is
referred to herein as an "Acquisition Transaction."   For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written proposal made by
a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a
tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, for
consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than 35% of the
combined voting power of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding
or more than 35% of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
together, that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good
faith judgment (based on (x) the advice of a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation (the "Financial Advisor") and (y) such other matters as
the Board of Directors of the Company deems relevant, which may include
without limitation the likelihood of consummation, the ability of such third
party to finance such transaction and, if securities form a part of
the consideration, the trading market and liquidity of such securities
offered in connection with the Superior Proposal) that the terms of which are
more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders from a financial point of view
than those terms contained herein. If such proposal (1) is subject to
a financing condition or (2) involves consideration that is not entirely
cash or does not permit the Company\'s stockholders to receive the payment of
the offered consideration in respect of all shares at the same time,
such proposal shall not be deemed a Superior Proposal unless the Board
of Directors of the Company has been furnished with a written opinion of
the Financial Advisor to the effect that (in the case of clause (1))
such proposal is readily financeable and (in the case of clause (2)) that
such proposal provides a higher value per share than the Merger
Consideration.   (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the
Board of Directors of the Company from taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act or from making any other disclosure to its stockholders if, in
the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after
consultation with counsel, failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with
its obligations under applicable Law.   SECTION 4.9. Commission and
Stockholder Filings; Other Reports. The Company shall send to Parent a copy
of all public reports and materials as and when it sends the same to its
stockholders, the Commission, the NYSE or any securities exchange or any
state or foreign securities commission. The Company shall send to Parent a
copy of all communications with banks, trustees under any indentures or other
debt instruments and rating agencies as and when it sends such communications
to such parties.   SECTION 4.10. Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute
is or may become applicable to the Merger or the transactions contemplated
hereby, the Company and the members of its Board of Directors will grant
such approvals and will take such other actions as are necessary so that
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby
and will otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any
Takeover Statute on the Merger and any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.   ARTICLE V  COVENANTS OF PARENT   Parent covenants and agrees as
follows:   SECTION 5.1. Notification of Certain Matters. Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company if any of the following occurs after the date of
this Agreement: (i) receipt of any notice or other communication in writing

other than a Consent disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 or 3.5 above or

any material notice or other communication from any Governmental
Authority (including, but not limited to, the NYSE or any other securities

Parent or Merger Sub, in his or her capacity as such or as a fiduciary under
a Benefit Plan of Parent, which relates to the consummation of the
Merger; and (v) the occurrence of any Event that is reasonably likely to
cause a breach by Parent of any provision of this Agreement. If Parent

Governmental Authority that could affect the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, or
should Parent become aware of any fact including any change in law or
regulations (or any interpretation thereof) that is reasonably likely to
cause such Governmental Authority to withhold its consent to or approval of
the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereunder, Parent shall promptly
notify the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
take such steps as may be necessary to remove any such impediment of Parent
or the Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by

contemplated hereby, and (iv) promptly make all necessary filings under the
HSR Act and any other applicable Law, including any filing required to be
made with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act.   (b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall require, or
be construed to require, Parent, in connection with the receipt of
any regulatory approval, to proffer to, or agree to (a) sell, hold
separate, discontinue or limit, before or after the Effective Time, any
assets, businesses, or interest in any assets or businesses of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (or to consent to any sale,
or agreement to sell, or discontinuance or limitation by the Company of any
of its assets or businesses) or (b) agree to any conditions relating to,
or changes or restriction in, the operations of any such assets or
businesses which, in either case would, in the reasonable judgment of
Parent, materially adversely impact the economic or business benefits to
Parent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a "Merger
Benefit Detriment").   SECTION 5.3. Compliance. In consummating the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent shall comply, and cause the
Merger Sub to comply or to be in compliance, in all material respects, with
all applicable Laws.   SECTION 5.4. Director and Officer Liability. (a)
Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and all limitations on
liability existing in favor of any individual, who on or at any time prior to
the Effective Time was an officer or director of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (an "Indemnified Person") in respect of acts or omissions of such
Indemnified Person on or prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or the organizational documents of the
Company Subsidiaries or an agreement between an Indemnified Person and the
Company or any Company Subsidiary in effect as of the date of this Agreement,
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms, and
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
the individuals who on or at any time prior to the Effective Time
were directors or officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all
such indemnification provisions.   (b) In the event that the Surviving
Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.4.   (c) For six years after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain in effect and honor the Company\'s current directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time covering each person currently covered by the Company\'s
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy on terms with respect
to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of each such policy
in effect on the date hereof; provided that Parent shall not be required to
procure any such coverage for an amount in excess of the amount of the
Company\'s current annual premium for its existing coverage and; provided,
further, that Parent may substitute therefor policies no less favorable in
any material respect to such insured persons.   (d) The provisions of this
Section 5.4 are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or her representatives
and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or
otherwise.   SECTION 5.5. Access and Information. Between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, Parent shall give and shall direct
its financial advisors, accountants and legal counsel to give, upon
reasonable notice, the Company, its lenders, financial advisors, accountants
and legal counsel and their respective authorized representatives at all
reasonable times access to all offices and other facilities and to all
contracts, agreements, commitments, Tax Returns (and supporting schedules),
books and records of or pertaining to Parent and to permit the foregoing to
make such reasonable inspections as they may require and will cause its
officers promptly to furnish the Company with (a) such financial and
operating data and other information with respect to the business and
properties of Parent as the Company may from time to time reasonably request
and (b) a copy of each material report, schedule and other document filed or
received by Parent pursuant to the requirements of applicable securities laws
or the NYSE. In the event that the foregoing access is subject to
restrictions contained in confidentiality agreements to which Parent is a
party, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain waivers of
such restrictions. All information obtained by the Company pursuant to
this Section 5.5 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the terms of
that certain letter agreement, dated as of May 25, 2001, by and between
Parent and the Company (the "Company Confidentiality Agreement").   SECTION
5.6. Blue Sky Permits. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, prior to the effective date of the Form S-4 (as defined below), all
materially necessary state securities laws or "blue sky" permits and
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Merger, and will pay all expenses incident thereto.  
SECTION 5.7. Listing. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
and, following the Effective Time, upon exercise of Parent Stock Options to
be listed on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to
the Closing Date.   SECTION 5.8. Employee Benefits. (a) Following the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to
individuals who are employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
immediately before the Effective Time and who continue to be employed by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time (the "Company Employees") employee benefits that are, in the
aggregate, not less favorable than those provided to those individuals who
immediately following the Effective Time are similarly situated employees of
Parent (other than Company Employees). The foregoing shall not be construed
to prevent the termination of employment of any Company Employee or
the amendment or termination of any particular Benefit Plan of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary to the extent permitted by its terms as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time.   (b) For purposes of
eligibility and vesting under the benefit plans of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective
Time (the "New Plans"), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
predecessor employers before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Benefit Plans, except to the extent such credit
would result in a duplicate creation of benefits. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under
a Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before
the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii)
for the purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall
cause all pre-existing exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents,
and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and
his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the
Old Plan ending on the date such employee\'s participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.   ARTICLE VI  COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES  
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company covenants and agree as follows:   SECTION
6.1. Registration Statement; Proxy Statement. (a) Each of Parent and the
Company shall cooperate and promptly prepare and Parent shall file with the
Commission as soon as practicable a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (or
any successor form) (the "Form S-4") under the Securities Act with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable and deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement. A portion of the Form S-4 shall serve as a prospectus with respect
to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable and deliverable pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement and as the Company\'s proxy statement with respect to
the Company Stockholders Meeting (the "Company Proxy Statement"). Each of
Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the
Form S-4 declared effective by the Commission as promptly as practicable
after the filing. Parent will advise the Company, promptly after it receives
notice, of (i) the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any
supplement or amendment thereto has been filed, (ii) the issuance of any stop
order or (iii) the suspension of the qualification of the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable and deliverable in connection with the Merger for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction.   (b) The Company and Parent each
agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by it or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or the Company Proxy Statement,
including any amendment or supplement, will, at the time the Form S-4 becomes
effective under the Securities Act, or, in the case of the Company Proxy
Statement, at the date of mailing to stockholders and at the time of the
Company Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the date
of the consummation of the Merger any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should
be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment and/or a supplement to the Form S-4 or the Company Proxy Statement,
so that the Form S-4 or the Company Proxy Statement would not, at the time
the Form S-4 becomes effective under the Securities Act, or, in the case of
the Company Proxy Statement, at the date of mailing to stockholders and at
the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers this information shall promptly notify the other party and, to the
extent required by Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
that information shall be promptly filed with the Commission or any
other applicable Governmental Authority and, to the extent required by
Law, disseminated to the Company\'s stockholders.   SECTION 6.2. Further
Assurances. In addition to complying with all of the other covenants set
forth in this Agreement, each party hereto shall, subject to the fulfillment
at or before the Effective Time of each of the conditions of performance set
forth herein or the waiver thereof, perform such further acts and execute
such documents as may be reasonably required to effect the Transactions.  
SECTION 6.3. Affiliate Letters. Not less than 15 days prior to the Effective
Time, the Company (i) shall have delivered to Parent a letter identifying all
Persons who, in the opinion of the Company, may be, as of the date of the
Company Stockholder Meeting, its "affiliates" for purposes of Rule 145 under
the Securities Act, and (ii) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause each Person who is identified as an "affiliate" of it in such letter to
deliver, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than 10 days prior
to the Closing (or after such later date as the Parent and the Company may
agree), a signed agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit F.
Each of Parent and the Company shall notify the other party from time to time
after the delivery of the letter described in this Section 6.3 of any Person
not identified on such letter who then is, or may be, such an "affiliate" and
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each additional Person who is
identified as an "affiliate" to execute a signed agreement as set forth in
this Section 6.3.   SECTION 6.4. Tax Treatment. (a) The parties hereto
intend that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)
of the Code and that this Agreement will constitute a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation ss. 1.368-2(g).
From and after the date hereof until the Effective Time, each party hereto
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and
neither party hereto will knowingly take any action, cause any action to be
taken, fail to take any action, or cause any action to fail to be taken which
action or failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.   (b) As of the date
hereof, the Company does not know of any reason why it would not be able to
deliver to Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson at the date of the legal
opinion referred to in Section 7.1.5, a certificate substantially in
compliance with IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with customary
exceptions and modifications thereto, to enable such firm to deliver the
legal opinion contemplated by Section 7.1.5, and the Company agrees to
deliver such certificate effective as of the date of such opinion.   (c) As
of the date hereof, Parent does not know of any reason why it would not be
able to deliver to Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson at the date of
the legal opinion referred to in Section 7.1.5, a certificate substantially
in compliance with IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with customary
exceptions and modifications thereto, to enable such firm to deliver the
legal opinion contemplated by Section 7.1.5, and Parent agrees to deliver
such certificate effective as of the date of such opinion.   SECTION 6.5.
Letters from Accountants. (a) Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent and the Company two "comfort"
letters from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, one dated no earlier than three
business days prior to the date on which the Form S-4 shall become effective
and one dated no earlier than three business days prior to the Closing Date,
each addressed to the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company, in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and customary in scope for comfort
letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements similar to the Form S-4.   (b) The Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to the Company
and Parent two "comfort" letters from KPMG LLP, one dated no earlier than
three business days prior to the date on which the Form S-4 shall become
effective and one dated no earlier than three business days prior to the
Closing Date, each addressed to the Boards of Directors of the Company and
Parent, in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and customary in scope for
comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection
with registration statements similar to the Form S-4.   SECTION 6.6.
Section 16(b). Parent and the Company shall take all actions required
pursuant to Rules 16b-3(d) and 16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act to cause the
disposition in the Merger of the Company Common Stock and Company Stock
Options and the acquisition in the Merger of Parent Common Stock and Parent
Stock Options to be exempt from the provisions of Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act.   SECTION 6.7. Press Release and Public Announcements. The
parties shall cooperate in preparing and promptly issuing a press release
announcing the execution of this Agreement. Thereafter, so long as this
Agreement is in effect, (i) the Company shall not, and shall cause its
affiliates not to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or any
other announcement with respect to the Merger, the Company Stockholders
Meeting or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
consent of Parent, except when such release or announcement is required by
applicable Law or the rules or regulations of the NYSE, in which case the
Company, prior to making such announcement, shall consult with Parent
regarding the same and (ii) prior to the issuance or publication of any press
release or any other announcement Parent shall provide the Company with
reasonable advance notice of such press release or announcement.   ARTICLE
