all of its right, title and interest in and to 107,920 Class B Common Units in

as general partner of PPRLP, hereby consents to the transfer of 1700480s
equity interest in PPRLP and its withdrawal as a limited partner of PPRLP
pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that for the avoidance of doubt
1700480 expressly reserves all rights, if any, that it may have to
indemnification under the organizational documents of PPRLP as a result of its
status as a limited partner until the Closing.

 



 

 **2.2 Purchase and Sale of Queens JV Interests**. 1700480 shall assign all of
its right, title and interest in and to 490 Class B Common Units in Queens JV
to Macerich Queens, free and clear of any liens or encumbrances created or
granted by or on behalf of 1700480, and (ii) Macerich Queens shall accept such

pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that for the avoidance of doubt
1700480 expressly reserves all rights, if any, that it may have to
indemnification under the organizational documents of Queens JV as a result of
its status as a limited partner until the Closing. The 107,920 Class B Common
Units in PPRLP and 30 Electing Common Units in PPRT held by 1700480 and being
sold pursuant to Section 2.1 and the 490 Class B Common Units in Queens JV
held by 1700480 and being sold pursuant to Section 2.2 are referred to
collectively herein as the " **JV Interests** ".

 



 

 **2.3 Consideration; Allocation of Consideration**. As consideration for the
assignments set forth in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, Macerich shall deliver to
1700480 (i) $1.00 in cash (the " **Cash Consideration** ") and (ii) 17,140,845
shares of Macerich Common Stock (the " **Purchased Macerich Shares** "). A
physical stock certificate, in standard form approved by the Macerich board of
directors, identifying 1700480 as the registered holder thereof and
representing the Purchased Macerich Shares will be made available to 1700480
at the offices of Computershare, Macerichs transfer agent, in Edison, N.J.
and Macerich shall instruct Computershare to deliver such certificate to a
representative of 1700480 pursuant to such instructions as 1700480 will have
delivered at least 24 hours in advance, which representative shall collect the
stock certificate in person from Computershares office in Edison, N.J. For
purposes of reporting this transaction to governmental authorities, the
parties will act in good faith to agree on the value of the total
consideration attributable to equity interests in PPRLP and

 



      
 

 



 

PPRT and to equity interests in Queens JV as promptly as practicable after
review of estimated apportionments and agreement on working capital
adjustments, if any.

 



 

 **2.4 Voting Agreement**. If 1700480 and its affiliates (as defined in the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " **Securities Act** ")), collectively
own (beneficially or of record) greater than 9.9% of the outstanding shares of
Macerich Common Stock, 1700480 shall cause to be voted in accordance with the
recommendations of the Macerich board of directors such number of shares of
Macerich Common Stock owned by 1700480 and such affiliates, taken together,
equal to the difference of (a) the aggregate number of shares of Macerich
Common Stock owned by 1700480 and its Affiliates minus (b) such number of
shares that represents 9.9% of the outstanding shares of Macerich Common
Stock. The obligations pursuant to this Section 2.4 will survive the Closing
(as defined below), but automatically will expire and be of no further force
or effect on the first date on which OTPP and its affiliates, including
1700480, no longer own a number of shares of Macerich Common Stock that
exceeds the Ownership Limit (as defined in Macerichs charter).

 



 

 **2.5 Tax Treatment**. The Parties will treat and report the transaction
contemplated by Section 2 of this Agreement as a purchase and sale of 107,920
Class B Common Units in PPRLP and 30 Electing Common Units in PPRT and 490

Unitholders Agreement Rights and Obligations.

 



 

 **3.** ** ****_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_**.

 



 

 **3.1 Representations and Warranties of the Macerich Parties**. The Macerich
Parties jointly and severally represent to 1700480 as follows:

 



 

 **3.1.1 Organization**. Each of the Macerich Parties has been duly formed or
incorporated, as applicable, and is validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, with corporate or
other entity power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
conduct its business as described in Macerichs most recent periodic filings
(the " **Exchange Act Reports** ") filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " **Commission** ") pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the " **Exchange Act** "). Each Macerich Subsidiary (as
defined below) is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization, with corporate or other entity power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its business as
described in Macerichs most recent Exchange Act Reports, except where the
failure or absence, individually or in the aggregate, does not and would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the results of
operations, net worth, business, properties, or condition (financial or
otherwise) of Macerich and the Macerich Subsidiaries (defined below), taken as
a whole (such effect, a " **Material Adverse Effect** "). For the avoidance of
doubt, the expression "would not reasonably be expected" or the like whenever
used in this Agreement shall be interpreted to mean what a reasonable person
with actual knowledge of the relevant facts at the time of Closing would be
able to anticipate under the circumstances would occur within a reasonably
short period of time. Each of the Macerich Parties and each other Macerich
Subsidiary is duly registered and qualified to transact business in all
jurisdictions in which the conduct of its business requires such registration
or qualification, except where the failure so to

 



      
 

 



 

register or qualify, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to interfere in any material respect with any Macerich Partys
ability to enter into this Agreement and the agreements and other instruments
being entered into by any of them concurrently herewith or pursuant to the
terms hereof (collectively, the " **Related Agreements** ") or to perform its
obligations hereunder or thereunder and except where the failure so to
register or qualify, individually or in the aggregate, does not and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. As used herein, the
term "Macerich Subsidiary" means any entity listed in Macerichs most recent
Exchange Act Reports as a subsidiary of Macerich or The Macerich Partnership,
L.P. (the " **Operating Partnership** ") and the term " **Macerich
Subsidiaries** " has the meaning correlative thereto.

 



 

 **3.1.2 Authority/Consent**. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Related Agreements (the " **Transactions** ") have been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of the Macerich Parties and
their direct and indirect owners, as applicable, and this Agreement, and each
of the Related Agreements to which any Macerich Party is a party has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by each such Macerich Party. This Agreement
constitutes, and each of the Related Agreements constitutes or shall
constitute, when executed and delivered, the valid, legal and binding
obligations of the applicable Macerich Party, enforceable against the
applicable Macerich Party in accordance with their respective terms, subject
as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to
general equity principles. Other than such consents, approvals,
authorizations, declarations or filings as have already been obtained or made
or which will be made concurrent with the Closing, no consent, approval or
authorization of, or declaration or filing with, any regulatory,
administrative or other governmental authority on the part of any Macerich
Party is required for the valid execution and delivery of this Agreement or
any of the Related Agreements or for the performance hereunder or thereunder
or for the valid offer, issue, sale and delivery of the Purchased Macerich
Shares pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

 **3.1.3 Litigation**. No action, suit or other proceeding is pending or, to
any of the Macerich Parties knowledge, has been threatened overtly or in
writing that concerns or involves the Purchased Macerich Shares, or that
restricts or inhibits, or would reasonably be expected to restrict or inhibit,
any of the Macerich Parties right or ability to enter into this Agreement or
perform its respective obligations hereunder or that otherwise has resulted in
or would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. There
is no action, suit, claim or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of any of
the Macerich Parties, threatened overtly or in writing, against any Macerich
Party or any other Macerich Subsidiary before any court or administrative
agency or otherwise that is required to be described in the Exchange Act
Reports, which has not been so described as required.

 



 

 **3.1.4 Bankruptcy**. No bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar
action or proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, is pending, or, to the
Macerich Parties knowledge, threatened in writing, against any of the
Macerich Parties or any other Macerich Subsidiary.

 



 

 **3.1.5 JV Interests**. Each of the JV Interests has been duly authorized,
validly issued and is outstanding as of the date hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

 **3.1.6 Capitalization; Valid Issuance of Purchased Macerich Shares;
Securities Law Compliance**. Macerich has an authorized capitalization as set
forth in Macerichs most recent Exchange Act Reports and all of the issued and
outstanding shares of stock of Macerich have been duly and validly authorized
and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. All of the partnership
interests of the Operating Partnership have been duly and validly authorized
and issued, are fully paid and the percentage owned of record by Macerich is
as set forth in Macerichs most recent Exchange Act Reports. The partnership
interests of the Operating Partnership owned by Macerich are owned by Macerich
free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims. Except as set
forth in Macerichs most recent Exchange Act Reports, there are no contracts,
agreements or understandings between Macerich and any other person or entity
granting such person or entity the right to require Macerich or any Macerich
Subsidiary to file a registration statement under the Securities Act with
respect to any securities of Macerich or any Macerich Subsidiary owned or to
be owned by such person or entity or require Macerich to include such
securities in any registration statement filed by Macerich under the
Securities Act. The Purchased Macerich Shares, when issued, sold and delivered
in accordance with the terms hereof for the consideration stated herein, will
be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Assuming the
accuracy of 1700480s representations set forth in Section 3.2.9, it is not
necessary in connection with the offer, sale and delivery of the Purchased
Macerich Shares in the manner contemplated by this Agreement to register the
Purchased Macerich Shares under the Securities Act. None of Macerich or any
Macerich Subsidiary, or any person or entity on behalf of any of them, has
engaged, directly or indirectly, in any form of general solicitation or
general advertising in connection with the offering and sale of the Purchased
Macerich Shares.

 



 

 **3.1.7 Macerich Financial Statements**.

 



 

(a) The consolidated financial statements of Macerich and the Macerich
Subsidiaries, together with related notes and schedules as set forth or
incorporated by reference in the Exchange Act Reports, present fairly the
