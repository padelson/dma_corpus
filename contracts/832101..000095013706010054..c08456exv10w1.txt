accountants  ("Buyer\'s Accountants") as to reasonableness. The Closing shall
proceed,  and the payments required to be made at the Closing pursuant to
Section 1.2  shall be determined on the basis of the Closing Certificate and
the Initial  Purchase Price Closing Adjustment.   (b) The Initial Purchase
Price Closing Adjustment shall be determined  as follows:   (i) If Adjusted
Working Capital, as reflected on the Closing  Certificate, is greater than
$11,952,336, the Initial Purchase Price  Closing Adjustment will be, and the

Sellers at or prior to the  Closing Date and inclusive of the Company\'s
deposit under Section 444 of  the Code (as hereinafter defined)), minus (ii)
total current liabilities  (exclusive of any notes or other debt obligations
payable to any Seller,  which shall be settled at or prior to the Closing),
in each case as of the  opening of business on the Closing Date and
calculated and presented on a  basis consistent with the Company\'s audited
financial statements for the  year ended September 30, 2005.   (d) As
promptly as practicable (but in any event within 30 days)  after the Closing,
Sellers shall cause the Company\'s current independent  accountants (the
"Company\'s Accountants") to prepare without audit and  deliver to Buyer a
balance sheet of the Company as of the opening of  business on the Closing
Date (the "Preliminary Closing Date Balance  Sheet"), which shall be prepared
and presented on a basis consistent with  the Company\'s audited financial
statements for the year ended September 30,  2005. Upon receipt of the
Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet, Buyer and  Buyer\'s Accountants shall
be permitted during the succeeding 30-day period  to have reasonable access
during normal business hours to the Company\'s  Accountants and to the work
papers and other documents prepared or  information used in the preparation
of the Preliminary Closing Date Balance  Sheet. At or prior to the end of
such 30-day period, Buyer shall either  inform the Seller Representative in
writing that the Preliminary Closing  Date Balance Sheet is acceptable or
object to it in writing setting forth a  specific description of Buyer\'s
objections. If Buyer objects to the  Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet
as provided above, Buyer and Sellers  shall attempt to resolve any such
objections within 20 days after the  Seller Representative\'s receipt of such
written objections. If Buyer and  Sellers are unable to resolve the disputed
matters within such 20-day  period, they shall jointly select and engage
Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP as  a third firm of independent accountants (the
"Third Accountants") to  resolve the disputes and to make any adjustments to
the Preliminary Closing  Date Balance Sheet. Buyer, Sellers, Buyer\'s
Accountants and the Company\'s  Accountants each shall make readily available
to the Third Accountants all  relevant books, records, work papers and
personnel reasonably requested by  the Third Accountants. The Third
Accountants\' resolution of the disputes  and its adjustments, if any, to the
Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet  shall be limited to the matters in
dispute between Sellers and Buyer and  shall be conclusive and binding upon
the parties. The final Closing Date  Balance Sheet, in the form either
accepted by Buyer or resolved and  adjusted (if adjusted) by the Third
Accountants, as the case may be, is  herein called the "Closing Date Balance
Sheet" for all purposes of this  Agreement. The fees and expenses of the
Third Accountants, if any, shall be  paid equally by Buyer, on the one hand,
and Sellers on the other hand.    -3-      (e) Within two business
days after the final determination of the  Closing Date Balance Sheet as
provided for in subsection (d) above, Buyer  or Sellers, as applicable, shall
make payment to the other by wire transfer  of immediately available funds,
as follows:   (i) If Adjusted Working Capital as reflected on the Closing 
Date Balance Sheet is greater than Adjusted Working Capital as  reflected on
the Closing Certificate, then Buyer shall pay the amount  of such difference
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to  an account for Sellers to
be designated in writing by the Seller  Representative.   (ii) If Adjusted
Working Capital as reflected on the Closing  Date Balance Sheet is less than
Adjusted Working Capital as reflected  on the Closing Certificate, then the
parties shall instruct the escrow  agent under the Escrow Agreement to
distribute the amount of such  difference to Buyer from escrow.   (f) Any
amount paid by either party pursuant to this Section 1.3  shall be deemed for
all purposes to be an upward or downward, as  applicable, adjustment of the
Purchase Price.   ARTICLE II   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF

of any corporation or any other entity (except that they may own
securities constituting less than three percent (3%) of any class of
securities of a public company), or member of any firm or otherwise, engage
or attempt to engage in the activities which the Company is presently
conducting or pursuing, including, without limitation, the design and   
-22-    manufacturing of liquid handling products, including valves,
fittings, pumps, couplings, strainer/filters, systems and accessories (the
"Business") anywhere in the world where the Company conducts the
Business.  4.11 NON-SOLICITATION.   Each Seller agrees that, beginning on
the Closing Date and continuing until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, he, she or it shall not, directly or indirectly, for his, her
or its own account or as agent, employee, officer, director, trustee,
consultant, partner, stockholder or equity owner of any corporation or any
other entity (a) employ or solicit the employment of any person who was
employed by the Company at the Closing Date, except that Sellers shall be
free to employ or solicit the employment of any such person whose employment
with the Company has terminated for any reason (without any interference from
Sellers thereof) and, unless Buyer shall otherwise consent in writing, who
has not been employed by the Company for at least six (6) months, (b) canvass
or solicit business in competition with the Business from any person or
entity who during the six (6) month period preceding the Closing Date
shall have been a customer of the Company, (c) willfully dissuade or

gained knowledge with respect to the Business, including without limitation
trade secrets, financial results and information, processes and techniques,
technical production and cost data, methods of doing business and information
concerning customers and suppliers, and other valuable and confidential
information relating to the Business (the "Confidential Information").
Sellers acknowledge that unauthorized disclosure or misuse of the
Confidential Information, whether before or after the Closing, will cause
irreparable damage to the Company and Buyer subsequent to the Closing. The
parties also agree that covenants by Sellers not to make unauthorized
disclosures of the Confidential Information are essential to the growth and
stability of the business of the Company and Buyer. Accordingly, each Seller
agrees that he, she or it will not use or disclose any
Confidential Information obtained in the course of his, her or its past
connection with the Business, other than information generally available to
the public through sources other than Sellers, except in connection with the
performance of his or her obligations, if any, as an employee of the
Company.  4.13 EQUITABLE REMEDIES/REASONABLENESS OF LIMITATIONS.   Each
Seller acknowledges that (a) a remedy at law for his, her or its failure to
comply with the covenants contained in Sections 4.4, 4.10, 4.11 and 4.12 may
be inadequate and (b) in the event of any such failure, Buyer shall
be entitled to seek and obtain from a court having jurisdiction
specific performance, an injunction, a restraining order or any other
equitable relief in order to enforce any such provision. The right to obtain
such equitable relief shall be in addition to any other remedy to which Buyer
is entitled under applicable law (including, but not limited to, monetary
damages). Each Seller represents and warrants that he, she or it has had an
opportunity to consult with counsel regarding this Agreement, has fully and
completely reviewed    -23-    this Agreement with such counsel and
fully understands the contents hereof. Each Seller agrees that the
territorial, time and other limitations contained in this Agreement are
reasonable and properly required for the adequate protection of the business
and affairs of Buyer, and in the event that any one or more of
such territorial, time or other limitations is found to be unreasonable by a
court of competent jurisdiction, each Seller agrees to submit to the
reduction of said territorial, time or other limitations to such an area,
period or otherwise as the court may determine to be reasonable. In the event
that any limitation under this Agreement is found to be unreasonable or
otherwise invalid in any jurisdiction, in whole or in part, each Seller
acknowledges and agrees that such limitation shall remain and be valid in all
other jurisdictions.  4.14 USE OF CORPORATE NAME OR TRADE NAME.   After
the Closing, Sellers will not use or refer to the name "Banjo" or any trade
name included within the Intellectual Property, or any derivative or
variation thereof or any name similar thereto except in connection with
the performance of their obligations, if any, as officers or employees of
the Company.  4.15 LIABILITY INSURANCE.   Sellers shall purchase and
maintain tail coverages for the existing liability insurance coverages of the
Company for a period of two (2) years after the Closing. At the Closing,
Buyer shall pay, or shall reimburse Sellers for, twenty-five percent (25%) of
the cost of such tail coverages.  4.16 NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS.  
Sellers shall give prompt written notice to Buyer of (a) any fact
or circumstance, or any occurrence or failure to occur of any event of
which Sellers have knowledge, which fact, circumstance, occurrence or failure
causes or, with notice or the lapse of time, would cause any representation
or warranty of Sellers contained in this Agreement to be breached or untrue
or inaccurate in any respect any time from the date of this Agreement to the
Closing and (b) any failure of Sellers to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by Sellers
under this Agreement.   ARTICLE V   TAX MATTERS  5.1 AUDITS, ETC.  
Each party hereto agrees to promptly notify the other party upon receipt of
notice of any Audit of the Company for any taxable year or period ending
prior to or including the Closing Date, and agree to furnish or cause to be
furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable,
such information (including access to books and records) and assistance
relating to the Company as is reasonably necessary for the preparation and
filing of any Tax Return, for the preparation for any Audit, and for the
prosecution or defense of any claim, action, suit or other proceeding
relating to any proposed adjustment of Taxes. The parties shall cooperate
with each other in the conduct of any Audit and each shall execute and
deliver such    -24-    powers of attorney and other documents as are
necessary to carry out the intent of this Section; provided, that
notwithstanding anything herein or in Article VI to the contrary, Buyer, in
good faith consultation with the Seller Representative, shall have the right
to control and direct the manner and the resolution of any Audit involving
the Company.  5.2 OTHER TAX MATTERS   (a) Tax Periods Ending on or Before
the Closing Date. Sellers  shall prepare or cause to be prepared and shall
file or cause to be filed  all Tax Returns for the Company for all periods
ending on or prior to the  Closing Date that are filed after the Closing
Date. Sellers shall provide a  copy of such Tax Returns and copies of the
work papers and other documents  prepared or information used in the
preparation of such Tax Returns for  Buyer\'s review at least fifteen (15)
days prior to the date for filing such  Tax Returns. To the extent permitted
by applicable law, Sellers shall  include any income, gain, loss, deduction
or other tax items for such  periods on their Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the Schedule K-1s  furnished by the Company to Sellers for
such periods. Sellers shall  reimburse Buyer for any income Tax liability
with respect to such periods  within fifteen (15) days after payment by Buyer
or the Company of such  income Tax liability to the extent such income Tax
liability is not  reflected in the Closing Date Balance Sheet and used in
calculating the  Adjusted Working Capital.   (b) Tax Periods Beginning
Before and Ending After the Closing  Date. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and shall file or cause  to be filed any Tax Returns of the Company
for Tax periods that begin  before the Closing Date and end after the Closing
Date. Buyer shall provide  a copy of such Tax Returns for Sellers\' review at
least fifteen (15) days  prior to the date for filing such Tax Returns.
Sellers shall pay to Buyer  within fifteen (15) days after the date on which
Taxes are paid with  respect to such periods an amount equal to the portion
of such Taxes which  relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the
Closing Date, to  the extent such Taxes are not reflected in the Closing Date
Balance Sheet  and used in calculating the Adjusted Working Capital. For
purposes of this  Section 5.2, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis  and are payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not
end on) the  Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which relates to the
portion of such  Tax period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case
of any Taxes  other than Taxes based upon or related to income, receipts,
wages, capital  expenditures, or expenses, be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the  entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the  number of days in the portion of the Tax period that ends on
the Closing  Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire Tax  period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to
income,  receipts, wages, capital expenditures, or expenses, be deemed equal
to the  amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on
the  Closing Date. Any credits relating to a Tax period that begins before
and  ends after the Closing Date shall be taken into account as though the 
relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date.   (c) Cooperation In
Connection With Tax Matters. Buyer, Sellers  and the Company shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably  requested by the other parties, in
connection with the filing of Tax  Returns pursuant to this Section 5.2 and
any audit, claim, action, suit or  other proceeding with respect to Taxes.
Such cooperation    -25-     shall include the retention and (upon
another party\'s request) the  provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any  such audit, claim, action, suit or other
proceeding and making employees  available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information  and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Sellers and Buyer agree  to, and agree to cause the Company to (i)
retain all books and records with  respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Company relating to any Tax period  beginning before the Closing Date until
the expiration of the statute of  limitations (and, to the extent notified by
Buyer or Seller, any extensions  thereof) of the respective Tax periods, and
to abide by all record  retention agreements entered into with any Tax
authority, and (ii) give the  other parties reasonable written notice prior
to transferring, destroying,  or discarding any such books and records. Buyer
and Sellers further agree,  upon request, to use their best efforts to obtain
any certificate or other  document from any Governmental Entity or any other
person as may be  necessary to mitigate, reduce, or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed  (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions  contemplated under this Agreement).   ARTICLE VI

a claim based on a relationship with any other  shareholder or other equity
owner of the Company;   (iii) any and all Losses suffered or incurred by any
of them  arising from any indebtedness, liability or obligation of the

except to the extent reflected in the Closing Date Balance  Sheet and used in
calculating the Adjusted Working Capital; and   (iv) any and all Losses
suffered or incurred by any of them  attributable to (A) any of the matters
disclosed in Section 2.14 of  the Disclosure Schedule or (B) with respect to

business.  6.2 TAX INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) Sellers, jointly and severally,
shall defend, indemnify and  hold Buyer and the Company harmless from,
against and with respect to any  and all Taxes that may be imposed upon or
assessed against the Company or  Buyer or the assets of the Company (A) based
on income attributable to any  period ending on or prior to the Closing Date
(including, without  limitation, any tax imposed by reason of the
transactions contemplated by  this Agreement), (B) based on operations of the
Company on or prior to the  Closing Date or (C) arising by reason of any
breach by Sellers of any of  the representations contained in Section 2.15,

foreign income, business and  occupation or similar Taxes owing by the
Company to any Governmental Entity  attributable to the operations and
activities of, or otherwise incurred by  or existing with respect to, the
Company for any period ending on or prior  to the Closing Date, except, in
each case, to the extent fully reflected on  the Closing Date Balance Sheet
and used in calculating the Adjusted Working  Capital.   (b) Any claim for
indemnity under this Section 6.2 may be made at  any time prior to sixty (60)
days after the expiration of the applicable  tax statute of limitations with
respect to the relevant taxable period  (including all periods of extension,
whether automatic or permissive).  6.3 CERTAIN LIMITATIONS.   (a) The
indemnification obligations of Sellers under Section  6.1(b) shall not apply
to the first $1,000,000, in the aggregate, of Losses  referred to therein,
except to the extent that such Losses may be incurred  by virtue of or result
from fraud or intentional misrepresentation.    -27-     (b) The
indemnification obligations of Sellers under Sections  6.1(b) shall not
exceed $10,000,000 in the aggregate, and the  indemnification obligations of
each Seller under this Article VI shall not  exceed the aggregate Purchase
Price received by such Seller for his, her or  its Shares; provided however,
that the foregoing limitations shall not  apply to any Losses resulting from
a breach of the representations and  warranties contained in Section 2.4
(Capitalization of the Company;  Subsidiaries and Investments) or Section
2.7(a) (Ownership and Condition of  Assets) or that that may be incurred by
virtue of or result from fraud or  intentional misrepresentation.   (c) All
representations and warranties of Sellers contained in  this Agreement shall
survive the Closing for a period of eighteen (18)  months (the "Claims
Period"): except that (A) the representations and  warranties in Section 2.4
(Capitalization of the Company; Subsidiaries and  Investments) and Section
2.7(a) (Ownership and Condition of Assets) shall  survive the Closing
indefinitely and (B) the representations and warranties  in Section 2.18
(Environmental Matters) and Section 2.15 (Taxes) shall  survive the Closing
for a period of six (6) years from the date Sellers  file the last tax return
described in Section 5.2(a). Any claim made by  Buyer with respect to the
representations and warranties of Sellers  contained in this Agreement must
be initiated by Buyer during the Claims  Period, except that any claim with
respect to the representations and  warranties in Section 2.18 (Environmental

following the filing by  Sellers of the last tax return required to be filed
pursuant to Section  5.2(a) of this Agreement and there shall be no time
limit on when claims  may be initiated with respect to the representations

and  agreements made by Sellers contained in this Agreement (including,

indemnification by Sellers  hereunder shall be reduced by the amount of any
insurance proceeds received  by Buyer or the Company in respect of such Loss
(net of retrospective  premium payment or prospective premium
increases).  6.4 DEFENSE OF CLAIMS.   (a) As used in this Section 6.4, any
party seeking  indemnification pursuant to this Article VI is referred to as
an  "Indemnified Party" and any party from whom indemnification is sought 
pursuant to this Article VI is referred to as an "Indemnifying Party." An 
Indemnified Party which proposes to assert the right to be indemnified  under
this Article VI shall submit a written demand for indemnification to  the
Indemnifying Party as promptly as practicable after its discovery of  grounds
for indemnification hereunder, setting forth in summary form the  facts as
then known which form the basis for the claim for indemnification;  provided,
however, that the failure to    -28-     give such notice will not
affect such claim of indemnification except to  the extent of actual
prejudice to the Indemnifying Party. With respect to  claims based on actions
by third parties, an Indemnified Party shall,  within fifteen (15) days after
the receipt of notice of the commencement of  any claim, action, suit or
other proceeding against it in respect of which  a claim for indemnification
is to be made against an Indemnifying Party,  notify the Indemnifying Party
in writing of the commencement of such claim,  action, suit or other
proceeding, enclosing a copy of all papers served;  provided, however, that
the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party of  any such claim, action,
suit or other proceeding shall not relieve the  Indemnifying Party from any
liability which it may have to the Indemnified  Party, except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced  thereby. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the  Indemnifying Party, within fifteen
(15) days after receipt by the  Indemnified Party, copies of all further
notices relating to such claim.   (b) With respect to claims based on
actions by third parties,  Sellers may, at their option, upon providing to
Buyer written  acknowledgment of their obligation to indemnify each
Indemnified Party for  all Losses arising with respect to such claim pursuant
to this Article VI,  assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to  Buyer, at the sole cost and expense of Sellers unless (i)
such claim seeks  an order, injunction or other equitable relief against
Buyer or the  Company, (ii) Buyer shall have reasonably concluded that there
is a  conflict of interest between Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer or
the  Company, on the other hand, in the defense of such claim or (iii) the 
amount of potential exposure with respect to such claim exceeds the amounts 
remaining with the escrow agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (A) minus 
the amount of all prior claims delivered to the escrow agent by Buyer which 
remain unresolved and (B) plus the amount of any bond or other security 
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer posted by Seller Representative upon the 
assumption of such defense. After any assumption of the defense of any  claim
by Sellers, Sellers shall not be liable to Buyer for any legal  expenses
thereafter incurred by Buyer in connection with the defense  thereof other
than reasonable costs of investigation and any costs incurred  in the course
of such defense. In any such event, whether or not Sellers do  so assume the
defense thereof, Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate in the  defense thereof
and shall furnish such records and information and attend  at such
proceedings as may be reasonably requested in connection herewith.  Subject
to Section 6.4(c) below, unless Seller Representative unreasonably  withholds
such consent Sellers shall have no indemnification obligations  with respect
to any claim or demand that is settled by Buyer without the  prior written
consent of the Seller Representative (which consent shall not  be
unreasonably withheld).   (c) In the event that Buyer proposes to settle any
third party  claim by any person other than a Governmental Entity, then Buyer
shall give  the Seller Representative ten (10) business days\' prior written
notice of  such proposed settlement, together with a description of such
claim and the  principal terms of the proposed settlement in reasonable
detail. During  such ten (10) business day period, Buyer shall provide to the
Seller  Representative any additional information requested by the Seller 
Representative that he reasonably deems necessary to make a determination 
whether to accept or reject such proposed settlement. The Seller 
Representative shall notify Buyer prior to the end of such ten (10)  business
day period as to whether Sellers accept or reject    -29-     such
proposed settlement; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything  to the
contrary contained in this Article VI, if Sellers reject the  proposed
settlement, Sellers shall at the time of such rejection  acknowledge their
obligation to indemnify Buyer for all Losses arising with  respect to such
claim pursuant to this Article VI and shall at such time  also post a
performance bond, letter of credit or other similar security in  each case
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer in an amount which equals, the  excess of
(i) the amount by which the amount claimed pursuant to such third  party
claim or, if greater, the potential liability arising out of such  third
party claim (in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party),  exceeds
the proposed settlement amount over (ii) the amount, if any,  remaining with
the escrow agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (A) minus  the amount of
all prior claims delivered to the escrow agent by Buyer which  remain
unresolved and (B) plus the amount of any bond or other security  previously
posted by Sellers upon any assumption of the defense of such  claim by
Sellers pursuant to Section 6.4(b) above.   (d) In the event that any claim
for indemnification is made with  respect to any third party claim pursuant
to this Article VI, (A) the party  assuming primary responsibility for the
defense of such claim shall at all  times keep the other party reasonably
informed as to the status of such  claim and (B) the party not primarily
responsible for the defense of such  claim shall cooperate folly with the
other party in connection with such  defense.  6.5 EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.  
The rights of indemnification of Buyer under this Article VI shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy available to Buyer and its affiliates, and
the directors, officers and employees of Buyer and its affiliates, for any
Losses incurred by any of them after the Closing as a result of any breach by
any Seller of its representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set
forth in this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby except for fraud or intentional misrepresentation;
provided, however, that this Section 6.5, shall not preclude or limit Buyer
from the exercise of all available equitable remedies in the event of any
breach by any Seller of its covenants to be performed after the Closing
Date.  6.6 ESCROW AGREEMENT.   All Losses incurred by Buyer that are
subject to indemnification hereunder shall be payable first from the funds
being held in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, to the extent of such
funds, as provided for in the Escrow Agreement.   ARTICLE VII

Representative") as such Seller\'s  true and lawful agent, proxy and
attorney-in-fact and agent and authorizes  the Seller Representative acting
for    -36-     such Seller and in such Seller\'s name, place and
stead, in any and all  capacities to do and perform every act and thing
required or permitted to  be done in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement  and the Escrow Agreement, as fully to all
intents and purposes as such  Person might or could do in person, including,
without limitation, to (i)  consummate the transactions contemplated herein,
and in the event of such  consummation, to receive payment on behalf of such
Seller for the Shares,  (ii) pay such Seller\'s expenses (whether incurred on
or after the date  hereof) incurred in connection with the performance of
this Agreement and  the Escrow Agreement, it being understood that such
expenses shall be  allocated among the Sellers based upon each Seller\'s
proportionate  shareholdings, (iii) disburse any funds received hereunder to
such Seller  and each other Seller, (iv) execute and deliver the Escrow
Agreement and  any other Contracts contemplated herein and any certificates
or other  documents required hereunder, including delivery of any stock

otherwise  handle all claims for indemnification made by Buyer pursuant to
this  Agreement and (ix) do each and every act and exercise any and all
rights  which such Seller or the Sellers (collectively) are permitted or
required  to do or exercise under this Agreement. Each Seller grants unto
said  attorney-in-fact and agent full power and authority to do and perform
each  and every act and thing necessary or desirable to be done in
connection  with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as fully to
all  intents and purposes as the undersigned might or could do in person,
hereby  ratifying and confirming all that the Seller Representative may
lawfully do  or cause to be done by virtue hereof. Each Seller will, by
executing this  Agreement agree that such agency, proxy and power of attorney
are coupled  with an interest, and are therefore irrevocable without the
consent of the  Seller Representative and shall survive the death,
incapacity, or  bankruptcy of such Seller. Each Seller acknowledges and
agrees that upon  execution of this Agreement, any delivery by the Seller
Representative of  any waiver, amendment, agreement, opinion, certificate or
other documents  executed by the Seller Representative or any decisions made
by the Seller  Representative pursuant to this Section 9.13, such Seller
shall be bound by  such documents or decision as fully as if such Seller had
executed and  delivered such documents or made such decisions.   (b) No
Fiduciary Relationship. The Seller Representative shall  not have by reason
of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of  any Seller, except
in respect of amounts received on behalf of such Seller.  The Seller
Representative shall not be liable to any Seller for any action  taken or
omitted by him or any agent employed by him hereunder or under any  other
document or agreement in connection therewith, except that the Seller 
Representative shall not be relieved of any liability imposed by law for 
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Seller Representative shall not 
be liable to Sellers for any apportionment or distribution of payments made 
by the Seller Representative in good faith, and if any such apportionment  or
distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the  sole
recourse of any Seller to whom payment was due, but not made, shall be  to
recover from other Sellers any    -37-     payment in excess of the
amount to which they are determined to have been  entitled. The Seller
Representative shall not be required to make any  inquiry concerning either
the performance of observance of any of the  terms, provisions or conditions
of this Agreement.   (c) Replacement of the Seller Representative. Upon the
death,  disability or incapacity of the initial Seller Representative
appointed  pursuant to Section 9.13(a) above, each Seller acknowledges and
agrees the  Majority Sellers shall promptly appoint a replacement Seller
Representative  hereunder within ten (10) days. In the event that the Seller
Representative  resigns for any reason, the Majority Sellers shall promptly
appoint another  representative to fill such vacancy. Any substituted
representative shall  be deemed the Seller Representative for all purposes of
this Agreement and  the documents executed in connection with this
Agreement.   (d) Actions of the Seller Representative; Liability of the
Seller  Representative. Each Seller agrees that Buyer shall be entitled to
rely on  any action taken by the Seller Representative, on behalf of
Sellers,  pursuant to this Agreement (each, an "Authorized Action"), and that
each  Authorized Action shall be binding on each Seller as fully as if such 
Seller had taken such Authorized Action. Buyer agrees that the Seller 
Representative shall have no liability to Buyer for any Authorized Action, 
except to the extent that such Authorized Action is found by a final order 
of a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted fraud or willful 
misconduct. Sellers jointly and severally agree to pay, and to indemnify  and
hold harmless Buyer from and against any losses which they may suffer, 
sustain, or become subject to, as the result of any claim by any Person  that
an Authorized Action is not binding on, or enforceable against,  Sellers. In
addition, Sellers hereby release and discharge Buyer from and  against any
liability arising out of or in connection with the Seller  Representative\'s
failure to distribute any amounts received by the Seller  Representative on
Sellers\' behalf to Sellers.   [REMAINDER OF PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT   THIS AGREEMENT, dated as of October ___, 2006, is
between BANJO CORPORATION, an Indiana corporation (the "Company") and MICHAEL
D. BOWMAN, an individual residing at 7207 Windridge Way, Brownsburg, IN 46112
(the "Executive").   INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT.   The Executive has been
serving as President of the Company. Pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement
(the "Purchase Agreement") dated as of [September ___, 2006] between IDEX
Corporation ("IDEX") and the shareholders of the Company, the Company is
becoming a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of IDEX. From and after
the date of this Agreement, the Company will conduct the Business (as defined
in Section 10). It is intended that this Agreement will be dated and become
effective as of and only upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by
the Purchase Agreement. As inducements to enter into this Agreement,
Executive receives additional compensation, including but not limited to that
provided in Sections 3(b), 3(c) and 15(c), and the Company
receives additional rights, including but not limited to those provided in
Sections 7 through 14, and the Executive and the Company acknowledge that
IDEX and its Affiliates are intended to be third party beneficiaries of
certain rights under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, those
provided in Section 7 through 14. Therefore, in consideration of the mutual
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the Company and the
Executive agree as follows:   1. EMPLOYMENT; TERM.   Subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees to
employ the Executive, and the Executive hereby accepts such employment, for
the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing for a
period of four (4) years (the "Initial Term"), subject to earlier termination
of the Executive\'s employment as provided in this Agreement. Upon the
expiration of the Initial Term, the term of this Agreement shall be renewed
automatically for successive additional one-year periods (each such renewal
period being referred to as an "Extended Term") unless either the Company or
the Executive delivers written notice to the other party that it does not
intend to renew this Agreement, at least 30 days prior to the end of
the Initial Term or an Extended Term, as the case may be (the "Non-Renewal
Notice"). In the event that either the Company or the Executive delivers a
Non-Renewal Notice, this Agreement shall terminate upon the expiration of the
then-current Initial Term or Extended Term, as the case may be. As used
herein, the "term" of this Agreement shall include the Initial Term and each
Extended Term, if any.   2. DUTIES.   (a) The Executive shall serve as the
chief executive officer of the Company and, subject to the supervision and
authority of the Board of Directors, shall have the powers and perform the
duties of supervision and management which ordinarily appertain to the office
of     -2-   President of a corporation and as the Board of Directors
of the Company shall from time to time reasonably direct commensurate with
the Executive\'s position. The Company and the Executive agree that, during
the term of Executive\'s employment, the Executive shall serve as President
and as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company and Executive will
report to the Board of Directors of the Company. The Executive agrees to
perform Executive\'s duties and discharge Executive\'s responsibilities in a
faithful manner and to the best of Executive\'s ability and to use all
reasonable efforts to promote the interests of the Company and its Business.
The Executive further agrees that, during the term of Executive\'s
employment, Executive will devote substantially all of Executive\'s skill,
knowledge and business time and attention to the performance of Executive\'s
duties under this Agreement; provided however, that to the extent it does not
materially interfere with the Executive\'s performance of, or ability
to perform, any of Executive\'s duties and obligations under this Agreement,
it shall not be a violation of this Agreement for the Executive to (i) serve
on any other corporate, civic or charitable boards or committees, if and to
the extent approved in advance by the Board of Directors of the Company and
(ii) manage personal investments.   (b) The Executive represents and
warrants that Executive is entering into this Agreement voluntarily and that
Executive\'s employment hereunder and compliance by Executive with the terms
of this Agreement will not conflict with or result in the breach of any
agreement to which Executive is a party or by which Executive is bound.  
3. COMPENSATION.   (a) During the term of the Executive\'s employment under
this Agreement, the Executive shall receive an annual base salary of
$200,000, payable in accordance with the regular payroll practices of the
local business unit. Such annual base salary will be subject to review and
possible increase (but not decrease) by the Company on or about each
anniversary of the date of this Agreement. Any and all increases in the level
of the base salary as provided for in the preceding sentence shall become the
level of the base salary for the remainder of the term until there is a
further increase in the base salary as provided for herein.   (b) During the
term of the Executive\'s employment under this Agreement, the Executive shall
be entitled to annual bonus payments in accordance with IDEX\'s Management
Incentive Compensation Plan applicable to the officers of its subsidiaries,
as such Plan is administered and from time to time modified by IDEX in its
sole discretion. The annual bonus would be targeted to be 45% of
the Executive\'s base salary at targeted levels of operation and would
otherwise be based upon the criteria set forth in the IDEX Management
Incentive Compensation Plan. Any annual bonus for calendar year 2006 will be
prorated based on the partial year between the date of this Agreement and
December 31, 2006.     -3-    (c) As of the effective date of this
Agreement, IDEX and Executive shall enter into a Restricted Stock Award (in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit A) with respect to 16,000 shares of the
IDEX\'s common stock. Commencing not later than 2007, the Executive will be
annually considered for long-term incentive awards.   (d) The Company shall
deduct or withhold from all salary payments, and from all other payments made
to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement, all amounts which may be
required to be deducted or withheld under any applicable Social Security
contribution, income tax withholding or other similar law now in effect or
which may become effective during the term of this Agreement.   4. OTHER
BENEFITS AND TERMS.   During the term of the Executive\'s employment under
this Agreement, the Executive shall be entitled to the following other
benefits and terms:   (a) The Company shall provide to the Executive, and
the Executive shall be entitled to participate in, any health and medical
benefit plans, any pension, profit sharing and retirement plans, and any
insurance policies or programs from time to time offered to employees of
comparable status to the Executive who are employed by the Company. These
plans, policies and programs are subject to change at the sole discretion of
the Company, provided that such plans, policies and programs, in the
aggregate, will be no less valuable than those offered by the Company as of
the date of this Agreement.   (b) The Executive shall be entitled to any
other fringe benefit from time to time offered to employees of comparable
status to the Executive who are employed by the Company (including, but not
limited to, the use of an automobile to the extent so offered to such
employees). Such fringe benefits are subject to change at the sole discretion
of the Company, provided that such fringe benefits, in the aggregate, will be
no less valuable than those offered by the Company as of the date of this
Agreement.   5. VACATIONS.   The Executive shall be entitled to four (4)
weeks of paid vacation each year. All such vacations shall be taken at such
times as shall be agreed upon by the Board of Directors of the Company and
Executive. Vacation time may not be carried over to the subsequent calendar
year without prior approval of the Board of Directors of the Company.    
-4-    6. REIMBURSEMENT FOR EXPENSES.   The Company shall reimburse the
Executive for expenses which the Executive may from time to time reasonably
incur on behalf of the Company in the performance of his responsibilities and
duties under this Agreement; provided however, that the Executive shall be
required to account to the Company for such expenses in the manner prescribed
by the Company.   7. NON-COMPETITION.   In consideration of the
compensation and other benefits to be paid to the Executive under this
Agreement and to induce the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, the Executive agrees that, beginning
on the date of this Agreement and continuing until the Covenant Expiration
Date (as defined in Section 10), Executive shall not, directly or indirectly,
for Executive\'s own account or as agent, employee, officer, director,
trustee, consultant, partner, stockholder or equity owner of any corporation
or any other entity (except that Executive may own securities constituting
less than three percent (3%) of any class of securities of a public company),
or member of any firm or otherwise, engage or attempt to engage, in the
Restricted Territory (as defined in Section 10), in the Business or any other
business activity which is competitive with the business conducted by
the Company at the Reference Date (as defined in Section 10).   8. NON-
SOLICITATION.   In consideration of the compensation and other benefits to
be paid to the Executive under this Agreement and to induce IDEX and the
Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Purchase
Agreement, the Executive agrees that, beginning on the date of this Agreement
and continuing until the Covenant Expiration Date (as defined in Section 10),
Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, for Executive\'s own account or

abandoned prior to issuance of a patent, copyright or other proprietary right
registration.   (c) The Executive shall, at the Company\'s expense, take
such action, including, but not limited to, execution, acknowledgment,
delivery and assistance in preparation of documentation, as may reasonably be
requested by the Company or its Affiliates for the implementation or
continuing performance of subsection 13(b) of this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Executive shall execute,
acknowledge, deliver and assist in preparing such instruments of conveyance,
patent or copyright application, or assignment or further assurance, as the
Company or its Affiliates may reasonably request, to evidence, transfer, vest
and confirm the right, title and interest transferred or granted or to be
transferred or granted to the Company or its Affiliates under subsection
13(b) of this Agreement. The Executive shall not contest the validity of any

reduced to practice, and, with respect to all of items (i) through (iv) of
this subsection (d), that (A) results from or is suggested by any work
performed by the Executive for the Company or its Affiliates and relates to
or is within the scope of the business, research or development activities of
the Company or its Affiliates and (B) is made or discovered during the time
of the Executive\'s employment with the Company or its Affiliates, or within

made or discovered during normal working hours, using the assets, facilities
or resources of the Company or its Affiliates, or on the premises of the
Company or its Affiliates. Developments shall include, but not be limited to,
articles, processes, methods, formulas, systems, computer source codes and
techniques as well as improvements thereof and know-how related thereto. All

RIGHTS - THIS AGREEMENT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS TO OWNERSHIP OF  INVENTIONS MADE
BY YOU. YOU MAY HAVE RIGHTS PURSUANT TO STATE LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT
APPLY TO AN INVENTION FOR WHICH NO EQUIPMENT,  SUPPLIES, FACILITIES OR TRADE
SECRET INFORMATION OF THE COMPANY WAS  USED AND WHICH WAS DEVELOPED ENTIRELY
ON YOUR OWN TIME UNLESS (A) THE  INVENTION RELATES (I) TO THE BUSINESS OF THE
COMPANY OR (II) TO THE  COMPANY\'S ACTUAL OR DEMONSTRATABLY ANTICIPATED
RESEARCH OR  DEVELOPMENT, OR (B) THE INVENTION RESULTS FROM WORK PERFORMED BY
YOU  FOR THE COMPANY.   14. EQUITABLE REMEDIES.   The Executive
represents and warrants that Executive has had an opportunity to consult with
Executive\'s attorney regarding this Agreement, has thoroughly and completely
reviewed this Agreement with that attorney, and fully understands the
contents hereof. Furthermore, the Executive acknowledges that (a) a remedy at
law for Executive\'s failure to comply with Sections 7 through 13 of this
Agreement may be inadequate and (b) in the event of the Executive\'s failure
to comply with Sections 7 through 13 of this Agreement, the Company shall be
entitled to seek and obtain from a court having jurisdiction
specific performance, an injunction, a restraining order or any other
equitable relief in order to enforce any such provision.     -9-   The
right to obtain such equitable relief shall be in addition to any
other remedy to which the Company is entitled under applicable law
(including, but not limited to, monetary damages).   15. TERMINATION.  
(a) This Agreement and the Executive\'s employment hereunder
shall automatically terminate upon the death or permanent disability of the
Executive. Permanent disability shall mean that the Executive is unable to
substantially perform Executive\'s duties under this Agreement for a
continuous period of six (6) months or for an aggregate of nine (9) months
during any twelve (12) month period, as determined by a physician selected by
the Company (the "Disability Determination Date") and reasonably satisfactory
to the Executive (or if Executive is unable to act, Executive\'s spouse or
eldest child). The Executive will cooperate in any physical examination
conducted pursuant to this paragraph. The foregoing is subject to the duty of
the Company to provide reasonable accommodation under the Americans with
Disabilities Act. Upon the Executive\'s death, all of Executive\'s (i)
accrued but unpaid base salary and bonus, and (ii) other benefits (but not
including bonus) accrued as of the date of death, shall immediately be
payable to the Executive\'s estate. Upon Executive\'s permanent disability,
the Executive shall receive (i) all accrued but unpaid base salary and bonus
and (ii) other benefits (but not including bonus) accrued as of
the Disability Determination Date.   (b) The Company may, at its sole
option, terminate the Executive\'s employment for cause upon written notice
to the Executive. For purposes of this Agreement, "cause" shall mean (i) a
breach of any of the covenants contained in Sections 7 through 13 of this
Agreement, (ii) a material breach of or substantial failure to perform any
other obligation of the Executive under this Agreement, provided, however,
that if such breach or failure is a curable breach or failure, such breach or
failure was not cured within 30 days after written notice was provided to the
Executive, (iii) the conviction of the Executive for a felony, (iv) a breach
of any policy of the Company provided to the Executive in writing, provided,
however, that if such breach is a curable breach, such breach was not cured
within 10 days after written notice was provided to the Executive, (v)
recklessness or willful misconduct of the Executive in the performance of
Executive\'s duties, (vi) failure to implement IDEX corporate procedures or
directives provided to the Executive in writing, provided, however, that if
such failure is a curable failure, such failure was not cured within 10 days
after written notice was provided to the Executive, as determined by Company
in its reasonable discretion, or (vii) any fraudulent or dishonest act by the
Executive with respect to the Company. In the event that the Executive\'s
employment pursuant to this Agreement is terminated for cause, the Executive
shall receive no salary or other benefits pursuant to this Agreement other
than accrued but unpaid base salary through the date of termination.   (c)
In the event that (i) the Executive\'s employment pursuant to this Agreement
is terminated by the Company other than (A) for cause, or (B) by reason of
expiration of the term     -10-   of this Agreement whether by reason
of delivery of a Non-Renewal Notice or otherwise, or (ii) if the Executive
terminates his employment for good reason, as hereinafter defined, the
Executive will receive all accrued but unpaid base salary and benefits (but
not including bonus) through the date of termination and will continue to
receive payments of base salary pursuant to Section 3(a) of this Agreement
for the period of (X) 18 months if the termination of employment occurs
within 24 months from the date of this Agreement or (Y) 12 months if
the termination of employment occurs after 24 months from the date of
this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "good reason" shall mean (i)
material reduction in the Executive\'s compensation, (ii) material demotion
or reduction in responsibilities or authority from that existing on the date
of this Agreement or the assignment to the Executive of duties or
responsibilities that are substantially inconsistent with his position as
President of the Company, (iii) the Company relocates the Executive\'s
principal office more than 50 miles from its location as of the date of this
Agreement, or (iv) a material breach of or substantial failure to perform any
other obligation of the Company or IDEX under this Agreement if such breach
or failure, if curable, is not cured within 30 days after written notice is
provided to the Company and IDEX. The Executive shall not be required to
mitigate the amount of any payment the Company becomes obligated to make in
connection with this subsection (c), by seeking other employment or
otherwise.   (d) In the event that the Executive\'s employment pursuant to
this Agreement is terminated as a result of the voluntary termination by the
Executive other than for good reason, the Executive shall receive no salary
or other benefits pursuant to this Agreement other than accrued but unpaid
base salary through the date of termination.   (e) In the event that this
Agreement is not renewed and the Executive\'s employment expires at the end
of the term of this Agreement or is terminated by the Company after the term
of this Agreement other than for cause, the Company shall pay to Executive
upon such termination the amount provided for under the Company\'s then
existing severance policy.   16. FAILURE, DELAY OR WAIVER.   No course of
action or failure to act by the Company or the Executive shall constitute a
waiver by such party of any right or remedy under this Agreement, and no
waiver by either party of any right or remedy under this Agreement shall be
effective unless made in writing.     -11-    17. SEVERABILITY.  
Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in
such a manner as to be enforceable under applicable law. However, if any
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed unenforceable under applicable
law by a court having jurisdiction, such provision shall be unenforceable
only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable without invalidating the
remainder thereof or any of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Executive acknowledges and agrees that,
if any part of the covenants contained in Sections 7 through 13 is deemed to
be overbroad or void as against public policy, such invalid portion shall
be severable from such covenants and, upon such event, the Executive requests
that such covenant be reformed ("blue-pencilled") to permit the Company and
the Affiliates to obtain the maximum permissible benefit from such
covenants.   18. NOTICE.   All written communications to a party required
hereunder shall be in writing and (a) delivered in person (to be effective
when so delivered), (b) mailed by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested (to be effective four days after the date it is deposited
in the U.S. Mail), (c) deposited with a reputable overnight courier service

all of the Company\'s business or assets, directly or indirectly, by merger
or consolidation, by purchase of all or substantially all of its assets, or

PLAN  ADDRESS: _________________________  TAXPAYER GRANT: ________ SHARES
OF COMMON STOCK (THE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER: ___________ "RESTRICTED
STOCK")   SIGNATURE: _______________________ GRANT DATE:
_______________________________  Effective on the Grant Date you have been
granted the Restricted Stock, in accordance with the provisions of the IDEX
Corporation Incentive Award Plan (the "Plan") and subject to the
restrictions, terms and conditions set forth herein.  25% of the shares of
Restricted Stock will vest and no longer be subject to the restrictions of
this Agreement on the first anniversary of the Grant Date, and 25% shall vest
and no longer be subject to the restrictions of this Agreement on the date of
each anniversary thereafter, with full vesting on the fourth anniversary of
the Grant Date.  In the event of the termination of your employment or
service for any reason, whether such termination is occasioned by you, by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with or without cause or by mutual
agreement ("Termination of Service"), your right to receive and/or vest in
Restricted Stock under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the
earlier of: (i) the date that you give or are provided with written notice of
Termination of Service, or (ii) if you are an employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, the date that you are no longer actively employed and
physically present on the premises of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
regardless of any notice period or period of pay in lieu of such notice
required under any applicable statute or the common law (each, the "Notice
Period"). For greater clarity, you have no rights to receive and/or vest in
Restricted Stock during the Notice Period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this Award shall be fully vested upon your Termination of Service by reason
of death, Disability, or upon a Change in Control of the Company.  This
award is not transferable except by will or the laws of descent
and distribution.  The Company will cause to be issued one or more stock
certificates, registered in your name, evidencing the Restricted Stock of
your Restricted Stock Award. Each such certificate will bear the following
legend:   The shares of stock represented by this certificate are subject
to  forfeiture and the transferability of this certificate and the shares 
of stock represented hereby are subject to the restrictions, terms and 
conditions (including restrictions against transfer) contained in the  IDEX
Corporation Incentive Award Plan and a Restricted Stock Award  Agreement
dated [the Grant Date], entered into between the registered  owner of such
shares and IDEX Corporation. A copy of the Agreement is  on file
in  RS-4yRatable DRAFT 08-31-2006     the office of the Secretary of
IDEX Corporation, Suite 400, 630 Dundee  Road, Northbrook, Illinois
60062.  Each such certificate, together with stock powers duly executed in
blank related to such Restricted Stock, will be deposited with the Secretary
of the Company or a custodian designated by the Secretary. The Secretary or
custodian will issue a receipt to you evidencing the certificates held that
are registered in your name. Until such certificates have been issued and
registered in your name, you will not be deemed for any purpose to be, or
have rights as, a Company shareholder by virtue of this award. After such
time, you will receive all dividends paid on and will be entitled to vote the
Restricted Stock. Following the vesting of any of your Restricted Stock, the
Company will cause to be issued and delivered to you certificates evidencing
such Restricted Stock, free of the legend provided above.  The Company has
the authority to deduct or withhold, or require you to remit to the Company,
an amount sufficient to satisfy applicable federal, state, local and foreign
taxes arising from this Restricted Stock Award. You may satisfy your tax
obligation, in whole or in part, by either: (i) electing to have the
Company withhold shares of your Restricted Stock otherwise to be delivered
with a fair market value equal to the minimum amount of the tax withholding
obligation; or (ii) surrendering to the Company previously owned Restricted
Stock with a fair market value equal to the minimum amount of the tax
withholding obligation. If you are subject to United Kingdom income tax
and/or national insurance contributions, the Company or any Subsidiary may
withhold or collect any income tax and national insurance contributions: (i)
by deduction from salary or any other payment payable to you at any time on
or after the day an income tax charge arises in respect of a Restricted Stock
Award; (ii) directly from you by payment of cleared funds; or (iii) by
arranging for the sale of some of the shares of Restricted Stock to which you
are entitled.  You acknowledge and consent to the collection, use,
processing and transfer of personal data as described in this paragraph. The
Company, its affiliates and your employer hold certain personal information,
including your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social
security number or other employee tax identification number, salary,
nationality, job title, any shares of stock awarded, cancelled, purchased,
vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the purpose of managing
and administering the Plan ("Data"). The Company and its affiliates will
transfer Data to any third parties assisting the Company in the
implementation, administration and management of the Plan. These recipients
may be located in the European Economic Area, or elsewhere such as the United
States. You authorize them to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the
Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing,
administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any
requisite transfer of such Data as may be required for the administration of
the Plan and/or the subsequent holding of shares of stock on your behalf to a
broker or other third party with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of
stock acquired pursuant to the Plan. You may, at any time, review Data,
require any necessary amendments to it or withdraw the consent herein
in writing by contacting the Company; however, withdrawing the consent may
affect your ability to participate in the Plan.  Your participation in the
Plan is voluntary. The value of the Restricted Stock Award is an
extraordinary item of compensation outside the scope of your employment
contract, if any. As such, the Restricted Stock Award is not part of normal
or expected compensation for purposes of calculating any
severance, resignation, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-
service awards, pensions or retirement benefits or similar payments unless
specifically and otherwise provided. Rather, the awarding of Restricted Stock
under the Plan represents a mere investment opportunity.  RS-4yRatable
DRAFT 08-31-2006    This Restricted Stock Award is granted under and
governed by the terms and conditions of the Plan. You acknowledge and agree
that the Plan is discretionary in nature and may be amended, cancelled, or
terminated by the Company, in its sole discretion, at any time. The grant of
a Restricted Stock Award under the Plan is a one-time benefit and does not
create any contractual or other right to receive an award of Restricted Stock
or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock in the future. Future awards of
Restricted Stock, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company,
including, but not limited to, the timing of the award, the number of shares,
vesting provisions, and the exercise price. The Plan has been introduced
voluntarily by the Company and in accordance with the provisions of the Plan
may be terminated by the Company at any time. By execution of this Agreement,
you consent to the provisions of the Plan and this Agreement. Defined terms
used herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan, unless otherwise
defined herein.  COMPANY:  IDEX

intended to be third party beneficiaries of certain rights under this
Agreement, including, but not limited to, those provided in Section 7 through
14. Therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement, the Company and the Executive agree as
follows:   1. EMPLOYMENT; TERM.   Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees to employ the Executive,
and the Executive hereby accepts such employment, for the period beginning on
the date of this Agreement and continuing for a period of four (4) years (the
"Initial Term") subject to earlier termination of the Executive\'s employment
as provided in this Agreement. Upon the expiration of the Initial Term, the
term of this Agreement shall be renewed automatically for successive
additional one-year periods (each such renewal period being referred to as an
"Extended Term") unless either the Company or the Executive delivers written
notice to the other party that it does not intend to renew this Agreement, at
least 30 days prior to the end of the Initial Term or an Extended Term, as
the case may be (the "Non-Renewal Notice"). In the event that either the
Company or the Executive delivers a Non-Renewal Notice, this Agreement shall
terminate upon the expiration of the then-current Initial Term or Extended
Term, as the case may be. As used herein, the "term" of this Agreement shall
include the Initial Term and each Extended Term, if any.   2. DUTIES.  
(a) The Executive shall serve as the Vice President of the Company
and, subject to the supervision and authority of the Board of Directors,

a corporation and as the President and Board of Directors of the Company
shall from time to time reasonably direct commensurate with the Executive\'s
position. The Company and the Executive agree that, during the term of
Executive\'s employment, the Executive shall serve as Vice President
and Executive will report to the President of the Company. The Executive
agrees to perform Executive\'s duties and discharge Executive\'s
responsibilities in a faithful manner and to the best of Executive\'s ability
and to use all reasonable efforts to promote the interests of the Company and
its Business. The Executive further agrees that, during the term of
Executive\'s employment, Executive will devote substantially all of
Executive\'s skill, knowledge and business time and attention to the
performance of Executive\'s duties under this Agreement; provided however,
that to the extent it does not materially interfere with the Executive\'s
performance of, or ability to perform, any of Executive\'s duties
and obligations under this Agreement, it shall not be a violation of this
Agreement for the Executive to (i) serve on any other corporate, civic or
charitable boards or committees, if and to the extent approved in advance by
the Board of Directors of the Company and (ii) manage personal
investments.   (b) The Executive represents and warrants that Executive is
entering into this Agreement voluntarily and that Executive\'s employment
hereunder and compliance by Executive with the terms of this Agreement will
not conflict with or result in the breach of any agreement to which Executive
is a party or by which Executive is bound.   3. COMPENSATION.   (a)
During the term of the Executive\'s employment under this Agreement,
the Executive shall receive an annual base salary of $170,000, payable in
accordance with the regular payroll practices of the local business unit.
Such annual base salary will be subject to review and possible increase (but
not decrease) by the Company on or about each anniversary of the date of this
Agreement. Any and all increases in the level of the base salary as provided
for in the preceding sentence shall become the level of the base salary for
the remainder of the term until there is a further increase in the base
salary as provided for herein.   (b) During the term of the Executive\'s
employment under this Agreement, the Executive shall be entitled to annual
bonus payments in accordance with IDEX\'s Management Incentive Compensation
Plan applicable to the officers of its subsidiaries, as such Plan is

at targeted levels of operation and would otherwise be based upon the
criteria set forth in the IDEX Management Incentive Compensation Plan. Any
annual bonus for calendar year 2006 will be prorated based on the partial
year between the date of this Agreement and December 31, 2006.    
-3-    (c) As of the effective date of this Agreement, IDEX and Executive
shall enter into a Restricted Stock Award (in the form attached hereto as

long-term incentive awards.   (d) The Company shall deduct or withhold from
all salary payments, and from all other payments made to the Executive
pursuant to this Agreement, all amounts which may be required to be deducted

Executive shall be entitled to any other fringe benefit from time to time
offered to employees of comparable status to the Executive who are employed

RIGHTS - THIS AGREEMENT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS TO OWNERSHIP OF  INVENTIONS MADE
BY YOU. YOU MAY HAVE RIGHTS PURSUANT TO STATE LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT

represents and warrants that Executive has had an opportunity to consult with
Executive\'s attorney regarding this Agreement, has thoroughly and completely
reviewed this Agreement with that attorney, and fully understands the
contents hereof. Furthermore, the Executive acknowledges that (a) a remedy at
law for Executive\'s failure to comply with Sections 7 through 13 of this
Agreement may be inadequate and (b) in the event of the Executive\'s failure
to comply with Sections 7 through 13 of this Agreement, the Company shall be
entitled to seek and obtain from a court having jurisdiction
specific performance, an injunction, a restraining order or any other
equitable relief in order to enforce any such provision.     -9-   The
right to obtain such equitable relief shall be in addition to any
other remedy to which the Company is entitled under applicable law
(including, but not limited to, monetary damages).   15. TERMINATION.  
(a) This Agreement and the Executive\'s employment hereunder
shall automatically terminate upon the death or permanent disability of the
Executive. Permanent disability shall mean that the Executive is unable to
substantially perform Executive\'s duties under this Agreement for a
continuous period of six (6) months or for an aggregate of nine (9) months
during any twelve (12) month period, as determined by a physician selected by
the Company (the "Disability Determination Date") and reasonably satisfactory
to the Executive (or if Executive is unable to act, Executive\'s spouse or
eldest child). The Executive will cooperate in any physical examination
conducted pursuant to this paragraph. The foregoing is subject to the duty of
the Company to provide reasonable accommodation under the Americans with
Disabilities Act. Upon the Executive\'s death, all of Executive\'s (i)
accrued but unpaid base salary and bonus, and (ii) other benefits (but not
including bonus) accrued as of the date of death, shall immediately be
payable to the Executive\'s estate. Upon Executive\'s permanent disability,
the Executive shall receive (i) all accrued but unpaid base salary and bonus
and (ii) other benefits (but not including bonus) accrued as of
the Disability Determination Date.   (b) The Company may, at its sole
option, terminate the Executive\'s employment for cause upon written notice
to the Executive. For purposes of this Agreement, "cause" shall mean (i) a
breach of any of the covenants contained in Sections 7 through 13 of this
Agreement, (ii) a material breach of or substantial failure to perform any
other obligation of the Executive under this Agreement, provided, however,
that if such breach or failure is a curable breach or failure, such breach or
failure was not cured within 30 days after written notice was provided to the
Executive, (iii) the conviction of the Executive for a felony, (iv) a breach
of any policy of the Company provided to the Executive in writing, provided,
however, that if such breach is a curable breach, such breach was not cured
within 10 days after written notice was provided to the Executive, (v)
recklessness or willful misconduct of the Executive in the performance of
Executive\'s duties, (vi) failure to implement IDEX corporate procedures or
directives provided to the Executive in writing, provided, however, that if
such failure is a curable failure, such failure was not cured within 10 days
after written notice was provided to the Executive, as determined by Company
in its reasonable discretion, or (vii) any fraudulent or dishonest act by the
Executive with respect to the Company. In the event that the Executive\'s
employment pursuant to this Agreement is terminated for cause, the Executive
shall receive no salary or other benefits pursuant to this Agreement other
than accrued but unpaid base salary through the date of termination.   (c)
In the event that (i) the Executive\'s employment pursuant to this Agreement
is terminated by the Company other than (A) for cause, or (B) by reason of
expiration of the term     -10-   of this Agreement whether by reason
of delivery of a Non-Renewal Notice or otherwise, or (ii) if the Executive
terminates his employment for good reason, as hereinafter defined, the
Executive will receive all accrued but unpaid base salary and benefits (but
not including bonus) through the date of termination and will continue to
receive payments of base salary pursuant to Section 3(a) of this Agreement
for the period of (X) 18 months if the termination of employment occurs
within 24 months from the date of this Agreement or (Y) 12 months if
the termination of employment occurs after 24 months from the date of
this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "good reason" shall mean (i)
material reduction in the Executive\'s compensation, (ii) material demotion
or reduction in responsibilities or authority from that existing on the date
of this Agreement or the assignment to the Executive of duties or
responsibilities that are substantially inconsistent with his position as
Vice President of the Company, (iii) the Company relocates the Executive\'s
principal office more than 50 miles from its location as of the date of this
Agreement, or (iv) a material breach of or substantial failure to perform any
other obligation of the Company or IDEX under this Agreement if such breach
or failure, if curable, is not cured within 30 days after written notice is
provided to the Company and IDEX. The Executive shall not be required to
mitigate the amount of any payment the Company becomes obligated to make in
connection with this subsection (c), by seeking other employment or
otherwise.   (d) In the event that the Executive\'s employment pursuant to
this Agreement is terminated as a result of the voluntary termination by the
Executive other than for good reason, the Executive shall receive no salary
or other benefits pursuant to this Agreement other than accrued but unpaid
base salary through the date of termination.   (e) In the event that this
Agreement is not renewed and the Executive\'s employment expires at the end
of the term of this Agreement or is terminated by the Company after the term
of this Agreement other than for cause, the Company shall pay to Executive
upon such termination the amount provided for under the Company\'s then
existing severance policy.   16. FAILURE, DELAY OR WAIVER.   No course of
action or failure to act by the Company or the Executive shall constitute a
waiver by such party of any right or remedy under this Agreement, and no
waiver by either party of any right or remedy under this Agreement shall be
effective unless made in writing.    -11-    17. SEVERABILITY.  
Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in
such a manner as to be enforceable under applicable law. However, if any
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed unenforceable under applicable
law by a court having jurisdiction, such provision shall be unenforceable
only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable without invalidating the
remainder thereof or any of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Executive acknowledges and agrees that,
if any part of the covenants contained in Sections 7 through 13 is deemed to
be overbroad or void as against public policy, such invalid portion shall
be severable from such covenants and, upon such event, the Executive requests
that such covenant be reformed ("blue-pencilled") to permit the Company and
the Affiliates to obtain the maximum permissible benefit from such
covenants.   18. NOTICE.   All written communications to a party required
hereunder shall be in writing and (a) delivered in person (to be effective
when so delivered), (b) mailed by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested (to be effective four days after the date it is deposited
in the U.S. Mail), (c) deposited with a reputable overnight courier service

agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent
that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had

all of the Company\'s business or assets, directly or indirectly, by merger

PLAN  ADDRESS: _________________________  TAXPAYER GRANT: ________ SHARES
OF COMMON STOCK (THE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER: ___________ "RESTRICTED
STOCK")   SIGNATURE: _______________________ GRANT DATE:
______________________  Effective on the Grant Date you have been granted
the Restricted Stock, in accordance with the provisions of the IDEX
Corporation Incentive Award Plan (the "Plan") and subject to the
restrictions, terms and conditions set forth herein.  25% of the shares of
Restricted Stock will vest and no longer be subject to the restrictions of
this Agreement on the first anniversary of the Grant Date, and 25% shall vest
and no longer be subject to the restrictions of this Agreement on the date of
each anniversary thereafter, with full vesting on the fourth anniversary of
the Grant Date.  In the event of the termination of your employment or
service for any reason, whether such termination is occasioned by you, by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with or without cause or by mutual
agreement ("Termination of Service"), your right to receive and/or vest in
Restricted Stock under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the
earlier of: (i) the date that you give or are provided with written notice of
Termination of Service, or (ii) if you are an employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, the date that you are no longer actively employed and
physically present on the premises of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
regardless of any notice period or period of pay in lieu of such notice
required under any applicable statute or the common law (each, the "Notice
Period"). For greater clarity, you have no rights to receive and/or vest in
Restricted Stock during the Notice Period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this Award shall be fully vested upon your Termination of Service by reason
of death, Disability, or upon a Change in Control of the Company.  This
award is not transferable except by will or the laws of descent
and distribution.  The Company will cause to be issued one or more stock
certificates, registered in your name, evidencing the Restricted Stock of
your Restricted Stock Award. Each such certificate will bear the following
legend:   The shares of stock represented by this certificate are subject
to  forfeiture and the transferability of this certificate and the shares 
of stock represented hereby are subject to the restrictions, terms and 
conditions (including restrictions against transfer) contained in the  IDEX
Corporation Incentive Award Plan and a Restricted Stock Award  Agreement
dated [the Grant Date], entered into between the registered  owner of such
shares and IDEX Corporation. A copy of the Agreement is  on file
in  RS-4yRatable DRAFT 08-31-2006     the office of the Secretary of
IDEX Corporation, Suite 400, 630 Dundee  Road, Northbrook, Illinois
60062.  Each such certificate, together with stock powers duly executed in
blank related to such Restricted Stock, will be deposited with the Secretary
of the Company or a custodian designated by the Secretary. The Secretary or
custodian will issue a receipt to you evidencing the certificates held that
are registered in your name. Until such certificates have been issued and
registered in your name, you will not be deemed for any purpose to be, or
have rights as, a Company shareholder by virtue of this award. After such
time, you will receive all dividends paid on and will be entitled to vote the
Restricted Stock. Following the vesting of any of your Restricted Stock, the
Company will cause to be issued and delivered to you certificates evidencing
such Restricted Stock, free of the legend provided above.  The Company has
the authority to deduct or withhold, or require you to remit to the Company,
an amount sufficient to satisfy applicable federal, state, local and foreign
taxes arising from this Restricted Stock Award. You may satisfy your tax
obligation, in whole or in part, by either: (i) electing to have the
Company withhold shares of your Restricted Stock otherwise to be delivered
with a fair market value equal to the minimum amount of the tax withholding
obligation; or (ii) surrendering to the Company previously owned Restricted
Stock with a fair market value equal to the minimum amount of the tax
withholding obligation. If you are subject to United Kingdom income tax
and/or national insurance contributions, the Company or any Subsidiary may
withhold or collect any income tax and national insurance contributions: (i)
by deduction from salary or any other payment payable to you at any time on
or after the day an income tax charge arises in respect of a Restricted Stock
Award; (ii) directly from you by payment of cleared funds; or (iii) by
arranging for the sale of some of the shares of Restricted Stock to which you
are entitled.  You acknowledge and consent to the collection, use,
processing and transfer of personal data as described in this paragraph. The
Company, its affiliates and your employer hold certain personal information,
including your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social
security number or other employee tax identification number, salary,
nationality, job title, any shares of stock awarded, cancelled, purchased,
vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the purpose of managing
and administering the Plan ("Data"). The Company and its affiliates will
transfer Data to any third parties assisting the Company in the
implementation, administration and management of the Plan. These recipients
may be located in the European Economic Area, or elsewhere such as the United
States. You authorize them to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the
Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing,
administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any
requisite transfer of such Data as may be required for the administration of
the Plan and/or the subsequent holding of shares of stock on your behalf to a
broker or other third party with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of
stock acquired pursuant to the Plan. You may, at any time, review Data,
require any necessary amendments to it or withdraw the consent herein
in writing by contacting the Company; however, withdrawing the consent may
affect your ability to participate in the Plan.  Your participation in the
Plan is voluntary. The value of the Restricted Stock Award is an
extraordinary item of compensation outside the scope of your employment
contract, if any. As such, the Restricted Stock Award is not part of normal
or expected compensation for purposes of calculating any
severance, resignation, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-
service awards, pensions or retirement benefits or similar payments unless
specifically and otherwise provided. Rather, the awarding of Restricted Stock
under the Plan represents a mere investment opportunity.  RS-4yRatable
DRAFT 08-31-2006    This Restricted Stock Award is granted under and
governed by the terms and conditions of the Plan. You acknowledge and agree
that the Plan is discretionary in nature and may be amended, cancelled, or
terminated by the Company, in its sole discretion, at any time. The grant of
a Restricted Stock Award under the Plan is a one-time benefit and does not
create any contractual or other right to receive an award of Restricted Stock
or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock in the future. Future awards of
Restricted Stock, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company,
including, but not limited to, the tuning of the award, the number of shares,
vesting provisions, and the exercise price. The Plan has been introduced
voluntarily by the Company and in accordance with the provisions of the Plan
may be terminated by the Company at any time. By execution of this Agreement,
you consent to the provisions of the Plan and this Agreement. Defined terms
used herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan, unless otherwise
defined herein.  COMPANY:  IDEX

IDEX CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation with a mailing address of 630 Dundee

Sellers (as defined in the Purchase Agreement (as defined below)) (the

Purchase Agreement dated September ___, 2006 (the "Purchase Agreement")
pursuant to which IDEX has agreed to purchase all of the shares of Banjo
Corporation.   B. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, certain funds are
required to be deposited from time to time with the Escrow Agent to be held
and released by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Purchase Agreement and of this Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows:   1. Definitions.   (a) As
used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the  following
meanings:   (i) "Escrow Account" shall mean Account No. _______________ 
established and maintained at the Escrow Agent\'s principal place of 
business for the purpose of receiving and holding all Escrow Funds in 
accordance with this Agreement.   (ii) "Escrow Deposit" shall mean the
$6,000,000 to be delivered  by IDEX to the Escrow Agent on the date of this
Agreement pursuant to  Section 2 of this Agreement.   (iii) "Escrow Funds"
shall mean the Escrow Deposits and any  Investment Income.   (iv) "Interim
Escrow Release Date" shall mean the business day  following the date the
final Closing Date Balance Sheet adjustment  payments are made pursuant to
Section 1.3(e) of the Purchase  Agreement.   (v) "Investment Income" shall
mean all income which may from time  to time be earned from the investment of
the Escrow Funds.    (vi) "Principals" shall mean IDEX and Sellers\'
Representative.   (b) Each capitalized term which is used in this Agreement
but not  defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning given it in the
Purchase  Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any contrary
provisions of  this Agreement, it is understood that the Escrow Agent is not
a party to  and has neither received nor read, nor does Escrow Agent consent
to, any  provisions of the Purchase Agreement. References in this Agreement
to the  Purchase Agreement are for reference by the Principals and Sellers
only,  and the parties agree that the Escrow Agent shall not be responsible
for  compliance with any provisions of the Purchase Agreement or any
agreement  other than this Agreement.   2. Establishment of Escrow Account.
On the date of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall establish the Escrow
Account to hold the Escrow Funds. On the date of this Agreement, IDEX shall
deliver the initial $6,000,000 Escrow Deposit to the Escrow Agent by wire
transfer. The Escrow Agent shall accept the Escrow Deposit and shall hold and
release the Escrow Funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.   3. Investments. Unless otherwise directed in writing by IDEX
and Sellers\' Representative, the Escrow Funds shall be invested in (a) money
market funds having the highest rating possible from both Standard and Poors
Ratings Group and Moody\'s Investor Services or similar investment options
offered by the Escrow Agent as agreed to by IDEX and Sellers\'
Representative, (b) U.S. Dollar denominated, direct, noncallable, full-faith-
and-credit obligations of the federal government of the United States of
America, (c) certificates of deposit, banker\'s acceptances or time deposits
having maturities of ninety (90) days or less from the date of acquisition
and issued by a United States commercial bank which has unsecured senior debt

paper or securities with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of IDEX
rated at least P-1 by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. and A-1 by Standard and
Poor\'s Corporation (or, with respect to clauses (c) and (d) above, if
neither of such rating agencies is then providing ratings, the
equivalent thereof by another investor service of comparable national
recognition selected by Sellers and reasonably acceptable to IDEX), as
directed by Sellers\' Representative. It is agreed among the parties that the
Escrow Funds will initially be deposited in the Fund identified on the
attached Exhibit E. All Investment Income shall become part of the Escrow
Funds. Sellers\' Representative will provide the Escrow Agent with a W-9 or
W-8 IRS tax form for each Seller on the date of this Agreement. Sellers shall
be liable for all taxes attributable to the Investment Income that is
distributed to them hereunder. Unless prohibited by law, the Escrow Agent
shall report to the IRS all such Investment Income as being taxable to
Sellers. Unless required by law, the Escrow Agent shall not report to the IRS
any Investment Income as being taxable to IDEX, unless such Investment Income
is distributed to IDEX. If the Escrow Agent is required by law to report any
of the Investment Income that has not been distributed to IDEX as being
taxable to IDEX, the Escrow Agent shall be required to distribute Escrow
Funds to IDEX in an amount equal to IDEX\'s tax liability arising from such
Investment Income within thirty (30) days of IDEX notifying the Escrow Agent
of the amount of such tax liability. If the distribution of this tax amount
is considered additional taxable income to IDEX, the Escrow Agent shall be
required to distribute additional Escrow Funds to IDEX as gross up payments
to put IDEX in the same after-tax position as if the distribution of such
tax    -2-    amounts were not taxable income to IDEX. A statement of
citizenship will be provided if requested by the Escrow Agent.   4. Release
of Escrow Funds. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no portion
of the Escrow Funds shall be released unless and until any of the following
conditions shall have occurred:   (a) (i) In the event that IDEX determines
that IDEX is entitled to a  payment pursuant to Section 1.3(e)(ii) of the
Purchase Agreement or  indemnification under Article VI of the Purchase
Agreement against  Sellers, IDEX shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a written
notice  signed by IDEX in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A ("IDEX 
Indemnification Notice") specifically directing that the Escrow Agent 
release from the Escrow Account and deliver to IDEX Escrow Funds in an 
amount equal to the payment claimed pursuant to Section 1.3(e)(ii) of  the
Purchase Agreement or pursuant to the Loss claimed pursuant to  Article VI of
the Purchase Agreement (the "Claimed Loss"). If the  Escrow Agent shall not
have received from Sellers\' Representative,  within thirty (30) days after
the date that the IDEX Indemnification  Notice is received by the Escrow
Agent, a written notice signed by  Sellers\' Representative in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B  ("Sellers\' Indemnification Objection Notice"),
the Escrow Agent shall  release from the Escrow Account and deliver to IDEX
Escrow Funds in an  amount equal to the Claimed Loss. IDEX covenants that an
IDEX  Indemnification Notice shall be given simultaneously to Sellers\' 
Representative and to the Escrow Agent and Sellers\' Representative 
covenants that a Sellers\' Indemnification Objection Notice shall be  given
simultaneously to IDEX and to the Escrow Agent, in each case as  provided for
in Section 10 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything  to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, in the event that a  Sellers\' Indemnification
Objection Notice is delivered to the Escrow  Agent in accordance with this
Agreement, the Escrow Funds shall not be  released by the Escrow Agent except
in accordance with another  subsection of this Section 4 or as provided
elsewhere in this  Agreement.   (ii) If the Escrow Agent shall have
received a Sellers\'  Indemnification Objection Notice from Sellers\'
Representative within  thirty (30) days after the date that the IDEX
Indemnification Notice  is received by the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent
shall continue to  hold the Claimed Loss in the Escrow Account until receipt
of either  (A) joint written instructions from IDEX and Sellers\'
Representative  reasonably satisfactory to Escrow Agent; or (B) a final
order,  judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, provided
the  Escrow Agent received a certified copy of such order, judgment or 
decree, accompanied by an opinion of counsel to the effect that such  order,
judgment or decree represents a final adjudication of the  rights of the
parties by a court of competent jurisdiction and that  the time for appeal
from such order, judgment or decree has expired  without an appeal having
been filed. Any balance of the Claimed Loss  not covered by (A) or (B) shall
be held and/or released by the Escrow  Agent as if such IDEX Indemnification
Notice had never been given.    -3-      (b) On or promptly after the
first day of each calendar quarter, the  Escrow Agent shall release from the
Escrow Account and distribute to  Sellers all Investment Income in the Escrow
Account; provided, however,  that the Escrow Agent shall not so release any
Escrow Funds except to the  extent that after such release there shall be at
least (i) $6,000,000  remaining in the Escrow Account, if such release is
before the release of  Escrow Funds pursuant to Section 4(c) of this
Agreement or (ii) $5,000,000  remaining in the Escrow Account, if such
release is after the release of  Escrow Funds pursuant to Section 4(c) of
this Agreement.   (c) On the Interim Escrow Release Date, or as soon
thereafter as the  Escrow Agent is notified of such date by both IDEX and
Sellers\'  Representative, the Escrow Agent shall release from the Escrow
Account and  distribute to Sellers all Escrow Funds in excess of
$5,000,000.   (d) On April __, 2008, (i) Sellers\' Representative shall
deliver to  the Escrow Agent a written notice signed by Sellers\'
Representative in the  form of Exhibit C ("Sellers\' Distribution Notice")
notifying the Escrow  Agent of the portion of the Escrow Funds which Sellers
believe is subject  to claim by IDEX and requesting delivery of the balance
of the Escrow Funds  (the "Sellers\' Distribution Amount") to Sellers as
described in the  Sellers\' Distribution Notice and (ii) IDEX shall deliver
to the Escrow  Agent a written notice signed by IDEX in the form of Exhibit D
("IDEX  Distribution Notice") notifying the Escrow Agent of the portion of
the  Escrow Funds which IDEX believes are subject to claim by IDEX and 
acknowledging Sellers\' entitlement to the balance of the Escrow Funds (the 
"IDEX Distribution Amount"). Promptly after the later receipt of the 
Sellers\' Distribution Notice or the IDEX Distribution Notice, the Escrow 
Agent shall release from the Escrow Account and deliver to Sellers Escrow 
Funds in an amount equal to the lesser of the Sellers\' Distribution Amount 
and the IDEX Distribution Amount. If the Escrow Agent shall not have 
received from IDEX within thirty (30) days after the date that the Sellers\' 
Distribution Notice is received by the Escrow Agent, an IDEX Distribution 
Notice, then the Escrow Agent shall release from the Escrow Account and 
deliver to Sellers Escrow Funds in an amount equal to the Sellers\' 
Distribution Amount. The parties agree that a Sellers\' Distribution Notice 
must be given simultaneously to IDEX as well as to the Escrow Agent and an 
IDEX Distribution Notice must be given simultaneously to Sellers\' 
Representative as well as the Escrow Agent, in each case as provided in 
Section 10 of this Agreement.   (e) If at any time, a written notice signed
by IDEX and Sellers\'  Representative is delivered to the Escrow Agent
specifically directing  delivery of all or any portion of the Escrow Funds to
IDEX or Sellers, then  the Escrow Agent shall release from the Escrow Account
and deliver to IDEX  or Sellers, as the case may be, the Escrow Funds in
accordance with such  notice.   (f) Unless otherwise directed by written
notice signed by Sellers\'  Representative, all amounts to be distributed to
Sellers pursuant to this  Agreement shall be distributed to a single account
designated by Sellers\'  Representative, and Sellers\' Representative shall
bear all responsibility  for distributing such amount to each Seller in   
-4-     accordance with his, her, or its pre-closing pro rata interest in
Banjo  Corporation as set forth on Exhibit F.   5. Compliance with Court
Orders. If any property subject to this Agreement shall be at any time
attached, garnished or levied upon under any court order or in case the
payment, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property
shall be stayed or enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, writ,
judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court affecting
such property or any part thereof, then in any of such events the Escrow
Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to rely upon and comply with any
such order, writ, judgment or decree which the Escrow Agent is advised by
legal counsel of its own choosing (including internal counsel) is binding;
and if the Escrow Agent complies with any such order, writ, judgment or
decree the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or
to any other person, firm or corporation by reason of such compliance even
though such order, writ, judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed,
modified, annulled, set aside or vacated. The Escrow Agent shall promptly
forward to IDEX and Sellers\' Representative by one of the methods described
in Section 10 copies of all legal documents served on or otherwise received
by the Escrow Agent relating to any of the proceedings described in this
Section 5.   6. Proof of Conditions for Release. The Escrow Agent may refuse
to release any part of the Escrow Funds under Section 4 of this Agreement
unless it has been fully satisfied that each written notice referred to in
Section 4 contains the genuine signature of a Principal or the Principals.
Nothing herein shall require the Escrow Agent to establish the genuineness of
any signature but, instead, the Escrow Agent may in good faith rely upon any
signature appearing to be that of a Principal as being genuine and/or duly
authorized, in the absence of actual knowledge to the contrary.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Escrow Agent
shall act upon receipt of the documents in the forms attached hereto as
Exhibits A through D and shall have no responsibility for verifying any of
the contents thereof.   7. Term. This Agreement shall remain in effect until
one of the following conditions occurs:   (a) The Principals shall have
jointly given 30 days\' advance written  notice of the cancellation of the
designation of the Escrow Agent to act  and serve in such capacity, which
notice shall contain directions to the  Escrow Agent for delivery of the
Escrow Funds;   (b) The Escrow Agent shall have resigned upon 30 days\'
advance written  notice to the Principals;   (c) There shall have been full
compliance with the terms of this  Agreement and the release of all of the
Escrow Funds; or   (d) A court of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a
final order  or judgment ordering the termination of this Agreement, and all
appeals of  such order or judgment shall have been exhausted or all periods
in which to  take an appeal shall have expired without an appeal being
taken.    -5-     In the event that the Escrow Agent resigns pursuant
to subsection (b) of this Section and the Principals fail to agree on a
successor escrow agent within the 30-day notice period, the Escrow Agent
shall deposit the Escrow Funds into the registry of an appropriate court and
request judicial determination of the rights between the Principals, by
interpleader or other appropriate action, and the Principals hereby jointly
and severally agree to indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent harmless from and
against any damages or losses in connection therewith including, but not
limited to attorneys\' fees and court costs at all trial and appellate
levels. Upon termination of the duties of Escrow Agent as set forth in
subsection (a) or (b) of this Section, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the
Escrow Funds to the newly appointed escrow agent designated by the Principals
(or shall otherwise dispose of the Escrow Funds as instructed by
the Principals in writing), and the Escrow Agent shall not otherwise have the
right to withhold the Escrow Funds from the newly appointed escrow agent.  
8. Escrow Agent Fees. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to compensation for
services in accordance with the fee schedule attached hereto as Schedule
A. Without limiting the provisions of Schedule A, Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by it. Such expenses may include the compensation and expenses of the Escrow
Agent\'s counsel, including the allocated costs of internal counsel. Such
expenses shall include the cost of legal review of this Agreement, which fees
shall be billed at the closing of the funding of this Agreement. All such
fees, costs, expenses and attorneys\' fees shall be paid directly from the
Investment Income and, to the extent the Investment Income is insufficient,
shall be borne equally by IDEX and Sellers. If the Escrow Agent\'s fees,
costs, expenses or attorneys\' fees provided for herein are not promptly
paid, Escrow Agent shall have the right to reimbursement from the Escrow
Funds.   9. Liability and Indemnification of Escrow Agent. IDEX and Sellers
hereby agree that the duties of the Escrow Agent are purely ministerial in
nature and shall be expressly limited to the safekeeping of the Escrow Funds
and the disposition of the same in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. IDEX and Sellers hereby agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify
the Escrow Agent and hold it harmless from and against any and all claims,
liabilities, damages, costs, penalties, losses, actions, suits or proceedings
at law or in equity, or any other expenses, fees or charges of any character
or nature, which the Escrow Agent may incur or with which it may be
threatened, directly or indirectly, arising from or in any way connected with
this Agreement or which may result from the Escrow Agent\'s following of
instructions from either or both of the Principals in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, and in connection therewith, to
indemnify the Escrow Agent against any and all expenses, including
attorneys\' fees (including the allocated cost of internal counsel) and the
cost of defending any action, suit or proceeding or resisting any claim,
whether or not litigation is instituted, but nothing herein shall
be construed to so indemnify the Escrow Agent to the extent that it is
determined that the Escrow Agent has acted in a grossly negligent or
intentionally wrongful manner. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable,
directly or indirectly, for any special or consequential damages, even if the
Escrow Agent has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The Escrow
Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to consult with counsel
or other such professionals of choice and shall not be liable for action
taken or omitted to be taken by Escrow Agent in accordance with the advice of
such counsel or other such professionals. The Escrow Agent may in all cases
pay such compensation to such counsel and    -6-    shall be entitled
to reimbursement as set forth in Section 8 for all such compensation paid.
The Escrow Agent may perform its duties through its agents, attorneys,
custodians or nominees. The provisions of this Section shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.   10. Notices. Unless otherwise provided in
this Agreement, any agreement, notice, request, instruction or other
communication to be given hereunder by any party to the other shall be in

exclusive of any other right, power or remedy, but each and every such right,
power or remedy shall be cumulative and concurrent and shall be in addition
to any other right, power or remedy the Escrow Agent may have under this
Agreement or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute, and

construed or considered as a waiver of any other right, power or remedy.

and writings (or any part thereof) whether oral or written between any of the
parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. In the event the
Principals disagree as to their respective rights and obligations under this
Agreement and resolve the disagreement through legal proceedings, the

between the Principals concerning the meaning or validity of any provision
hereunder or concerning any other matter relating to this Agreement, the
Escrow Agent:   (a) shall be under no obligation to act, except under
process or order  of court, or until it has been adequately indemnified and
held harmless to  its full satisfaction, and shall sustain no liability for
its failure to  act pending such process, court order or indemnification;
and   (b) may, in its sole and absolute discretion, interplead that
portion  of Escrow Funds it then holds with any court of competent
jurisdiction, and  name the Principals as parties in such interpleader
action. Upon filing the  interpleader action, the Escrow Agent shall be
relieved of all liability as  to the Escrow Funds and shall be entitled to
recover from the Principals  its reasonable attorneys\' fees and other costs
incurred in commencing and  maintaining such action. In no event shall the
institution of such  interpleader action impair the rights of the Escrow
Agent described  elsewhere in this Agreement.  The Principals further agree

dispute, without making the Escrow Agent a party to same to the extent
possible.   15. Merger or Consolidation. Any corporation or association into

400 Northbrook, IL 60062  Re: Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of
September 8, 2006  Ladies and Gentlemen:  We have acted as counsel to
Banjo Corporation, an Indiana corporation (the "Company"), and its
shareholders (the "Sellers"), in connection with the Stock Purchase
Agreement, dated as of September 8, 2006 (the "Agreement"), among
the Sellers, the Company and you, as Buyer, relating to the purchase by Buyer
of all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of The Company. This opinion
is being delivered to you at the request of Sellers and the Company pursuant
to Section 7.l(i) of the Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein but not
otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to them in the
Agreement.  In connection with this opinion, we have examined the Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement as referred to therein and such corporate records,
certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have
considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon
the basis of such examination, we advise you that, in our opinion:   (1)
The Company is a corporation duly organized and validly existing  under the
laws of the State of Indiana, and has all requisite power and  authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry  on its
business as now being conducted, to execute and deliver the  Agreement, to
perform its obligations thereunder and to consummate the  transactions
contemplated thereby.   (2) The execution and delivery of the Agreement by
the Company, the  performance of the Agreement by the Company and the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated thereby have been duly
authorized by all  necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and
no other  proceeding on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize
the  Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.  
(3) The execution and delivery of the Agreement by the Company do not,  and
the performance of the Agreement by the Company and the consummation of  the
transactions contemplated thereby will not, (a) (i) conflict with or  violate
the articles of incorporation or bylaws, in each case as amended or 
restated, of the Company, (b) conflict with or violate any United States 
federal, state, local or foreign law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, 
order, judgment or decree applicable to the Company or by or to which any  of
its properties or assets is bound or subject or (iii) to our knowledge, 
result     in any breach of, or constitute a default (or an event that
with notice or  lapse of time or both would constitute a default) under, or
give to others  any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or  require payment under, or result in the creation of any
Lien on any of the  Shares pursuant to, any Contract to which the Company is
a party or by  which any of its properties or assets is bound or (b) require
the Company  to obtain any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or
to make any  filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity or, to
our  knowledge, any third party, in each case which has not been obtained
or  made.   (4) The Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company  and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Company, 
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to 
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and 
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors\' 
rights and to general equity principles; provided, however, that we express 
no opinion as to the enforceability of Section 9.12 of the Agreement.   (5)
Each of the Agreement and the Escrow Agreement has been duly  executed and
delivered by each Seller that is a party thereto and  constitutes the valid
and binding obligation of each Seller, enforceable  against such Seller in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,  insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar  laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors\' rights  and to general
equity principles; provided, however, that we express no  opinion as to the
enforceability of Section 9.12 of the Agreement.   (6) The authorized
capital stock of the Company consists of 50,000  shares of Common Stock.
Based solely on the stock transfer records of the  Company, 20,844 shares of
Common Stock are issued and outstanding owned of  record solely by the
Sellers in the respective amounts set forth in Section  2.4(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule. To our knowledge and except as set forth  in Section
2.4(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, no shares of Common Stock are  reserved
for future issuance pursuant to outstanding stock options,  warrants,
convertible securities or other agreements or commitments of any  character
relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other  securities of the
Company.  We also confirm to you that, to our knowledge, except as set forth
in Section 2.14 of the Disclosure Schedule, (i) there is no claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation of any kind, at law or in equity (including
actions or proceedings seeking injunctive relief), by or before any
Governmental Entity pending or, to the knowledge of Sellers, threatened
against the Company or its assets or properties, and (ii) the Company is not
a party or subject to or in default under any judgment, order, decree or
settlement agreement that imposes restrictions on the Company with respect to
its business operations.  With your approval, for purposes of this opinion
we have relied as to certain matters on information obtained from public
officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by us to be
responsible, and we have assumed that each of the Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of each party thereto other than
the Company and  Banjo - Opinion of Seller_s Counsel (September

of Indiana and the laws of the State of New York.  This opinion is
furnished to you solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement and may not, without our prior written consent,
be furnished to or relied upon for any purpose by any other person.  Very
