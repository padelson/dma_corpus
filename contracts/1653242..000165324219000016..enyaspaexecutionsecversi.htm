Recovery from third parties  16.    Where the Purchaser or any member of the Target Group is or is likely to be entitled to recover         from some other person any sum in respect of any matter giving rise to a Claim (not being a claim         under the Tax Covenant which shall be governed by the provisions of Schedule 9), the Purchaser         shall procure that reasonable steps are taken to enforce such recovery and if any sum is so         recovered then either the amount payable by the Seller in respect of that claim shall be reduced         by an amount equal to the sum so recovered (less the Costs of such recovery) or (if the Seller shall         have already made a payment in respect of such Claim) there shall be repaid to the Seller an         amount equal to the amount so recovered (less the Costs) or (if less) the amount of such payment.

The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it shall not be entitled to recover damages or obtain         payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity more than once in respect of the same loss,         shortfall, damage, deficiency, breach or other set of circumstances.    18.    Without prejudice to its rights to recover Costs in respect of the same, the Purchaser shall, and         shall procure that each member of the Target Group shall, take all reasonable steps to avoid or         mitigate any loss or liability which has or may give rise to a Claim other than a Claim under or in         relation to the Tax Covenant.  19.    Any payment by the Seller to the Purchaser under any Claim shall be treated as an adjustment to         the Purchase Price payable by the Purchaser to the Seller for the Shares.   20.    Nothing in this Schedule 5 will have the effect of limiting or restricting any liability of the Seller in         respect of a Claim arising as a result of any fraud or wilful default by the Seller.   21.    The Seller shall not have any liability to the Purchaser for any indirect or consequential loss or         damage arising out of or in connection with any matter or circumstance giving rise to a Claim. </FONT></DIV>
