coverage substantially similar with respect to coverage and amount and to such officers and directors as the D&amp;O Insurance, so long as the aggregate premium therefor would not be in excess of 200% of

jurisdiction of such other federal or state court within the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction over such dispute, (b)&nbsp;agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from the Court of Chancery (or such other court) and (c)&nbsp;agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement, the
Merger, the Closing or the performance of any duties or transactions required hereunder in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware of and for the County of New Castle;

shall, subject to the discretion of such court, reduce the scope, duration, area or applicability of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, void or
