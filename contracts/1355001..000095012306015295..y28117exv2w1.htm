ARTICLE II 

   

DISSENTING SHARES; PAYMENT FOR SHARES; 
 TREATMENT OF EQUITY-BASED AWARDS  

  

 SECTION 2.01. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by stockholders properly exercising and perfecting appraisal rights available under Section 262 of the Corporation Law (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holders shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under the Corporation Law. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the Corporation Law. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal, such holders Shares shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal shall have been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub (a) prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the Corporation Law and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the Corporation Law and (b) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the Corporation Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of capital stock of the Company, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. 

  

 SECTION 2.02. _Payment for Shares_. (a) At or immediately following the Effective Time, Parent will deposit or cause to be deposited with a bank or trust company designated by Parent (and reasonably acceptable to the Company) (the " _Paying Agent_ ") cash in amounts and at times necessary to make the payments due pursuant to _Section 1.06_ to holders of Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amounts being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). As directed by Parent, the Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent in (i) direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for payment of all principal and interest or (iii) commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, or a combination thereof, for the benefit of the Surviving 

   ##### 

  

 

Corporation. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to
fund payments due pursuant to _Section 1.06_ , except as provided in this
Agreement. 

   

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each record holder of a Share, as of the Effective Time which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (other than Excluded Shares), a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Shares to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of a Share and receiving payment therefor. Following surrender to the Paying Agent of such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Share shall be paid in exchange therefor cash in an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax as specified in _Section 1.08_) equal to the product of the number of Shares represented by such letter of transmittal multiplied by the Merger Consideration, and such Shares shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the Shares. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Share surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the letter of transmittal be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Share surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. From and after the Effective Time and until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.02_, each Share shall represent for all purposes solely the right to receive, in accordance with the terms hereof, the Merger Consideration in cash, without any interest thereon. 

   

 (c) At the option of the Surviving Corporation, any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company for one year after the Effective Time shall be repaid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of the Company who have not complied with this  _Section 2.02_ prior to the end of such one-year period shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) but only as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any monies delivered from the Payment Fund or otherwise to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Shares shall not have been surrendered as of a date immediately prior to such time that unclaimed funds would otherwise become subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law, any unclaimed funds payable with respect to such Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 SECTION 2.03. _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Shares shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Article II_, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 2.04. _Treatment of Equity-Based Awards and Deferred Compensation_. (a) The Company shall provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option (including options to purchase Shares issued by the Company in connection with the spin-off of the Company from Cendant Corporation ) to purchase Shares (an " _Option_ ") and each stock appreciation right (a " _SAR_ ") granted under the 2006 Equity and Incentive Plan (the " _Option Plan_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested), except for Options and SARs as to which the treatment in the Merger is hereafter separately agreed by Parent and the holder thereof, which Options and SARs shall be treated as so agreed, shall be cancelled, and the holder thereof shall receive at the Effective Time from the Company, or as soon as practicable thereafter from the Surviving Corporation, in consideration for such cancellation, an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares previously subject to such Option or SAR and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share previously subject to such Option or SAR, less any required withholding Taxes. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit granted under the Option Plan (collectively, the " _RSUs_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for RSUs as to which the treatment in the Merger is hereafter separately agreed by Parent and the holder thereof, which RSUs shall be treated as so agreed, shall cease to represent a right or award with respect to Shares and shall be cancelled and of no further force and effect, and the holder thereof shall receive at the Effective Time, or as soon as practicable thereafter from the Surviving Corporation, in consideration for such cancellation, an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares previously subject to such RSU and (B) the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes. 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, all deferred amounts held in the unit accounts denominated in Shares under the Officer Deferred Compensation Plan and the Non-Employee Directors Deferred Compensation Plan (each, a " _Deferred Unit Account_ "), except for deferred amounts as to which the treatment in the Merger is hereafter separately agreed by Parent and the holder thereof, which deferred amounts shall be treated as so agreed, shall be converted into an obligation to pay cash with a value equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of Shares deemed held in such Deferred Unit Account. Such obligation shall be payable or distributable in accordance with the terms of the agreement, plan or arrangement relating to the Deferred Unit Account, less any required withholding Taxes. 

   

 (d) The Company shall take all action as is necessary to cause the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") to be suspended effective as of a date not later than the end of the calendar month of the date of this Agreement, such that the "offering period" in effect as of the date of this Agreement will be the final offering period under the ESPP, and, as of the Effective Time and subject to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall terminate the ESPP. 

   

 (e) The Board of Directors of the Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall, and such Board of Directors (or committee thereof) shall cause the Company to, take any actions necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.04_, including amending the plans under which such awards or rights are granted; it being understood that the intention of the parties is that following the Effective Time no holder of an 

    ##### 

  

    

Option, SAR, RSU or units in Deferred Unit Accounts or any participant in any
Plan, including the ESPP, or other employee benefit arrangement of the
Company shall have any right thereunder to acquire (or receive
amounts measured by reference to) any capital stock (including any "phantom"
stock or stock appreciation rights) of the Company, any Subsidiary or the
Surviving Corporation. Prior to the Effective Time (and to the extent
requested by Parent, at the time that the amounts provided by this Section
2.04 are paid to the holders of the Options, SARs, RSUs and units in Deferred
Unit Accounts), the Company shall deliver to the holders of the Options,
SARs, RSUs and units in Deferred Unit Accounts appropriate notices, in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, setting forth such holders
rights pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 2.05. _Further Actions_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there shall have been declared, made or paid any dividend or distribution on the Shares or the issued and outstanding Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, redenomination, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this _Section 2.05_;  _provided_ that nothing herein shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited or not expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE III

 SECTION 3.01. _Organization and Qualification_. The Company and each of its Significant Subsidiaries (as such term is defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X) is a duly organized and validly existing corporation or other legal entity in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, with all corporate or similar power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as currently conducted. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation authorized to do business in each of the jurisdictions in which the character of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature of the business transacted by it makes such qualification necessary, except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar governing documents) as currently in effect for the Company and each of its Significant Subsidiaries. Other than the Subsidiaries set forth in _Section 3.01_ of the Disclosure 

   #####

The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, other than, with respect to completion of the Merger, the adoption of the agreement of merger (as such term is used in Section 251 of the Corporation Law) contained in this Agreement by the Requisite Stockholder Vote, prior to the consummation of the Merger. This Agreement has been 

   ##### 

  

 

duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by each of Parent and Merger Sub,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general equity principles.

    ##### 

  

    

Agreement which may be offered by Parent including pursuant to clause (ii)
below, terminate this Agreement and enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal ( _provided_ that and in such event, the
Company substantially concurrently enters into such definitive agreement);
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant
to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless
in advance of or concurrently with such termination the Company pays

(acting through the Special Committee, if then in existence) is considering
another Acquisition Proposal) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
foregoing clause (y) unless (A) the Company shall not have intentionally or
materially breached this _Section 5.02_ and (B): 

    

 (i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least three days in advance (or if prior to the Solicitation Period End-Date, at least two days in advance) (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and other material documents, including the definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "); 

   

 (ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to a Superior Proposal (including, without limitation, any revision in price), the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again comply with the requirements of _Section 5.02(e)(i)_ with respect to such new written notice (except that the period of notice shall be 24 hours), provided that the notice requirement set forth in this sentence shall be suspended during the period prior to the Solicitation Period End-Date with respect to an Exempted Superior Proposal, but only from and after such time as it is deemed to be an Exempted Superior Proposal by the Board of Directors (acting through the Special Committee, if then in existence) in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and financial advisors. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Exempted Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a Superior Proposal that meets both of the following requirements: (x) such proposal is a modification of an initial Acquisition Proposal submitted by any bidder or its affiliates ("Original Proposal") where such initial Acquisition Proposal was deemed to be a Superior Proposal because it included per-Share merger consideration 3.33% or greater than the Merger Consideration (and if the proposed per-Share consideration is not in cash, the Board of Directors (acting 

   ##### 

  

    

through the Special Committee, if then in existence) shall make such
determination in good faith), and such Original Proposal has not been
withdrawn (or the per-Share consideration contained in such Original Proposal
reduced), and (y) such proposal is made, after the latest revised per-Share
merger consideration that may be proposed by Parent following compliance by
the Company with the notice requirements set forth in _Section 5.2(e)(i)_
including with respect to such Original Proposal (the "Revised
Parent Proposal"), and includes per-Share merger consideration more than 2.4%
higher than the Revised Parent Proposal (and if the proposed per-Share
consideration is not in cash, the Board of Directors (acting through the
Special Committee, if then in existence) shall make such determination in
good faith); _provided_ , that promptly upon a determination that a Superior
Proposal is an Excluded Superior Proposal, the Company shall send written
notice to Parent of such determination; and 

   

 (iii) during the period prior to the Solicitation Period End-Date, the Company shall have waited at least 24 hours, from the time of notice to Parent in accordance with the last proviso of _Section 5.02(e)(ii)_ above that an Exempted Superior Proposal exists, before terminating this Agreement in accordance with this Section 5.2(e). 

  

 (f) The Company agrees that, without limiting any of the foregoing, any violations of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.02_ by any of its Representatives that either (i) result in an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) adversely affect the interests of Parent under this  _Section 5.2_ (other than in an immaterial manner) shall be deemed to be a material breach of this Agreement (including this _Section 5.02_) by the Company. 

   

 (g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company from disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

   

 (h) The Company shall not take any action to (i) exempt any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates) from the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the Corporation Law (or any similar provisions of any other Law) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply or (ii) terminate, amend, modify, make any determination under or waive any provision of the Rights Agreement, in each case, unless such actions are taken simultaneously with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(a)_. 

   

 (i) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any offer or proposal, or any indication of interest in making an offer or proposal, made by a Person or group at any time which is structured to permit such Person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of at least 15% of the assets of, equity interest in, or businesses of, the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender offer or exchange offer or similar transaction, including any single or multi-step transaction or series of related transactions, in each case other than the Merger and (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal that is on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the Special Committee, if then in existence) has determined in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel and after taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other 

    ##### 

  

    

aspects of the proposal, including the financing terms thereof) is superior
from a financial point of view to this Agreement (as may be modified by any
revised proposals contemplated hereby); _it_ _being_ _understood_ , that in
the event such other Acquisition Proposal includes per-Share merger
consideration that is exactly equal in value (i.e., not different by $0.01 or
more) (and if the proposed per-Share consideration is not in cash, the Board

business in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (B) in promptly making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain

approvals or waivers. Each of the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
promptly inform the other parties hereto of any oral, and provide copies
of any written, communication with a Governmental Authority regarding any
such filings or information. No party hereto shall independently participate
in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of
any such filings, applications, investigation, or other inquiry
without giving the other parties hereto prior notice of the meeting and, to
the extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Authority, the opportunity
to attend and participate (which, at the request of any of the parties, shall
be limited to outside counsel only).

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than any   ##### 

  

  

  

Governmental Entity) with respect to the Merger, (i) without the prior
written consent of Parent, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being
solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any
liability or other material obligation due to such Person and (ii) except
pursuant to the terms of the Financing Commitments no party hereto shall be
required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent
is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or to
incur any liability or other obligation ( _provided_ , _however_ , that such
party shall give the other parties hereto the opportunity to make such
payments). 

   

 (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates to agree (i) to limit in any material respect or not to exercise any rights of ownership of any securities (including the Shares), or to divest, dispose of or hold separate any securities or all or a portion of their respective businesses, assets or properties or of the business, assets or properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) to limit in any material respect the ability of such entities (A) to conduct their respective businesses or own such assets or properties or to conduct the businesses or own the properties or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (B) to control their respective businesses or operations or the businesses or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations of this _Section 5.06_ shall not apply to each of the Parent and Merger Sub if compliance with this _Section 5.06_ would result in, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 SECTION 5.07. _Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers and employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or the articles of organization, bylaws or similar constituent documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date of this Agreement with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time unless otherwise required by Law. In addition to and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each Indemnified Person against any costs or expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (with the prior written consent of Parent) in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before the Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such Persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company), except for in any case, any claim, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts to be paid which relate to any act or omission which constitutes a material violation of Law and except for other exceptions to indemnification that are required by Law. In the event of any such Action, the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Person in the defense of any such Action. The Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume control of and the defense of, any Action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation to 

   ##### 

  

 

which this  _Section 5.07(a)_ shall apply; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of applicable Indemnified
Persons) for all Indemnified Persons in any jurisdiction with respect to any
single Action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, unless the use
of one counsel for such Indemnified Persons would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest that would make such joint representation inappropriate.
The Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section
5.07(a)_ The advancement of any amounts to be paid in respect of legal and
other fees and expenses pursuant to this _Section 5.07(a)_ shall be subject
to an undertaking of the recipient to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification from the
Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain director and officer liability policies from a reputable and financially sound carrier through and including the date six years after the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective Time and such policies shall contain coverage that is at least as favorable to the Persons covered by such existing policies (a complete and accurate copy of which has been made available to Parent) _provided_ that the Company may, in consultation with Parent, substitute therefor a single premium tail coverage with respect to such directors and officers liability insurance with policy limits, terms and conditions at least as favorable as the limits, terms and conditions in the existing policies of the Company (or with such other limits, terms and conditions as permitted by the final two provisos of this sentence); _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall Parent be required, or the Company be permitted, to expend an amount pursuant to this _Section 5.07(b)_ in excess of 250% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for its existing coverage in the aggregate (the " _Insurance Amount_ "); and _provided, further_ , that if the Company is unable to obtain tail coverage with policy limits, terms and conditions at least as favorable to the limits, terms and conditions in the existing policies of the Company as a result of the preceding provision, the Company or Parent shall obtain the most advantageous tail coverage as is available for the Insurance Amount. 

   

 (c) This _Section 5.07_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Person (notwithstanding that such Persons are not parties to this Agreement) and their respective heirs and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Person on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section 5.07_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

   

 (e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)   ##### 

  

  

  

transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section
5.07_. 

   

 (f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.07_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under any such policies, _provided_ that, for avoidance of doubt, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to make any payments thereunder or in connection therewith. 

   

 SECTION 5.08. _Employee Matters_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, except as set forth below, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and from and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor, in accordance with their terms, all Plans. 

  

 (b) Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time (except as provided in clause (ii) of this sentence), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries to, provide the individuals employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (the " _Current Employees_ ") with compensation (which shall include, for each such Current Employee, (i) base salary at least equal to that in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) with respect to fiscal year 2007, a target percentage for purposes of annual cash incentive bonus opportunity at least equal to that in effect with respect to the fiscal year 2006) and benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits provided to Current Employees as a group immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding equity-based benefits and compensation); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to Current Employees who have entered into or will enter into an individual employment agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, (i) __ nothing contained herein shall be or be deemed to constitute an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits plans maintained for or provided to Current Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) nothing herein or in _Section 5.08(a)_ shall prevent the amendment or termination of any Plan or interfere with the Surviving Corporations right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to conform with applicable Law (including Section 409A of the Code). Nothing in this _Section 5.08_ shall limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Current Employee at any time. 

   

 (c) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to cause service rendered by Current Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account for vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for accrual purposes, except for vacation and severance, if applicable) under employee benefit plans of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to the same extent as such service was taken into account under the corresponding Plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries for those purposes. Current Employees will not be subject to any pre-existing condition limitation under any health plan of   ##### 

  

  

  

the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries for any condition for which
they would have been entitled to coverage under the corresponding Plan of
the Company or its Subsidiaries in which they participated prior to the
Effective Time. Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, to give such Current Employees credit under such plans for co-
payments made and deductibles satisfied prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding the general provisions of _Section 5.08(b)_, until at least December 31, 2007, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each Current Employee (other than Current Employees who have entered into or will enter into an individual employment agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) with severance benefits that are no less favorable than those that would have been provided to such Current Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (e) The parties hereby agree to take all actions necessary to effectuate the provisions set forth on _Section 5.08(e)_ of the Disclosure Letter. 

   

 (f) No later than three Business Days prior to its distribution, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall provide Parent and Merger Sub with a copy of any communication intended to be made to any of their respective employees relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and will provide an opportunity for Parent and Merger Sub to make reasonable revisions thereto. 

   

 (g) This _Section 5.08_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 5.08_, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 5.08_. 

   

 SECTION 5.09. _Takeover Laws_. The Company shall take all reasonable steps to exclude the applicability of, or to assist in any challenge to the validity or applicability to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement of, any Takeover Laws. 

  

 SECTION 5.10. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, which is likely to result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VI;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.10_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any of the parties receiving such notice. 

  

 SECTION 5.11. _Financing_. (a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to, provide to Parent and Merger Sub all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the Debt Financing and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) participation in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies, (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the Debt Financing, including execution and 

   #####

and substance to the Company in connection with bank information memoranda,
(iii) as promptly as practical, furnishing Parent and its Debt
Financing sources with financial and other information regarding the Company
and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including all
financial statements, pro forma financial information, financial data, audit
reports and other information of the type required by Regulation S-X and
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and of type and form customarily
included in a registration statement on Form S-1 (or any applicable successor
form) under the Securities Act for a public offering to consummate the
offering(s) of debt securities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter,
assuming that such offering(s) were consummated at the same time during
the Companys fiscal year as the offering(s) of debt securities contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter, or as otherwise required in connection with
the Debt Financing and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (all
such information in this clause (iii), the " _Required Information_ "), (iv)
using reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters,
legal opinions, appraisals, surveys, engineering reports, title insurance and
other documentation and items relating to the Debt Financing as reasonably
requested by Parent and, if requested by Parent or Merger Sub, to reasonably
cooperate with and assist Parent or Merger Sub in obtaining
such documentation and items, (v) using its reasonable best efforts to
provide monthly financial statements (excluding footnotes) within 30 days of

efforts to execute and deliver any pledge and security documents, other
definitive financing documents, or other certificates, or documents as may be
reasonably requested by Parent (including a certificate of the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to solvency
matters) and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral
(including cooperation in connection with the pay off of existing indebtedness
and the release of related Liens, if any), _provided_ that no obligation of
the Company or any Subsidiary under such executed documents shall be
effective until the Effective Time, (vii) taking all actions necessary to (A)
permit the prospective lenders involved in the Financing to evaluate the
Companys current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and
procedures relating thereto for the purposes of establishing collateral
arrangements and (B) establish bank and other accounts in connection with the
foregoing and (viii) using reasonable best efforts to obtain waivers,
consents, estoppels and approvals from other parties to material
leases, encumbrances and contracts to which any Subsidiary of the Company is
a party and to arrange discussions among Parent, Merger Sub and their
financing sources with other parties to material leases, encumbrances and
contracts. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and
its Subsidiaries logos as may be reasonably necessary in connection with the
Debt Financing;  _provided_ , that such logos are used solely in a manner
that is not intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and its or their marks. Nothing in this
_Section 5.11(a)_ shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
provide any assistance to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with
the ongoing business or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.11(a)_ to the contrary, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
commitment fee or similar fee or incur any liability with respect to the Debt
Financing prior to the Effective Time. Upon the valid termination of this
Agreement (other than in accordance with _Section 7.01(f))_, Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, officers, 

   ##### 

  

    

employees, representatives and advisors in connection with their respective
obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.11(a)_. Parent and Merger Sub hereby
agree and acknowledge that Financing and the Debt Tender Offer do not
constitute conditions to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, representatives and advisors
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the Debt Financing and
any information utilized in connection therewith, except to the extent that
such losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses, directly or indirectly,
resulted from or arose out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments ( _provided_  that Parent and Merger Sub may replace or amend the Debt Financing Commitments to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement, or otherwise so long as the terms are not less favorable to Merger Sub, with respect to conditionality or amount, than those in the Debt Financing Commitments as in effect on the date of this Agreement), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitments, negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein (including the flex provisions) or on other terms acceptable to the Parent and not materially less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub and not in violation of this _Section 5.11_, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent in such definitive agreements that are within its control, (iii) consummate the Debt Financing on the Closing Date substantially concurrently with the Effective Time and (iv) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters.
