 (A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the aggregate number of No Election Shares, then (x) all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration and (y) the No Election Shares of each stockholder of the Company shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration in respect of that number of No Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of No Election Shares of such stockholder by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of No Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holder\'s No Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; or 

  

 (B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate number of No Election Shares, then (x) all No Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration and (y) the number of Stock Election Shares of each stockholder of the Company that shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Stock Election Shares of such stockholder by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate number of No Election Shares, and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holder\'s Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration. 

     

 (e) If either the opinion of DLA Piper LLP referred to in _Section 6.3(e)_ or the opinion of Paul Hastings LLP referred to in _Section 6.2(f)_ cannot be rendered (as reasonably determined by such counsel) as a result of the Merger potentially failing to satisfy continuity of interest requirements under applicable federal income tax principles relating to reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the Code, then the Cash Election Shares shall be decreased and the Stock 

  

      

  

Election Shares increased to the minimum extent necessary to enable the
relevant tax opinion or opinions, as the case may be, to be rendered.

  

 (f) From and after the Effective Time, the Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ shall no longer remain outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate previously representing any such Company Common Stock or shares of Company Common Stock that are in non-certificated book-entry form shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities, except the right to receive: (i) the consideration to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to this _Section 2.6;_ (ii) any dividends and other distributions in accordance with _Section 2.8(c);_ and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with _Section 2.8(d)_. 

  

 (g) If at any time during the period between the Agreement Date and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding common stock of Parent or the outstanding common stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange, merger, consolidation or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, or any similar transaction or event, the Exchange Ratio, the Per Share Stock Consideration, the Per Share Cash Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

  

  

 2.7 _ Election Procedures._ 

  

  

 (a) Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement pursuant to _Section 5.3(a)_, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent hereunder (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") and shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "). 

  

 (b) Each person who, on or prior to the Election Date, is a record holder of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to specify the number of such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock (and, if such shares to which the election relates are represented by Certificates, such particular shares) with respect to which such holder makes a Cash Election or Stock Election. 

  

 (c) Parent shall prepare and file as an exhibit to the Registration Statement a form of election (the " _Form of Election_ ") in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Form of Election shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Form of Election and any Certificates. The Company shall mail the Form of Election with the Proxy Statement to all persons who are record holders of shares of Company Common Stock as of the record date for the Company Stockholders\' Meeting. The Form of Election shall be used by each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock (or, in the case of nominee record holders, the Beneficial Owner through proper instructions and documentation) who wishes to make a Cash Election or a Stock Election or a combination of both for any and all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make the Form of Election available to all persons who become holders of shares of Company Common Stock during the period between the record date for the Company Stockholders\' Meeting and the Election Date. 

   

 (d) Any holder\'s election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have received at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on or prior to (1) the date of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting or (2) if the Closing Date is more than four (4) Business 

  

      

  

Days following the Company Stockholders\' Meeting, two (2) Business Days
preceding the Closing Date, or (3) such other date as the parties mutually
agree (the " _Election Date_ "), a Form of Election properly completed and
signed and accompanied by (i) Certificates representing the shares of Company
Common Stock to which such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank
or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company (or
by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Parent as set forth in such
Form of Election from a firm that is an "eligible guarantor institution" (as
defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act); provided that such
Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time set
forth in such guarantee of delivery) or (ii) in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
any additional documents required by the procedures set forth in the Form of
Election. After a Cash Election or a Stock Election is validly made with
respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, no further registration of
transfers of such shares shall be made on the stock transfer books of the
Company, unless and until such Cash Election or Stock Election is properly
revoked in accordance with _Section 2.7(f)_.

  

 (e) Parent and the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated Election Date at least five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Date shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent and the Company shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled Election Date. 

  

 (f) Any Cash Election or Stock Election may be revoked with respect to all or a portion of the shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto by the holder who submitted the applicable Form of Election by appropriate written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Election Date. In addition, all Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall automatically be revoked if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article VII_. If a Cash Election or Stock Election is revoked with respect to shares of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates, Certificates representing such shares shall be promptly returned to the holder that submitted the same to the Exchange Agent. 

  

 (g) The determination of the Exchange Agent (or the joint determination of Parent and the Company, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make any such determination) shall be conclusive and binding as to whether or not Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall have been properly made or revoked pursuant to this _Section 2.7_ and as to when Cash Elections, Stock Elections and revocations were received by the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent (or Parent and the Company jointly, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make the following computation) shall also make all computations as to the proration contemplated by _Section 2.6(d)_, and absent manifest error this computation shall be conclusive and binding. The Exchange Agent may, with the written agreement of Parent and the Company, make any rules as are consistent with this _Section 2.7_ for the implementation of the Cash Elections and Stock Elections provided for in this Agreement as shall be necessary or desirable to effect these Cash Elections and Stock Elections. 

  

  

 2.8 _ Exchange of Certificates._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Deposit of Merger Consideration._ 

    

 (i) Within one (1) Business Day following the Effective Time, and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company, (A) certificates or, at Parent\'s option, evidence of shares in book entry form, representing shares of Parent Common Stock in denominations as the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify and (B) cash, in each case as are issuable or payable, respectively, pursuant to this _Article II_ in respect of shares of Company Common Stock for which Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been properly delivered to the Exchange Agent or the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares. Such certificates (or evidence of book-entry form, as the case 

   

      

   

may be) for shares of Parent Common Stock and such cash so deposited,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, are
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ".

   

 (ii) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash deposited with the Exchange Agent by Parent as directed by Parent, provided that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Per Share Cash Consideration payable to holders of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration or cash in lieu of fractional interests, and Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration in the amount of any such losses. Any interest or income produced by such investments shall not be deemed part of the Exchange Fund and shall be payable to Parent. 

    

 (b) _ Exchange Procedures._ 

    

 (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of No Election Shares (such holders, " _Non-Electing Holders_ "): (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such holder representing such No Election Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. Such letter of transmittal shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may specify and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. 

  

 (ii) (x) Each former stockholder of the Company who properly made and did not revoke a Cash Election or Stock Election shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such stockholder\'s Election Shares the following as specified in clauses (A) and (B); and (y) upon surrender by a Non-Electing Holder to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, each Non-Electing Holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor: (A) the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, into which such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder\'s properly surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, were converted in accordance with this _Article II_ (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock to which an election or non-election of the same type were made), and such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled, and (B) a check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) equal to (I) the amount of cash (including the Per Share Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional interests in shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.8(d)_), if any, into which such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder\'s properly surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, were converted in accordance with this _Article II_, plus (II) any cash dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.8(c)_. 

   

    

   

   

                                     

   

   

 (iii) If payment or issuance of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment or issuance that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment or issuance shall have paid to the Exchange Agent any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holder\'s compliance with the replacement requirements established by the Exchange Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by the Certificate pursuant to this _Article II_. 

   

 (iv) No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_, the issuance or payment of which (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares) shall be deemed to be the satisfaction in full of all rights pertaining to shares of Company Common Stock converted in the Merger. 

   

 (v) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Company or Parent for transfer shall be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article II_. 

    

 (c) _ Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares._ No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares until those Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in this _Article II_. Upon surrender, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of surrender, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to those shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date on or after the date of the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of this surrender and not previously paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to those shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date on or after the date of the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender. 

  

 (d) _ No Fractional Shares._ No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing Company Common Stock, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu thereof, upon surrender of the applicable Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, Parent shall pay each holder of Company Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the Effective Time and for which an election or non-election of the same type was made by such holder and rounding down to the nearest one thousandth) would otherwise be 

  

      

  

entitled, by (b) the closing price on Nasdaq for a share of Parent Common
Stock on the last trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time.

   

 (e) _ Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the stockholders of the Company on the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand by Parent, and any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law) for payment of their claim for any part of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock, without any interest thereon. 

  

 (f) _ No Liability._ None of Parent, the Company or Merger Sub shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock for cash or shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (g) _ Withholding._ Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock (or with respect to all amounts payable pursuant to _Section 2.6_) pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any other provision of applicable federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock (or to the recipient of any amount payable pursuant to _Section 2.6_) in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent. 

  

  

 2.9 _ Company Equity Awards._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Company Options._ Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor Merger LLC shall assume any Company Options in connection with the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of immediately prior to and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of any optionholder, all Company Options outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest and become exercisable. To the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, then upon the Effective Time each Company Option shall be canceled, and in exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation shall, promptly following the Effective Time, pay to each former holder of any such Company Option an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Taxes), equal to the product of: (i) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Cash Consideration over the exercise price of each such Company Option and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Option; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the exercise price per share of any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Cash Consideration, such Company Option shall be canceled and terminated without any cash payment being made or other consideration being offered in respect thereof. 

   

 (b) _ Company RSUs._ Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall assume any Company restricted stock units issued pursuant to the Company Option Plans (the " _Company RSUs_ ") in connection with the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of immediately prior to and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of any holder of any Company RSU, each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested, shall become fully vested immediately prior to, and then shall be canceled at, the Effective Time (the " _Canceled RSU_ "), and, in exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation shall, promptly following the Effective Time, pay to each 

  

      

  

former holder of any such Canceled RSU an amount in cash (without interest,
and subject to deduction for any required withholding Taxes) equal to the
product of (i) the Per Share Cash Consideration and (ii) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Canceled RSUs.

  

 (c) The Company shall take such actions as are necessary to approve and effectuate the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.9_, including making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof or any administrator of a Company Option Plan as may be necessary. 

  

 (d) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Company\'s 2006 Stock Incentive Plan. All remaining unissued shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Company\'s 2006 Stock Incentive Plan shall be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock by multiplying the number of such shares by the Exchange Ratio set forth in _Section 2.6(c)(i)_. 

  

  

 2.10 _ Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock as to which the holder thereof shall be entitled to demand appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and shall have properly demanded appraisal in compliance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (each, a " _Dissenting Share_ "), if any, such holder shall be entitled to payment, solely from the Surviving Corporation, of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares to the extent permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) if any holder of Dissenting Shares, under the circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL, affirmatively withdraws his demand for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, or (b) if any holder of Dissenting Shares takes or fails to take any action the consequence of which is that such holder is not entitled to payment for his shares under the DGCL, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock and such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Dissenting Shares and if such withdrawal or forfeiture shall occur following the Election Date, 50% of such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and all other such shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, in each case, without interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect thereto. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. 

   

 2.11 _ Further Assurances._ If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Parent and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Parent, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

 5.2 _ No Solicitation._ 

  

  

 (a) Subject to _Section 5.2(b)_, until the earlier of the Effective Time and the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_, the Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly through another Person, except as otherwise provided below: (i) solicit, initiate, or take any action outside the ordinary course of business to encourage, facilitate, or induce, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, the making, submission or announcement of, any proposal or inquiry that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) other than informing Persons of the provisions contained in this _Section 5.2_, enter into, continue or participate in any discussions or any negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or otherwise take any action outside the ordinary course of business to encourage, facilitate, or induce any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) furnish any non-public information regarding the Company to any Person in connection with or in response to or which would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iv) approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or other Contract contemplating an Acquisition Proposal or requiring the Company to abandon or terminate its obligations under this Agreement; or (v) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Any action by a Subsidiary or Representative of the Company that 

  

      

  

would, if taken by the Company, be a violation of the restrictions of this
_Section 5.2_ shall be deemed a breach of this _Section 5.2_ by the
Company. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.2_ to the contrary, at any time prior to the time the Required Stockholder Vote is obtained, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that is presented to the Company (and not withdrawn) that the Company Board determines in good faith constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor (who shall be either Covert and Co. or a nationally recognized financial advisor)), the Company may, upon a good faith determination by the Company Board (after receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Board\'s fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under applicable Law: (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and such Person\'s Representatives); and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal (the taking of any action addressed in (A) or (B), a " _Superior Proposal Response_ "), _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to a Superior Proposal Response (x) the Company and such Person enter into a confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement (including, without limitation, any "standstill" and non-solicitation provisions, in each case, no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement) and provide a copy to Parent thereof; and (y) such information shall have been provided to Parent in writing. 

  

 (c) The Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing, in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal of the Company\'s intention to participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish non-public information to, such Person, and shall, in any such notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions of any proposal or offer or the nature of any inquiries or contacts, and thereafter, shall promptly keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of all material developments affecting the status and the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, including the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and any material changes thereto and of the status of any such discussions or negotiations. 

  

 (d) The Company Board shall not: (i) fail to make the Company Board Recommendation to the Company\'s stockholders; (ii) withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation; (iii) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable the adoption of any Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such actions (each such foregoing action or failure to act in clauses (i) through (iv) being referred to as a " _Change in Company Board Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board may, at any time prior to the time the Required Stockholder Vote is obtained, take any of the actions set forth in _Sections 5.2(d)(i)-(iii)_ below; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to taking any such action, the Company complies with _Section 5.2(e)_ of this Agreement. 

    

 (i) effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation in response to an Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under applicable Law and the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company\'s financial advisor (who shall be either Covert and Co. or a nationally recognized financial advisor), that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; 

   

      

   

 (ii) effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under applicable Law; 

  

 (iii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ and enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement, but only if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company\'s financial advisor, constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to enter into such definitive agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under applicable Law. 

    

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.2(d)_, the Company shall not be entitled to: (i) make a Change in Company Board Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.2(d)(i)_ or _Section 5.2(d)(ii)_; or (ii) terminate this Agreement and enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.2(d)(iii)_, unless: (A) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent that it intends to (x) make a Change in Company Board Recommendation (a " _Recommendation Change Notice_ "), or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ in response to a Superior Proposal (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ "), which notice shall, if the basis for the proposed action by the Company Board is an Intervening Event, contain a description of the events, facts and circumstances giving rise to such proposed action or, if the basis for the proposed action by the Company Board is a Superior Proposal, contain a description of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, including a copy of the Company Acquisition Agreement in the form to be entered into (it being understood and agreed that the delivery of such notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a Change in Company Board Recommendation); and (B) Parent does not make, within five (5) days after the receipt of such notice, a proposal that would, in the good-faith judgment of the Company Board (after (a) negotiating in good faith with Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement and (b) consultation with outside counsel and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, the Company\'s financial advisor, who shall be either Covert and Co. or a nationally recognized financial advisor), cause such events, facts and circumstances to no longer form the basis for the Company Board to effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation or cause the offer previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, as the case may be. Any material changes with respect to such events, facts or circumstances mentioned above, or material changes to the financial terms of such Superior Proposal, as the case may be, occurring prior to the Company\'s effecting a Change in Company Board Recommendation or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ shall require the Company to provide to Parent a new Recommendation Change Notice or Superior Proposal Notice and a new five (5) day period. 

  

 (f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company\'s stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders if, in the good-faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 5.2(f)_ shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board to effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation, except to the extent permitted by _Section 5.2(e)_. 

  

       

 5.3 _ Preparation of SEC Documents; Stockholders\' Meetings._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Registration Statement and Prospectus._ 

    

 (i) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, and in any event within thirty (30) days following the Agreement Date, the Company and Parent shall prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC, the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be included. Each of Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information concerning it as may reasonably be requested by the other party in connection with such actions and the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement, which provision of information shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the other party pursuant to this _Section 5.3_. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. 

  

 (ii) (A) All filings by the Company with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (B) all mailings to the stockholders of the Company in connection with the Merger and transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the prior review by Parent. All filings by Parent with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Registration Statement, shall be subject to the prior review by the Company. 

  

 (iii) Each of Parent and the Company shall (A) as promptly as practicable notify the other of (x) the receipt of any comments from the SEC and all other written correspondence and oral communications with the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement (including the time when the Registration Statement becomes effective and the issuance of any stop order or suspension of qualifications of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction) and (y) any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or for additional information with respect thereto and (B) supply each other with copies of (1) all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or the Merger and (2) all orders of the SEC relating to the Registration Statement. 

  

 (iv) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or Merger LLC, which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement, so that neither of such documents would include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties in writing and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. 

   

      

  

 (b) The Company shall duly give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders\' Meeting as promptly as practicable following the date the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act (on a date selected by the Company in consultation with Parent) and shall, subject to _Section 5.2(d)_, recommend to its stockholders adoption of this Agreement and include in the Proxy Statement such recommendation. The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited by the Company in connection with the Company Stockholders\' Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Laws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders\' Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to its stockholders in advance of a vote on the adoption of this Agreement, or if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders\' Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to _Section 5.2(d)_, the Company\'s obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 5.3(b)_ shall not be affected by (i) the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Alternative Transaction Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof of such Board of Directors\' or such committee\'s approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger. 

  

  

 5.4 _ Access to Information._ Upon reasonable prior notice and subject to applicable Law, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees and Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and its officers, directors, employees and Representatives, following notice from Parent to the Company in accordance with this _Section 5.4_, reasonable access during normal business hours to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities, books and records and contracts of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and all other financial, operating and other data and information as Parent may reasonably request and, during such period shall furnish, and shall cause to be furnished, as promptly as reasonably practicable, to Parent, a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the requirements of the federal securities laws or a Governmental Body, except, with respect to examination reports, as may be restricted by applicable Law. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall confer on a regular basis with one or more representatives of Parent to report material operational matters and the general status of ongoing operations and shall promptly provide Parent with (A) all material operating and financial reports prepared by the Company and its Subsidiaries for the Company\'s management, including copies of the unaudited monthly consolidated financial statements, and (B) any other written reports or other written materials reasonably requested by Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to disclose any information that, in its sole and absolute discretion after consultation with outside legal counsel, (i) it is not legally permitted to disclose or the disclosure of which would contravene any applicable Law or order or (ii) the disclosure of which would be reasonably likely to cause the loss of any material attorney-client or other legal privilege with respect to such information or which would constitute a waiver of any other privilege or trade secret protection held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company shall be entitled to have Representatives present at all times during any such inspection. No investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ or information provided, made available or delivered to Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ or otherwise shall affect any representations or warranties of the Company or conditions or rights of Parent contained in this Agreement. 

        

 5.5 _ Commercially Reasonable Efforts._ 

  

  

 (a) No later than ten (10) Business Days after the Agreement Date, each party shall make or cause to be made, in cooperation with the other parties, an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Merger. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) respond at the earliest practicable date to any requests for additional information made by the U.S. Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission, (" _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Body under any Antitrust Law relating to the Merger or to any other transaction contemplated hereby; (ii) act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other party in connection with any investigation of the Merger or of any of the transactions contemplated hereby by any Governmental Body under any Antitrust Law; (iii) to the extent permitted by Law, furnish to each other all information required for any filing, form, declaration, notification, registration and notice relating to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law; and (iv) take all other actions reasonably necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law with respect to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby. In connection with the foregoing: (A) whenever possible, each party shall give the other party reasonable prior notice of any written or oral communication with, and any proposed understanding or agreement with, any Governmental Body regarding any filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations or notices, and permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed written or oral communication, understanding or agreement with any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby; (B) to the extent reasonably practical, none of the parties hereto shall participate in any meeting or conversation with any Governmental Body in respect of any filings or inquiry under any Antitrust Law relating to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Body, permitting the other party to attend and participate; (C) if one party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Body from participating in or attending a meeting, conference or conversation, the attending party shall keep the other reasonably apprised with respect thereto; and (D) the parties hereto shall consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any information or proposals submitted to a Governmental Body in connection with proceedings under any Antitrust Law relating to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts: (1) to avoid the entry of any Restraint under any Antitrust Law (an " _Antitrust Restraint_ "); and (2) to eliminate every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Body so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event, not later than the Outside Date). 

  

 (b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from all Governmental Bodies and other Persons and make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with all Governmental Bodies, that are necessary to consummate the Merger. 

  

      

                                    

   

  

 (c) Notwithstanding this _Section 5.5_, nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Parent, or any of its Subsidiaries, to propose, negotiate, offer to commit to effect, or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or disposition of any assets or businesses of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or otherwise to offer to take, to offer to commit to take, or to take, any action (including any action that limits Parent\'s freedom of action, ownership or control with respect to, or its ability to retain, hold, or operate, any of the businesses, assets, product lines, properties or services of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates), even if such action would avoid the entry of an Antitrust Restraint or eliminate an impediment to the Closing that may be asserted by any Governmental Body under any Antitrust Law. 

  

  

 5.6 _ Public Announcements._ The initial press release with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Except as permitted in accordance with _Section 5.2_, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and, to the extent practicable, give each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the Merger and consider in good faith the views of the other party, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation and receiving the written consent of the other to issue such press release or make such public statement, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange or trading market on which securities of Parent or the Company are listed, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use reasonable best efforts to allow the other party or parties hereto reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance (it being understood that the final form and content of any such release or announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or announcement, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party). Without limiting the reach of the foregoing, provided that the Company has not provided Parent with any notice pursuant to _Section 5.2(c)_, Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate to develop all public announcement materials and make appropriate management available at presentations related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as reasonably requested by the other party. In addition, provided that the Company has not provided Parent with any notice pursuant to _Section 5.2(c)_, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) consult with Parent regarding communications with customers, stockholders, prospective investors and employees related to the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) provide Parent with stockholder lists of the Company and (c) allow and facilitate Parent contact with stockholders of the Company and other prospective investors. 

  

 5.7 _ Indemnification and Insurance._ 

  

  

 (a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time (and until such later date as of which any Legal Proceeding commenced during such six (6) year period shall have been finally disposed of), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and from and after the Upstream Merger, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, assume, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations (including both indemnification and advancement of expenses) of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the certificate of incorporation or any bylaws of the Company or its Subsidiaries or indemnification agreements, in each case, in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time for the benefit of any of its current or former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), to the extent such indemnifiable losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines incurred by the Indemnified Parties arise out of or pertain to matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including any such matter arising 

  

      

  

under any claim with respect to the transactions contemplated herein. In
addition, for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time (and
until such later date as of which any Legal Proceeding commenced during such
six (6) year period shall have been finally disposed of), Parent shall (and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company and their
respective Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate of incorporation,
certificate of formation and bylaws and operating agreement, as applicable
(and other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation,
the Surviving Company and their respective Subsidiaries to contain provisions
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation that
are at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as the indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation provisions contained in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational
documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and during such six (6) year period (and until such later date
as of which any Legal Proceeding commenced during such six (6) year period
shall have been finally disposed of), such provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any respect, except as required by Law.

   

 (b) _ Tail Policy._ The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a six (6) year "tail" prepaid policy (the " _Tail Policy_ ") on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the indemnified parties, or any other person entitled to the benefit of this _Section 5.7_, as applicable, than the existing directors\' and officers\' liability (and fiduciary) insurance maintained by the Company, covering, without limitation, the Merger. 

  

 (c) _ Successors._ If Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with, or merge with or into, any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person, then, in each case, Parent shall take such action as may be necessary so that such Person shall assume all of the applicable obligations set forth in this _Section 5.7_. 

  

 (d) _ Enforceability._ The obligations under this _Section 5.7_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the Tail Policy) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the Tail Policy. Each of the directors and officers or other persons who is an Indemnified Party or a beneficiary under the Tail Policy is intended to be a third-party beneficiary of this _Section 5.7_ with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the Tail Policy) under this _Section 5.7_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity). 

  

  

 5.8 _ Notification of Certain Matters._ 

  

  

 (a) The Company shall give prompt written notice, but in any event no less than within one (1) Business Day, to Parent and Parent shall give prompt written notice, but in any event no less than within one (1) Business Day to the Company, as the case may be, of (i) the discovery by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, of any event, condition, fact, or circumstance that occurred or existed on or prior to the Agreement Date and that caused or constitutes an inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by such party in this Agreement, (ii) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event after the Agreement Date which is likely to cause any representation or warranty of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to be untrue or inaccurate at the Closing Date such that the conditions to closing set forth in _Article VI_ would fail to be satisfied, (iii) any failure by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to materially comply 

  

      

  

with or materially satisfy any covenant or other agreement to be complied
with by it hereunder such that the conditions to closing set forth in
_Article VI_ would fail to be satisfied, and (iv) any event, condition,
fact, or circumstance that would make the timely satisfaction of any of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ impossible or unlikely or that has had
or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.8(a)_ shall not
limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to Parent or the Company,

ARTICLE VIII 

GENERAL 

  

 8.1 _ Amendment or Supplement._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether before or after receipt of the Required Stockholder Vote, by written agreement signed by all of the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that following approval of this Agreement by the Company\'s stockholders, there shall be no amendment of or change to the provisions of this Agreement which, pursuant to applicable Law, would require further approval by the Company\'s stockholders without receipt of such approval. 

        

 8.2 _ Extension of Time, Waiver, etc._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law: (a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto; (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any other party hereto; or (c) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements contained in this Agreement or, except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, waive any of such party\'s conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such rights preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. 

  

 8.3 _ No Survival._ None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. 

  

 8.4 _ Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiary._ This Agreement, including the exhibits and annexes hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the documents and instruments relating to the Merger referred to in this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to create any agreement of employment with any person, to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto, except with respect to: (i) the rights of holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Article II _and the holders of Company Options and Company RSUs to receive the consideration described in _Article II_; and (ii) the directors and officers of the Company pursuant to _Section 5.7_. 

   

 8.5 _ Applicable Law; Jurisdiction._ This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws. All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement or the Merger shall be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and the parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such court (and, in the case of appeals, the appropriate appellate court therefrom), in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties hereto. The parties agree that service of any court paper may be made in any manner as may be provided under the applicable Laws or court rules governing service of process in such court. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT. 

   

 8.6 _ Specific Enforcement._ Notwithstanding _Section 7.3_ of this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with the terms hereof or are otherwise breached, and that the party seeking to enforce this Agreement against such nonperforming party under this Agreement shall be entitled, without proof of damages, to specific performance and the issuance of injunctive and other equitable relief, in addition to any other right or remedy such party may be entitled. The parties hereto further agree to waive any requirement 

        

for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of
any such injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In the event
that any action shall be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of the
Agreement, no party shall allege, and hereby waives the defense, that there is
an adequate remedy at law or that the award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason of law or equity.

  

 8.7 _ Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

If a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision. 

  

 8.10 _ Disclosure Schedules._ The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in sections and paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and paragraphs contained in this Agreement and the disclosure in any section or paragraph shall qualify (a) the corresponding section or paragraph in this Agreement; and (b) other sections and paragraphs in this Agreement only to the extent that it is readily apparent on its face that such disclosure qualifies, and constitutes an exception to, another section or paragraph in this Agreement. 

  

 8.11 _ Counterparts; Signatures._ This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") form, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, or by combination of such means.
