Statement.

 

Section 2.06 _Post-Closing_.

 

(a) _Preparation and Delivery of Post-Closing Statement_. As promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90) calendar days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and
delivered, to Lender a statement (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ "), setting

Deduction Amount as of the Closing, together with a calculation of what the
Lender Cash Repayment Amount would have been at the Closing had such amount
been calculated based on the foregoing amounts, as well as reasonably
detailed supporting documentation for such calculation and any additional
information reasonably requested by Lender in connection with review of the
Post-Closing Statement. In the event that Buyer does not deliver the Post-
Closing Statement to Lender within ninety (90) calendar days after the
Closing Date, each item on the Pre-Closing Statement shall be deemed
undisputed and the Pre-Closing Statement shall be final and binding on the
Parties and not subject to appeal.

(b) _Review of Post-Closing Statement_. Buyer shall provide Lender and
its Representatives with reasonable access (with the right to make copies),
during normal business hours, to the work papers of Buyer, its accountants or
any of its other Representatives related to the preparation of the Post-
Closing Statement, as well as to any of the personnel, property and
facilities and such books and records and other relevant information of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and Buyer shall make available its employees
knowledgeable about the information used in, and the preparation of, the
Post-Closing Statement, in each case to the extent reasonably required by
Lender to complete its review of the Post-Closing Statement. Lender shall have
thirty (30) days following its receipt of the Post-Closing Statement (the "
_Review Period_ ") to review the same. On or before the expiration of the
Review Period, Lender shall deliver to Buyer a written statement accepting or
disputing the Post-Closing Statement. In the event that Lender shall
dispute the Post-Closing Statement, such statement shall include a detailed
itemization of Lenders objections and the reasons therefor (such statement, a
" _Dispute Statement_ "). Any component of the Post-Closing Statement that is
not disputed in a Dispute Statement shall be final and binding on the Parties
and not subject to appeal. If Lender does not deliver a Dispute Statement to
Buyer within the Review Period or delivers a statement accepting the Post-
Closing Statement, the Post-Closing Statement shall be final and binding on
the Parties and not subject to appeal.



 



21 (c) _Dispute Resolution_. If Lender delivers a Dispute Statement during the
Review Period, Buyer and Lender shall promptly meet and attempt in good faith
to resolve their differences with respect to the disputed items set forth in
the Dispute Statement during the thirty (30) calendar days immediately
following Buyers receipt of the Dispute Statement, or such longer period as
Buyer and Lender may mutually agree (the " _Resolution Period_ "). Any such
disputed items that are resolved by Buyer and Lender during the Resolution
Period shall be final and binding on the Parties and not subject to appeal.
If Buyer and Lender do not resolve all such disputed items by the end of the
Resolution Period, Buyer and Lender shall submit all items remaining in
dispute with respect to the Dispute Statement to a nationally recognized
independent accounting or valuation firm upon which Buyer and Lender shall
reasonably agree (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for review and resolution. The
Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not an arbitrator. The Accounting
Firm shall make all calculations in accordance with the practices used in
preparation of the Post-Closing Statement and shall determine only those items
remaining in dispute between Buyer and Lender. Each of Buyer and Lender
shall (i) enter into a customary engagement letter with the Accounting Firm
at the time such dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm and otherwise
cooperate with the Accounting Firm, (ii) have the opportunity to submit a
written statement in support of their respective positions with respect to
such disputed items, to provide supporting material to the Accounting Firm in
defense of their respective positions with respect to such disputed items and
to submit a written statement responding to the other Partys position with
respect to such disputed items ( _provided,_ that any such statements and
materials will be consistent with the Post-Closing Statement in the case of
Buyer, and the Dispute Statement in the case of Lender, and that copies of
all such statements and materials are concurrently provided to the other
Party), and (iii) subject to customary confidentiality and indemnity
agreements, provide the Accounting Firm with access to their
respective books, records, personnel and Representatives and such other
information as the Accounting Firm may require in order to render its
determination. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to deliver to Buyer and
Lender a written determination (such determination to include a worksheet
setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at such determination
and to be based solely on information provided to the Accounting Firm by Buyer
and Lender) of the disputed items within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt
of the disputed items, which determination shall, absent manifest error, be
final and binding on the Parties and not subject to appeal. All fees and
expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Accounting Firm
will be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and Lender, on the other
hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed items
so submitted to the Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by each
such Party (as finally determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the total
disputed amount of such items so submitted. Buyer and Lender each shall bear
the respective fees, costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.06(c)_.

 



22 (d) _Final Lender Cash Repayment Amount_. The Lender Cash Repayment Amount as
deemed final and binding on the Parties pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.06_, is referred to herein as the " _Final_ _Lender Cash Repayment Amount_."
Buyer agrees that the adjustment provided for in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.06_,
and the dispute resolution provisions provided for in this _Section_ __ _
2.06_, shall be the exclusive remedies for any items that are taken into
account in calculating the Aggregate Deduction Amount; provided that the
Parties agree and acknowledge that the foregoing shall not be deemed to limit
the liability of any Person for Fraud.

 

(e) _Settlement of Adjustments_.

 

(i) If the amount of the Final Lender Cash Repayment Amount exceeds the amount
of the Estimated Lender Cash Repayment Amount (such excess amount, the "
_Positive Adjustment Amount_ "), then within three (3) Business Days after the
determination of the Final Lender Cash Repayment Amount, (x) Buyer shall pay
to Lender, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount in cash
equal to the lesser of (1) the Positive Adjustment Amount and (2) $10,000,000,
(y) Buyer and Lender shall deliver joint written instruction to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver the full balance of the Escrow
Account to Lender and (z) Buyer shall issue to Lender the Lender Stock Release
Amount. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall
Buyer be required to make any payments in respect of any adjustments
pursuant to clause (x) of this _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ in excess of
$10,000,000.

(ii) If the amount of the Estimated Lender Cash Repayment Amount exceeds the
amount of the Final Lender Cash Repayment Amount (such excess amount, the "
_Negative Adjustment Amount_ "), then within three (3) Business Days after the
determination of the Final Lender Cash Repayment Amount, Buyer and Lender
shall take the following actions:

(A) If the then remaining balance of the Escrow Account, including earnings
thereon, exceeds the Negative Adjustment Amount, then (x) Lender and Buyer
shall deliver joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to deliver (I) to Buyer, from the Escrow Account, the
Negative Adjustment Amount, and (II) to Lender, the remaining balance of the
Escrow Account, including any earnings thereon, after taking into account the
amounts paid pursuant to the preceding clause (I), and (y) Buyer shall issue
to Lender the Lender Stock Release Amount.

(B) If the Negative Adjustment Amount exceeds the then remaining balance of
the Escrow Account, including any earnings thereon (such excess, the "
_Excess Balance_ "), then (x) Lender and Buyer shall deliver joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver the
full balance of the Escrow Account to Buyer, and (y) Buyer shall issue to
Lender the Remaining Lender Stock Release Amount. For purposes of the
foregoing, the " _Remaining Lender Stock Release Amount_ " means a number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the positive difference, if any, of (x)
the Lender Stock Release Amount, minus the quotient obtained by dividing (y)
the Excess Balance, by (y) the volume weighted average price per share of
Buyer Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ for each of the thirty (30)
consecutive trading days ending on the date immediately prior to the date
hereof (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported thereby,
another alternative source as mutually chosen by the Parties).

(C) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall Seller
or Lender be required to make any payments in respect of any adjustments
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ in excess of the then-remaining balance
of the Escrow Account. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no
event shall Buyer be required to issue any shares of Buyer Common Stock in
respect of any adjustments pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ in excess of
the Lender Stock Release Amount.

 



23 (f) _Tax Treatment_. Any payment made under this _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ shall
be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Lender Cash Repayment
Amount paid at Closing unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has any Liabilities in respect of management fees paid or payable to Seller or

cash set forth on the Cash Schedule will not be capable of becoming
unrestricted within a reasonable period of time following the Closing through
the imposition of replacement letters of credit which are available to Buyer
on commercially reasonable terms or as a result of no longer being required
to remain restricted as the result of Buyers acquisition of the Company and
its Subsidiaries.

quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable federal
Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, (b) the present

preceding the date hereof (all such documents, together with all exhibits and
schedules to the foregoing materials and all information incorporated
therein by reference, the " _Buyer SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective
filing dates (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of
this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), (i) the Buyer SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with then applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may
be, including, in each case, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
and (ii) none of the Buyer SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) The consolidated financial statements of Buyer (including the related
notes and schedules thereto) included (or incorporated by reference) in the
Buyer SEC Documents (i) were prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the

the dates thereof and their respective consolidated results of operations and
cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments that were not,
or are not expected to be, material in amount, and other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto). During the three (3)-year
period immediately preceding the date hereof, Buyer has not made any material
change in the accounting practices or policies applied in the preparation of
its financial statements, except as required by GAAP, SEC rule or policy or
applicable Law.

 



55 (c) Buyer has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that
information relating to Buyer, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
required to be disclosed in Buyers periodic and current reports under the
Exchange Act, is made known to Buyers chief executive officer and its chief
financial officer by others within those entities to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures as required under the Exchange Act.

(d) Buyer and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain a system of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is effective in providing reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of Buyers financial reporting and the
preparation of Buyers financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Buyer has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
of Buyers internal control over financial reporting prior to the date
hereof, to Buyers auditors and audit committee (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of Buyers
internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Buyers ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Buyers
internal control over financial reporting. Buyer has made available to Seller
a true, correct and complete summary of any such disclosures made by
management to Buyers auditors and audit committee.

(e) During the three (3)-year period immediately preceding the date hereof,
(i) neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to Buyers knowledge, any
director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Buyer or
any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of
any material written complaint, allegation, assertion or claim regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting
or auditing practices and (ii) to Buyers knowledge, no attorney representing
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries, has reported in writing evidence of a material violation of
securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation, relating to
such period, by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees or agents to Buyers board of directors or any
committee thereof or to any director or officer of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

(f) There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in the comment letters
received from the SEC staff with respect to the Buyer SEC Documents. None of
the Buyer SEC Documents filed on or prior to the date of this Agreement is
subject to ongoing review or outstanding SEC comment or investigation. There
are no formal SEC inquiries or investigations pending or threatened, in each
case regarding any accounting practices of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



56 (g) Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract, agreement or arrangement (including any
contract, agreement or arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship
between or among Buyer and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract,
agreement or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries in
Buyers or such Subsidiarys published financial statements or other Buyer SEC
Documents.

 

(h) Buyer is in compliance in all material respects with the provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act that are applicable to Buyer.

business or the licensing of intellectual property in connection therewith),
(ii) any joint venture or other strategic investment in or involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any new financing, investment

expressly require the Company to abandon the transactions contemplated herein
(each of the transactions described in the preceding clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) being referred to herein as an " _Alternative Transaction_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, the transactions set forth  _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ of the
Disclosure Schedule shall not constitute Alternative Transactions hereunder to
the extent negotiated, entered into and consummated in accordance with the
descriptions thereof as set forth on such schedule.

(b) During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing or
the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01_,
Seller shall not (and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries and it and
their Representatives not to) take or permit any action to:

notify Buyer thereof, which notice shall include, to the extent permitted by

proposal, indication of interest or request, and the specific terms of such
inquiry, offer, proposal, indication or request, as the case may be (including
a copy of any written material and electronic communications received from
such third party).

(d) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is

money damages as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or
other security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
6.05_ and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which Buyer may be entitled at law or in

Foreign Competition Laws so as to avoid a second phase review). Buyer,
Seller, and Lender shall allow the other Party to review and comment on any
and all regulatory filings as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 6.06(a)_ or any
requests or inquiries as contemplated in this _Section_ __ _ 6.06(b)_ and

attend and participate, thereat. Each of Buyer, Seller, and Lender shall
furnish the other Party with copies of all correspondence, filings
and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof)

hand, with respect to this Agreement (except that such Party shall be
permitted to remove any commercially sensitive information before sharing with
the other Party, or such Party legal counsel may share complete versions on a
counsel-to-counsel basis with such other Partys legal counsel). Buyer,

documentation reasonably required by the other Party in order to prepare any

risk of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Authority necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the
risk of any Governmental Authority seeking or entering an Order prohibiting

Lender prompt notice upon having knowledge of any breach by any party of any

other provision of, or remedies under, the Debt Financing Commitments (or any
definitive agreements related thereto), in each case, to the extent such
amendment, modification, supplement or waiver would reasonably be expected to
have the effect of (A) adversely affecting in any material respect the
ability of Buyer to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (B) amending, modifying, supplementing or waiving the conditions or
contingencies to the Debt Financing in a manner materially adverse to the
Company or Seller or (C) delaying the Closing beyond the Outside Date. In the

be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions) have been satisfied (or waived), Buyer shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except
to the extent (A) additional or alternative financing would then be
available, or (B) such Debt Financing or any additional or alternative
financing would not be required, to consummate the transactions contemplated

Lender of such event and the reasons giving rise to such event, as promptly
as practicable following the occurrence of such event, (ii) arrange to obtain,
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (and in any
event prior to the Outside Date), the Debt Financing or such portion of the
Debt Financing from alternative sources, which may include one or more of a
senior secured debt financing, an offering and sale of notes, or any other
financing or offer and sale of other debt securities, or any combination
thereof, in an amount sufficient, when added to any portion of the Debt
Financing that is and will be available, to pay in cash all amounts required
to be paid by Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (" _Alternative Debt Financing_ ") and (iii) obtain a new financing
commitment letter (together with its related term sheets, the " _Alternative
Debt Financing Commitments_ ") and a new definitive agreement with respect
thereto that provides for financing (A) on terms not materially less
favorable, in the aggregate, to Buyer than the applicable Debt Financing
Commitments as of the date hereof (taking into account the flex provisions
thereof), (B) containing conditions to draw, and other terms that would
reasonably be expected to affect the availability thereof, that (1) are not
more onerous, taken as a whole, than those conditions and terms contained in
the applicable Debt Financing Commitments as of the date hereof and (2) would
not reasonably be expected to delay the Closing and (C) in an amount that is
sufficient, when added to any portion of the Debt Financing that is and will
be available, to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by Buyer in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In such
event, the term "Debt Financing" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
include any Alternative Debt Financing (and consequently the term "Debt
Financing" shall include any available portion of the Debt Financing and the
Alternative Debt Financing), and the term "Debt Financing Commitments" as used
in this Agreement shall be deemed to include any Alternative Debt Financing
Commitments. Buyer shall promptly deliver to Seller and Lender complete and
correct copies of the Alternative Debt Financing Commitments (in customarily
redacted form) obtained pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.09(c)_.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 6.09(c)_, to the extent (A)
additional or alternative financing would then be available, or (B) such Debt
Financing or any additional or alternative financing would not be required,
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing
Date, Buyer shall not be required to obtain any Alternative Debt Financing or
comply with the covenants in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.09(c)_ with respect to
any Alternative Debt Financing Commitments or any definitive agreements
negotiated or entered into in connection with such Alternative Debt Financing
Commitments.

changes reasonably requested by Buyer before adopting such resolutions (so
long as Buyer provides Seller with such requested changes at least two (2)

(b) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ shall (i) be treated as

Plan or other agreement, plan, program or document, (ii) give to any Service
Provider (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof), or any labor
organization, union, works council, employee association, trade union, or

regulations promulgated thereunder) (each such person, a " _280G Individual_
," and such payments and/or benefits, the " _280G Payments_ "), use
commercially reasonable efforts to secure a 280G Waiver (as defined below)
from each such 280G Individual, and (b) seek the approval of the Persons who
are entitled to vote in a manner that complies with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of

adequate written disclosure delivered, prior to such vote, to all holders of
equity interests of the Company who are entitled to vote) (the " _280G Voting
Rules_ ") of any such payments and/or benefits that are subject to an
executed 280G Waiver. For purposes of this Agreement, " _280G Waiver_ " means
a waiver of the 280G Individuals rights to some or all of the payments and/or
benefits applicable to such 280G Individual so that all remaining payments
and/or benefits applicable to such 280G Individual shall not be deemed to be
"excess parachute payments" that would not be deductible under Section 280G of
the Code. Prior to obtaining such waivers, and prior to seeking
such approval, Seller shall provide drafts of such 280G Waivers and such
approval materials to Buyer at least three (3) Business Days prior to

without limitation, the satisfaction of all conditions to the obligations of
the Naperville Landlord to execute and deliver the Naperville Lease

7.04_ shall not limit Buyers obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement).

(b) Except for press releases and other public announcements permitted by the
terms of _Section_ __ _ 7.02_, the Parties shall not, and each of them shall
cause its respective Affiliates, advisors, representatives and agents not to,
disclose the terms and provisions of this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other Party, except as required by Law or legal process.

 



74 (c) In addition to the term of the preceding clause (a), if the transactions
contemplated hereby are not consummated, Buyer shall, and shall cause each of
its Affiliates, advisors, representatives and agents to, maintain the
confidentiality of all non-public, proprietary information obtained during its
or their due diligence review of Seller and the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and shall return to Seller or destroy (and certify in writing to Seller such
destruction) all documents received from Seller and all copies thereof
containing any such information, in each case in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

(d) In addition to the term of the preceding clause (a), from and after the
Closing, Seller and Lender agrees to, and shall cause their respective agents,
representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers and directors to, treat and
hold as confidential all confidential documents and information of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, including any notes, analyses, compilations,
studies, forecasts, interpretations or other documents that are derived from,
contain, reflect or are based upon any such information (the " _Confidential
Information_ ") and refrain from using any Confidential Information except in
connection with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential
Information shall not include information that, at the time of disclosure,
(i) is available publicly and was not disclosed in breach of this Agreement or
(ii) is lawfully acquired by such person after the Closing from sources which
are not prohibited from disclosing such information by legal, contractual or
fiduciary obligation. In the event that Seller or Lender or any of their
respective agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers or
directors is requested or required by Law or any Action or Order to disclose
any Confidential Information, such Person shall provide Buyer with prompt
written notice of such requirement so that Buyer may seek a protective order
or other remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this  _Section_ __
_ 7.04_. In the event that a protective order or other remedy is not obtained
or if Buyer waives compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_, such Person
shall furnish only that portion of such Confidential Information that is
legally required to be provided and exercise its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded such
information.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller, Lender and their
respective Affiliates (including Oaktree) shall in each case be permitted to
disclose the terms and provisions of this Agreement to their respective
existing and prospective investors _provided_ they instruct such Persons to
observe the confidentiality provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.04_, and
Seller shall be liable for any breaches thereof by such parties.

Section 7.05  _Commercially Reasonable Efforts to Complete_. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, including _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ and
_Section_ __ _ 6.06_, Buyer, Lender and Seller shall each cooperate fully
with the other and use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner reasonably practicable, the transactions contemplated
hereby.

Section 7.06 _Provision Respecting Representation of_ _the Company_.

(a) Each of the Parties hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, members, partners, stockholder, officers, employees and
Affiliates, that Kirkland and Ellis LLP may serve as counsel to Seller and each
of Sellers members (including Lender) and their respective Affiliates (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries) (individually and collectively, the "
_Seller Group_ "), on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on
the other hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of this 

 



75  Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Kirkland
and Ellis LLP (or any successor) may serve as counsel to the Seller Group or
any director, member, partner, stockholder, officer, employee or Affiliate of
the Seller Group, in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement notwithstanding such prior representation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and each of the Parties hereby consents thereto and waives
any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such Parties shall
cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to and waive any conflict of interest
arising from such representation.

(b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all communications prior to
the Closing between Seller, Lender or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, personnel or agents, or representatives of any of the
foregoing, on the one hand, and external legal counsel, including Kirkland and
Ellis LLP, on the other hand (" _Privileged Communications_ "), shall not be
deemed under any circumstance to belong to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, notwithstanding that any such Persons may also serve as
officers, directors, agents or representatives of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. From and after the Closing none of the Company,
its Subsidiaries, Buyer or any Person purporting to act on behalf of or
through the Company or its Subsidiaries shall have access to or will seek to
obtain such communications, whether by seeking a waiver of the attorney-client
privilege or through any other means. To the extent that files in respect of
any Privileged Communications constitute property of the client, only the
Seller Group shall hold such property rights. As to any such Privileged
Communications prior to the Closing, Buyer, the Company, and each of its
Subsidiaries together with any of their respective Affiliates, successors or
assigns, further agree that no such party may use or rely on any of the
Privileged Communications in any action against or involving any of
the Parties after the Closing.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, other than as provided for in _Section_ __ _
7.06(b)_, Privileged Communications to which this _Section_ __ _ 7.06_
relates do not include communications between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and their external legal counsel, including
Kirkland and Ellis LLP, on the other hand, made prior to the Closing, it being
understood that such communications shall remain property of the Company and
its Subsidiaries following the Closing.

 

Section 7.07 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) not
to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify the indemnification provisions of the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement or
other similar governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
as in effect at the Closing in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of individuals who at the Closing were directors, officers,
managers, employees or holders of equity interests of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

 



76 (b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the
covenants contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.07_, without limit as to time.
In addition to the other rights provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 7.07_,
and not in limitation thereof, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, a " _D andO Indemnifying Party_") to, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) indemnify and hold
harmless (and release from any liability to Buyer or the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries), current and former managers, directors and officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, determined as of immediately prior to the
Closing (each, a " _D andO Indemnitee_"), against all DandO Expenses (as defined
below), losses, liabilities, claims, damages, judgments or amounts paid in
settlement (collectively, " _D andO Costs_") in respect of any threatened,
pending or completed claim or Action, whether criminal, civil, administrative
or investigative, based on, arising out of or relating to the fact that such
Person is or was a manager, director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Closing (a " _D andO Indemnifiable Claim_") and (ii) advance to such DandO
Indemnitees all DandO Expenses incurred in connection with any DandO Indemnifiable
Claim (including in circumstances where the DandO Indemnifying Party has
assumed the defense of such claim) promptly after receipt of reasonably
detailed statements therefor; provided, however, that the Person to whom DandO
Expenses are to be advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to such
indemnification under applicable Law. Any DandO Indemnifiable Claim shall
continue until such DandO Indemnifiable Claim is disposed of or all judgments,
orders, decrees or other rulings in connection with such DandO Indemnifiable
Claim are fully satisfied. For the purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.07_, "
_D andO Expenses_" means attorneys fees and all other costs, charges and
expenses paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a
witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend,
be a witness in or participate in any DandO Indemnifiable Claim, but shall
exclude losses, judgments and amounts paid in settlement (which items are
included in the definition of DandO Costs). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
be required to indemnify or hold harmless any DandO Indemnitee for amounts paid
in settlement unless the Company approves such settlement in writing, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. For the avoidance of doubt, the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.07(b)_ are obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries are not being assumed nor guaranteed by Buyer.

 

(c) Buyer, on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries from and after the
Closing, waives, with respect to any indemnification or advancement of
expenses of any DandO Indemnitee, any right against Oaktree and/or Marlin to
indemnification, subrogation or contribution. Buyer agrees, on behalf of the
Company and its Subsidiaries from and after the Closing, that Oaktree and
Marlin are each an intended third party beneficiary as to the indemnification
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.07_ and shall be entitled to bring suit
to enforce said provisions.

 

(d) At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause the Company to,
obtain, maintain and fully pay for irrevocable "tail" insurance policies
naming all Persons who were directors or officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing as direct beneficiaries with a claims period
of at least six (6) years from the Closing Date from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance
and related coverages that are under the same policy in an amount and scope at
least as favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that the
cost of

 



77  the annual premium for such "tail" insurance policies shall not exceed two
hundred fifty percent (250%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage
for its last full fiscal year, and such cost shall be borne fifty percent
(50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Seller, and to the extent unpaid
prior to the Closing, Sellers portion thereof shall be deemed Company
Transaction Expenses.

 

(e) In the event Buyer, the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity in such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in
either such case, Buyer shall make proper provision so that the successors and
assigns of Buyer or the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall
assume or otherwise remain liable for the obligations set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.07_. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.07_ shall
survive the consummation of the Closing.

 

Section 7.08 _Post-Closing Record Retention and Access_. From and after the
Closing, Buyer shall provide Seller and its authorized representatives with
reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and copying), during normal
business hours, to any books and records and other materials in the possession
of the Company in connection with any matter relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or relating to periods
or occurrences prior to or on the Closing Date (including the preparation of
Tax Returns, to verify any item or information relevant pursuant to
this Agreement, amended Tax Returns or claims for refund (and any materials
necessary for the preparation of any of the foregoing), the preparation of
financial statements including for periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, and the management and handling of any Action, whether or not such
Action is a matter with respect to which indemnification may be sought
hereunder), or compliance with the rules and regulations of the Internal
Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other
Governmental Authority. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by Seller,
Buyer shall not and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, for a
period of five (5) years (or seven (7) years in respect of Tax-related
matters) following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of
any books and records and other materials of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
or any portions thereof, relating to periods prior to the Closing Date
without first offering to surrender to Seller such books and records and
materials or such portions thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall
be entitled to require any Person (other than Seller) requesting any such
information to execute a customary confidentiality agreement with respect
thereto prior to the provision thereof.

Section 7.09  _Other Tax Provisions_.

(a) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. __ Buyer and Seller shall provide reasonable
cooperation, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in
connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return and any audit,

Section 7.10 _Transfer Taxes_. All sales and transfer taxes, recording charges
and similar taxes, fees or charges imposed as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Transfer Taxes_ "),
together with any interest, penalties or additions to such Transfer Taxes,
shall be borne by fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by
Seller. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in timely making all filings,
returns, reports and forms as necessary or appropriate to comply with the
provisions of all applicable Laws in connection with the payment of such
Transfer Taxes.

Section 7.11 _Additional Agreements of Buyer_.

 

(a) Buyer acknowledges that in making its determination to proceed with the

(the foregoing clauses (a), (b) and (c) collectively, the " _Covered
Representations_ "). 

(b) The Covered Representations described in clause (a) of the definition
thereof constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of
or regarding Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries to Buyer in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, and Buyer (i) represents, warrants
and agrees that it has not relied upon the accuracy or completeness of any
other representation, warranty, statement or information of any kind or nature
expressed or implied (including in respect of any of the financial condition,
results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and projected
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or in respect of the accuracy
or completeness of any information regarding the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries furnished or Made Available to Buyer and its representatives) and
(ii) waives any right Buyer may have against Seller with respect to any
inaccuracy of any such other representation, warranty, statement or
information or with respect to any omission or nondisclosure, on the part of
Seller or any representative of Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof, of any potentially material information. In connection with Buyers
investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, Buyer has received certain
projections, including projected statements of operating revenues and
income from operations of

 



79  the Company and its Subsidiaries and certain business plan information.
Buyer acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make
such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that Buyer is
familiar with such uncertainties and that Buyer is taking full responsibility
for making its own evaluation of, and expressly disclaims reliance upon, the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and
plans so furnished to it, including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts, provided that to the
extent any fact or matter contained therein is expressly the subject of
a Covered Representation, the foregoing shall not be deemed to encompass, or
a disclaimed or reliance on, such fact or matter solely with respect to such
Covered Representation. Accordingly, Buyer hereby acknowledges that none of
Seller, the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective direct or
indirect Affiliates or representatives (or any of their directors, officers,
employees, members, managers, partners or agents) is making any representation
or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections and other forecasts
and plans, including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections and forecasts, provided that to the extent any fact or
matter contained therein is expressly the subject of a Covered
Representation, the foregoing shall not be deemed to an acknowledgment of a
failure to make a representation or warranty with respect to such fact or
matter pursuant to such Covered Representation.

 

(c) The Covered Representations described in clause (b) of the definition
thereof constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of
or regarding Lender to Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, and Buyer (x) represents, warrants and agrees that it has not relied
upon the accuracy or completeness of any other representation,
warranty, statement or information of any kind or nature expressed or
implied, and (y) waives any right Buyer may have against Lender with respect
to any inaccuracy of any such other representation, warranty, statement or
information or with respect to any omission or nondisclosure, on the part of
Lender or any representative of Lender of any potentially material
information.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree and acknowledge that
this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_ shall not be deemed to limit the liability of any
Person for, or disclaim any reliance by Buyer or any other Person with respect
to, Fraud.

Section 7.12 _R andW Insurance_. It is understood and agree that Buyer intends
to obtain a buyer-side representations and warranties insurance policy as a
source of recovery for any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
of Seller and Lender set forth herein (the " _R andW Policy_"). From the date of
this Agreement until the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01_, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain a RandW Policy to be effective at or prior to the Closing on
terms reasonably acceptable to Buyer. In the event such RandW Policy is
obtained at or prior to the Closing, the premium in respect of the RandW Policy
shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Seller,
and to the extent unpaid by Seller prior to the Closing, Sellers portion
thereof shall be deemed Company Transaction Expenses. Without limitation on
the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.12_, in the event that such
RandW Policy is obtained following the Closing, Buyer shall issue to Lender the
Lender Stock RandW Policy Amount within two (2) Business Days of obtaining such
RandW Policy; _provided_ , that the obligation set forth in this sentence shall
expire on the first anniversary of the Closing Date if no such RandW Policy is
obtained by such date.

 



80  Any such RandW Policy shall include a provision whereby the insurer expressly
waives, and agrees not to pursue, directly or indirectly, any subrogation
rights against Seller, Lender or their respective Affiliates, or any former
or current general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members,
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives of any of the
foregoing with respect to any claim made by any insured thereunder (except
for Fraud). No insured party under the RandW Policy shall waive, amend, modify
or otherwise revise this subrogation provision, or allow such provision to be
waived, amended, modified, or otherwise revised without the prior written
consent of Seller and Lender.

Section 7.13 _Termination of Interested Party Transactions_. At or prior to
the Closing, the Company shall cause to be terminated all Contracts set forth

further liability or obligation on the part of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of such Contracts.

Lender agrees and consents to the entry of stop-transfer instructions with
Buyers transfer agent and registrar against the Transfer of the Lender Stock
Repayment Amount, the Lender Stock RandW Policy Amount and the Lender Stock
Release Amount (or Remaining Lender Stock Release Amount, as the case may be)
in violation of the foregoing restrictions.

(b) Any certificate issued in respect of the Lender Stock Repayment Amount,
the Lender Stock RandW Policy Amount or the Lender Stock Release Amount (or
Remaining Lender Stock Release Amount, as the case may be) shall bear a legend
or legends (and appropriate comparable notations or other arrangements will
be made with respect to any uncertificated shares) referencing the
restrictions on Transfer under this Agreement and the Securities Act, which
legend shall state in substance:

 

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE "ACT") AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall deliver new certificates for all

Policy Amount or the Lender Stock Release Amount (or Remaining Lender Stock
Release Amount, as the case may be) not bearing such legend (or shall
eliminate and terminate the notations and arrangements made with respect to
any uncertificated shares) at such time as such the foregoing restrictions are
no longer applicable.

 

Section 7.15 _Release_. Effective for all purposes as of the Closing, Seller
and Lender (solely in its capacity as an indirect equityholder of the
Company) acknowledges and agrees, each on behalf of itself and its current or
former Affiliates (including the other members of the Seller Group), officers,
directors, employees, managers, partners, principals, advisors,
agents, stockholders, members, investors, equity holders or other
representatives (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants,
consultants, bankers and financial advisors), family members, heirs,
beneficiaries, estates, executors, administrators, trustees, successors or

has no Claims (as defined below), (y) has not transferred or assigned, or
purported to transfer or assign, any Claims, and (z) shall not transfer or
assign, or purport to transfer or assign, any Claims, in each case, relating
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries against the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or their respective current or former Affiliates, subdivisions,

agents, stockholders, members, investors, equity holders or other
representatives (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants,
consultants, bankers and financial advisors), successors, predecessors or
assigns (collectively, the " _Released Parties_ ").

(a) Such Releasing Party hereby unconditionally, irrevocably and forever

and whether vicarious, derivative, joint, several or secondary) relating to
the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as may be existing on or before the Closing (collectively, "
_Claims_ ") which such Releasing Party has or had or can, shall or may now or
hereafter have; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing release shall not
cover (and the definition of Claims shall not include) any rights of Seller
or any other member of the Seller Group provided for under this Agreement.

 



82 (b) Such Releasing Party acknowledges and agrees that it is familiar with
Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California (" _Section_ __ _
1542_"), which provides as follows:

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

 

Such Releasing Party hereby waives and relinquishes any rights and benefits
that such Releasing Party may have under Section 1542 or any similar
statute or common law principle of any jurisdiction to the full extent that
it may lawfully waive all such rights and benefits pertaining to the subject
matter hereof. Such Releasing Party acknowledges that it may hereafter
discover facts in addition to, or different from, those that such Releasing
Party now knows or believes to be true with respect to the subject matter of
this release, but it is such Releasing Partys intention to fully and finally
and forever settle and release any and all Claims (other than as explicitly
otherwise set forth herein) that do now exist, may exist or heretofore have
existed with respect to the subject matter of this release. In furtherance of
this intention, the releases contained herein shall be and remain in effect
as full and complete releases notwithstanding the discovery or existence of
any such additional or different facts.

(c) Such Releasing Party acknowledges and agrees that it (x) has read and
understands this release and has been advised to seek legal counsel prior to
signing this Agreement and has had ample opportunity to do so, (x) has signed
this Agreement, including the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.15_ freely
and voluntarily and (y) does not rely, and has not relied, on any
representation or statement not set forth in this release made by Buyer or any
other Person with regard to the subject matter, basis or effect of this
release or otherwise.

(d) This release shall become effective only upon the consummation of the
Closing pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Section 7.16 _Treatment of Monetary Obligations Under Naperville Lease_. To
the extent that Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
receives a reimbursement from Landlord after the Building Income (as defined
in the Naperville Lease Amendment) equals or exceeds $22,000,000, inclusive
of the Naperville Tenants payments of Basic Rent (as defined in the
Naperville Lease Amendment), Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Lender
an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of any such reimbursement
actually received from the Naperville Landlord. Additionally, in the event
the Impositions Reimbursement (as defined in the Naperville Lease Amendment)
is reduced in accordance with Section 5.20(b) of the Naperville Lease
Amendment, Buyer shall, pay, or cause to be paid, to Lender an amount equal
to fifty percent (50%) of such monthly reduction to the Impositions
Reimbursement through the expiration or earlier termination of the of the Term
(as defined in the Naperville Lease). In the event that the Naperville Lease

the Naperville Lease Amendment, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Lender an amount equal to the product of (i) fifty percent (50%) multiplied
by (ii) the aggregate amount of Impositions Reimbursement which would have
been payable pursuant to the Naperville Lease

 



83  had such early termination not occurred, _minus_ any amounts previously paid
to Lender pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.16_; _provided_ , that, in no
event shall the amounts paid or caused to be paid by Buyer pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.16_ exceed $17,500,000. Any amounts payable pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.16_ shall be paid to Lender in cash, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated by Lender, promptly
following such time or times as and to the extent that Buyer, the Company or
any of their respective Affiliates actually receives the benefit of a
reimbursement from Landlord after the Building Income equals or exceeds
$22,000,000, inclusive of the Naperville Tenants payments of Basic Rent or
such reduction of the Impositions Reimbursement or promptly following the

Section 9.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated as provided
below:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

 

(b) by either Seller or Buyer if there has been a material breach or failure
to perform on the part of the other Party (and, with respect to Buyer,
Lender) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would reasonably be
expected to cause the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.01(a)_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)_, or _Section_ __ _ 8.02(a)_ or _Section_ __ _
8.02(b)_, as applicable, to not be satisfied at the Closing and which breach
or failure, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within ten
(10) Business Days following receipt by such other Party of written notice of
such breach or failure from the terminating Party (it being understood and
hereby agreed that neither Party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 9.01(b)_ with respect to such breach or failure if such
breach or failure is adequately cured within such ten (10) Business Day
period); _provided_ that the failure by Buyer to make the payments required
by _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_- _Section 2.04(d)_ , in each case as and when
required hereunder, shall not be subject to cure hereunder unless otherwise
agreed to in writing by Seller;

Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.01(c)_ shall have complied with
its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.06_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.05_); or

 

(d) by either Seller or Buyer if the transactions contemplated hereby have not

those conditions that by their terms are not to be satisfied at the Closing,
which conditions shall be capable of being satisfied at such time, and (ii)
any or all of the conditions set in _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)_, _Section_ __ _
8.01(i)_,  _Section_ __ _ 8.02(c)_, and _Section_ __ _ 8.02(e)_ (but solely
to the extent the matter giving rise to the failure of such condition is

ARTICLE X

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 10.01 _No Survival; Certain Waivers_.

 

(a) The representations and warranties and covenants and agreements (to the
extent contemplating or requiring performance prior to the Closing) of
Seller, Lender and Buyer set forth in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered in connection with this Agreement shall not survive the Closing;
_provided_ that the representations and warranties set forth in  _Section_ __
_ 4.10_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.06_, solely with respect to the Lender Stock
RandW Policy Amount shall survive the Closing until the earlier of the issuance
of the Lender Stock RandW Policy Amount, if any, and such time as the Lender
Stock RandW Policy Amount is no longer potentially issuable pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the representations and
warranties set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 4.10_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.06_,
solely with respect to the Lender Stock Release Amount or Remaining Lender
Stock Release Amount, as the case may be, shall survive the Closing until the
issuance of the Lender Stock Release Amount or Remaining Lender Stock Release
Amount, as the case may be (or, if no such amount is due to Lender pursuant to
_Section_

 



88   _2.06_ , the date on which the Lender Cash Repayment Amount is finally
determined thereunder). Each of the representations and warranties of Seller,
Lender and Buyer set forth in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered
in connection with this Agreement shall terminate effective immediately as of
the Closing such that no claim for breach of any such representation or
warranty, detrimental reliance or other right or remedy (whether in contract,
in tort or at law or in equity) may be brought after the Closing with respect
thereto against Seller or Lender. The covenants and agreements of Seller,
Lender and Buyer set forth in this Agreement and in any other
document delivered in connection herewith to the extent contemplating or
requiring performance prior to the Closing shall terminate effective
immediately as of the Closing such that no claim for breach of any such
covenant or agreement, detrimental reliance or other right or remedy (whether
in contract, in tort, at law or in equity) may be brought after the Closing
with respect thereto against Seller, Lender or Buyer. Each covenant or
agreement herein requiring performance at or after the Closing, shall, in
each case, expressly survive the Closing, and nothing in this _Section_ __ _
10.01(a)_ shall be deemed to limit any rights or remedies of any Party for
breach of any such surviving covenant or agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing limitations shall not apply to the representations and
warranties, covenants and agreements in the Required Payoff Letters or the
representations and warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in any
other written agreement delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Parties agree and acknowledge that this _Section_ __ _ 10.01_ shall not
be deemed to limit the liability of any Person for Fraud.

 

(b) Buyer, for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries), acknowledges and agrees that,
from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may have against any
member of the Seller Group, other than Seller under the terms of this
Agreement solely with respect to any covenant or obligations hereunder which
do not terminate at the Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01(a)_ (such
covenants or obligations, the " _Surviving Covenants_ "), relating to the
operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses
or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules hereto or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether
arising under, or based upon, any federal, state, local or foreign statute,
law (including common law), ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise
(including any right, whether arising at law or in equity, to seek
indemnification, contribution, cost recovery, damages or any other recourse
or remedy, including as may arise under common law) are hereby irrevocably
waived. Furthermore, without limiting the generality of this _Section_ __ _
10.01_, no claim shall be brought or maintained by, or on behalf of, Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) against any member of the Seller Group, and no recourse shall be
sought or granted against any of them, by virtue of, or based upon, any
alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Seller or any other
Person set forth or contained in this Agreement, any certificate, instrument,
opinion, agreement or other document of Seller, Lender or any other Person
delivered hereunder, the subject matter of this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules hereto or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the
business or the ownership, operation, management, use or control of the
business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their assets, or
any actions or omissions at, or prior to, the Closing other than the Surviving
Covenants; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this 
_Section_ __ _ 10.01(b)_ shall be deemed to limit any liabilities or any
claims arising in connection with executory obligations under Contracts
unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Parties agree and acknowledge that this _Section_ __ _
10.01(b)_ shall not be deemed to limit the liability of any Person for, or be
deemed a waiver of any claims against any Person with respect to, Fraud.

 



89 (c) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this 
_Section_ __ _ 10.01_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and that, without these agreements set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 10.01_, Seller would not enter into this Agreement or
otherwise agree to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 10.02 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended
to, and shall not, confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except,
solely with respect to _Section_ __ _ 10.03_,  _Section_ __ _ 10.10_,
_Section_ __ _ 10.11_, _Section_ __ _ 10.12_, _Section_ __ _ 10.13_ and
this _Section_ __ _ 10.02_, the Financing Sources.

 

Section 10.03 _Financing Source Liability_. No Financing Source shall have any
liability to Seller, any member of the Seller Group or any of their
respective Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt
Financing Commitments, the Debt Financing or for any obligations or
liabilities of the Parties or for any claim (whether at law, or equity, in
tort, contract or otherwise), based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement, in no event shall Seller or any member of the
Seller Group have any rights or claims against any of the Financing Sources
under this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitments or the Debt Financing,
and Seller agrees not to and to cause the Seller Group not to, (i) seek to
enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement
against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Financing Source or
(ii) seek to enforce the commitment against, make any claims for breach of
the Debt Financing Commitments against, or seek to recover monetary damages
from, or otherwise sue, the Financing Sources for any reason, including in
connection with the Debt Financing Commitments or the obligations of the
Financing Sources thereunder. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 10.03_ shall in
any way limit or qualify the obligations and liabilities of the parties to the
Debt Financing Commitments to each other or in connection therewith.

 

Section 10.04 _Remedies_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by the Parties in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that Buyer, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, including the
right of Seller to cause Buyer to fully perform the terms of this Agreement to
the fullest extent permissible pursuant to this Agreement and applicable Laws
and to thereafter cause this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement. Such remedies shall, however, be cumulative and not
exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies which any Party may
have under this Agreement. Each of the Parties hereby waives (a) any defenses
in any action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy
at law would be adequate, and (b) any requirement under any Law to post a bond
or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. If any
Party brings any

 



90  Action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement by the other Party, the Outside Date shall automatically be
extended for so long as the Party bringing such Action is actively seeking a
court order for an injunction or injunctions or to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.05 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Disclosure
Schedule, the exhibits hereto, the Confidentiality Agreement and the other
documents referred to herein constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
and supersede any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or
among the Parties, written or oral, that may have related in any way to the
subject matter hereof.

Section 10.06 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement or
any of its rights or interests or delegate any of its obligations hereunder
without the prior written approval of the other Party; _provided_ that (a)
Buyer may (i) assign any or all of its respective rights and interests
hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates or to any lender providing
financing for the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) designate one or
more of its Affiliates to perform its respective obligations hereunder;
_provided_ , _however_ , in either case of clause (i) or (ii), Buyer shall
remain responsible for the performance of all of its respective obligations
hereunder; and (b) after the Closing, Seller may assign this agreement to any
of its beneficial owners or successors by operation of law so long as such
beneficial owners or successors agree to satisfy Sellers obligations under
this Agreement.

Section 10.07 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement and any amendments
hereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of digital imaging and
electronic mail or a facsimile machine, shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original contract and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person.

 

Section 10.08 _Headings_. The section headings contained in this Agreement are
inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.
