PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of the 29th day
of June, 2004, by and among MARINER HEALTH CARE, INC., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), NATIONAL SENIOR CARE, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Purchaser") and NCARE Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly
owned subsidiary of Purchaser ("Merger Sub").   WHEREAS, the Company\'s
subsidiaries are engaged in the ownership and operation of a portfolio of
skilled nursing facilities, long-term acute care hospitals and other health
care facilities and related activities (such activities being hereinafter
referred to as the "Business"); and   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of
Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company have approved this Agreement and the
Merger (as defined below).   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE
I  THE MERGER   Section 1.1 The Merger. (a) At the Effective Time (as
defined in subsection (b) below), Merger Sub shall be merged (the "Merger")
with and into the Company in accordance with Sections 251(a), (b) and (c) of
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "GCL"), whereupon
the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").   (b) The Merger shall
become effective at the time and on the date on which a Certificate of Merger
meeting the requirements of Sections 103 and 251(c) of the GCL (the "Merger
Certificate") is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
or, if later, the date specified in the Merger Certificate (the "Effective
Time"). The Certificate of Merger shall be submitted for filing concurrently
with the Closing of the Merger (the "Closing"). The Closing shall take place
at the offices of Jenkens and Gilchrist Parker Chapin LLP, 405 Lexington
Avenue, New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m. on the date which is five (5)
business days after the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereby,
waiver of all conditions to the Merger, other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be fulfilled at the closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions (the "Closing Date"), or on
such other date or at such other place as the parties may agree.   (c) From
and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the
assets, rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject to all of
the liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and
Merger Sub, all as provided under the GCL.   1   Section 1.2 Conversion of
Shares. At the Effective Time:   (a) Each share of common stock, $.01 par
value per share (the "Common Stock") of the Company outstanding (including
Restricted Stock (as defined below) under the Company\'s 2003 Outside
Directors\' Stock Incentive Plan (the "2003 Plan"), vested at the Effective
Time pursuant to Section 1.3(b), the issuance of which has not been
deferred), but excluding (i) shares of such Common Stock as to which
appraisal rights are timely and properly perfected and not withdrawn prior to
the Effective Time, (ii) shares of Common Stock covered by clause (b) below
and (iii) Restricted Stock under the 2003 Plan as to which issuance remains
deferred immediately prior to the Effective Time (such outstanding Common
Stock of the Company other than the shares referred to in clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii) of this Section 1.2(a) being referred to as the "Shares"), shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive $30.00 (Thirty Dollars and
00/100) in cash per Share (such price per Share being referred to as the
"Stock Price" and the Stock Price multiplied by such Shares being referred to
as the "Aggregate Stock Price") payable, without interest, in the manner
provided in Section 1.4, to the holder of such Shares, upon surrender of (1)
the certificate that formerly evidenced such Shares or (2) book-entry Shares.
All Shares converted pursuant to this Section 1.2(a) shall, from and after
the Effective Time, no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and each holder thereof shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Stock Price.   (b) Each share of Common Stock that is held by the
Company as treasury stock or owned by Purchaser or any subsidiary of
Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled, retired
and cease to exist and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.   (c)
Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation
and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.   Section 1.3 Stock Options; Restricted Stock.  
(a) All options to acquire Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the "Options") under the Company\'s 2002 Stock Incentive Plan
(the "2002 Plan"), whether or not then exercisable, shall (by all necessary
and appropriate action which shall be taken by the Board of Directors of the
Company (the "Company\'s Board") or such appropriate committee or committees
thereof) be canceled at the Effective Time and each holder of an Option shall
(i) be entitled to receive therefor an amount in cash equal to the excess, if
any, of the Stock Price over the per share exercise price of such Option,
multiplied by the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to
such Option (the "Option Price" for each such Option and the aggregate amount
so payable with respect to all Options being referred to as the "Aggregate
Option Price"), without interest, in the manner provided in Section 1.4, to
the holder of such Option, upon surrender of the agreement representing the
applicable Option, in full settlement of the Company\'s (and the Surviving
Corporation\'s) obligations under each such Option, or (ii) to the extent
that the per share exercise price of any Option equals or exceeds the Stock
Price, at the Effective Time, not receive or be entitled to receive any
consideration from   2  Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation
in respect of such Option. Each Option shall after the Effective Time,
represent for all purposes, only the right to receive the cash consideration,
if any, therefor contemplated by this Section 1.3(a).   (b) All Restricted
Stock awarded prior to the Effective Time (the "Restricted Stock") under the
2003 Plan shall (by all necessary appropriate action which shall be taken by
the Company\'s Board or such committee or committees thereof) be fully vested
at the Effective Time. All Restricted Stock that remains deferred at the
Effective Time (the "Deferred Restricted Stock") shall be cancelled and the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount equal
to the Stock Price multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock subject
to such Restricted Stock award (the "Deferred Restricted Stock Price" for
each such award and the aggregate amount so payable with respect to all
Deferred Restricted Stock awards being referred to as the "Aggregate Deferred
Restricted Stock Price"), payable, without interest, in the manner provided
in Section 1.4 to each holder of the Deferred Restricted Stock, upon
surrender of the award representing the Deferred Restricted Stock. Each share
of Deferred Restricted Stock shall, after the Effective Time, represent for
all purposes, only the right to receive the cash consideration
contemplated by this Section 1.3(b). The sum of the Aggregate Stock Price,
the Aggregate Option Price and the Aggregate Deferred Restricted Stock Price
is being referred to as the "Aggregate Purchase Price."   (c) The Company
shall deliver to Purchaser, at least ten days prior to the Closing Date,
updated lists of (i) the holders of Options, indicating the number of Options
held by each holder thereof and the exercise price, expiration date and
exercisability of such Options, and (ii) the holders of Restricted Stock and
Deferred Restricted Stock, indicating, with respect to both items, as
applicable, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each award held
by each holder thereof, whether such Restricted Stock is issued
and outstanding or the issuance thereof has been deferred, the vesting
schedule thereof and the forfeiture date thereof.   Section 1.4 Payment of
Aggregate Purchase Price.   (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall
designate a bank or trust company, reasonably acceptable to, and on terms
approved by the Company, to act as exchange agent ("Exchange Agent") for the
payment of the Aggregate Purchase Price to stockholders of the Company,
holders of Options and holders of Deferred Restricted Stock, entitled to
payment thereof pursuant to Sections 1.2(a), 1.3(a) and 1.3(b) hereof,
respectively. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, by wire transfer in immediately available
funds, in trust with the Exchange Agent, in cash, the Aggregate Purchase
Price. Promptly after the Effective Time but in no event more than five (5)
business days after the Effective Time, Purchaser will send, or will cause
the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of Shares, Options or Deferred
Restricted Stock, as the case may be, at the Effective Time a letter of
transmittal applicable to the Shares, Options or Deferred Restricted Stock,
as the case may be, held by such holder for use in exchanging such holder\'s
Shares, Options or Deferred Restricted Stock, as the case may be, for the
consideration payable with respect to the Shares, Options or
Deferred Restricted Stock held by such holder, as the case may be, pursuant
to Sections 1.2(a), 1.3(a) and 1.3(b) hereof, as appropriate (which shall be
in form and substance satisfactory to the Purchaser and which shall specify
that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the certificates representing Shares or  
3  other documentation representing such Options or Deferred Restricted
Stock awards, as the case may be, to the Exchange Agent).   (b) Each holder
of Shares, Options and Deferred Restricted Stock that have been converted
into a right to receive the appropriate consideration as set forth in
Sections 1.2(a), 1.3(a) and 1.3(b) hereof, upon surrender to the Exchange
Agent of: (i) a certificate or certificates representing such Shares, or, in
the case of Shares represented by a book-entry position, transmission of an
agents\' message to the Exchange Agent in connection with the book-
entry Shares to be surrendered; (ii) an agreement representing the Options to
be surrendered; or (iii) an award representing the Deferred Restricted Stock
to be surrendered, will be entitled to receive, in exchange therefor, cash
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Sections 1.2(a),
1.3(a) or 1.3(b) hereof, as applicable, in the form of a check to be mailed
(or made available by hand if so elected by the surrendering holder of a
Share, Option or Deferred Restricted Stock, provided that payment by hand is
permissible by the Exchange Agent) to such holder. The certificate or
certificates for Shares, the electronic position for book-entry Shares, the
agreement representing the Option or award representing Deferred Restricted
Stock, as the case may be, so surrendered shall be cancelled and the holder
thereof shall receive the appropriate consideration therefor.   (c) After
the Effective time there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Shares. If after the Effective Time, certificates representing Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
as provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this
Section.   (d) All monies delivered by Purchaser to the Exchange Agent
(the "Merger Consideration Fund") shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as
set forth in an Exchange Agent Agreement between the Company and the Exchange
Agent (so long as such directions do not impair the rights of the holders of
Shares) in direct obligations of the United States of America, obligations
for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is
pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, commercial
paper rated of the highest quality by Moody\'s Investors Service Inc. or
Standard and Poor\'s Corporation or certificates of deposit issued by a
commercial bank having combined capital, surplus and undivided profits
aggregating at least $500,000,000 (provided that no such investment made
prior to the thirtieth day after the Effective Time shall mature more than
seven (7) days after such investment is made), and any net earnings with
respect thereto shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation as and when
requested by the Surviving Corporation, provided that, subject to Section
1.4(e), at all times funds sufficient for the payment of the Stock Price,
Options Price and Deferred Restricted Stock Price, in accordance with
the provisions hereof shall be available to the Exchange Agent.   (e) Any
portion of the Merger Consideration Fund made available to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Sections 1.4(a) and that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Shares, Options or Deferred Restricted Stock, 24 months after the Effective
Time shall be returned to Purchaser, upon demand, and any such holder that
has not exchanged such holder\'s Shares, Options or Deferred Restricted Stock
in accordance with this Section 1.4 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Purchaser to exchange such Shares, Option or Deferred
Restricted Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be
liable to any holder of Shares, Options or Deferred Restricted Stock for any
amount paid to a public official pursuant to   4  applicable abandoned
property laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares, Options
or Deferred Restricted Stock three (3) years after the Effective Time (or
such earlier date prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any governmental entity) shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of Purchaser, free and clear
of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Person" means an individual, a corporation,
a company, a partnership, an association, a trust or any other entity
or organization, including a government or political subdivision or any
agency or instrumentality thereof.   (f) In the event that any certificates
evidencing Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Stock
Price related to the Shares represented by such certificates; provided,
however, that Purchaser may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent
to the payment of the Stock Price, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as Purchaser may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to
the certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   (g) If
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares (other than
upon the exercise of Options), or any similar transaction, or any stock
dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the
Aggregate Purchase Price shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the
holders of Shares, Options or Deferred Restricted Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.   Section 1.5
Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 1.2, Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not
voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who
has demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with the GCL shall not
be converted into a right to receive the Stock Price unless such holder fails
to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal. If after
the Effective Time such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his
right to appraisal, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Stock Price.
The Company shall give Purchaser prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of Shares, and Purchaser shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Purchaser,
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands. Purchaser shall be responsible for any and all payments required to
be made with respect to Shares for which the holder thereof has perfected
(and not withdrawn) his dissenter\'s rights, as well as the costs and
expenses of all proceedings relating to the adjudication and/or settlement
thereof, subject to Purchaser\'s right to enforce the closing condition set
forth in Section 8.2(e) hereof with respect to the maximum permissible number
of Shares which may be the subject of perfected appraisal rights.   Section
1.6 Change in Control Payments. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, by wire transfer in
immediately available   5  funds, in trust with the Company, in cash, an
amount sufficient to satisfy all Change of Control Payments (as defined
below), which are due and payable at the Closing. Purchaser shall pay or
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay each employee of the Company listed on
Schedule 1.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule who, by reason of the
consummation of the Merger, is entitled to receive a payment of compensation
from the Company pursuant to an agreement or arrangement existing on the date
hereof (a "Change in Control Payment") the amount to which he or she is

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   The Company hereby
represents and warrants to Merger Sub and Purchaser that, subject to Section
10.12 hereof, except as disclosed anywhere in the Company Disclosure Schedule
delivered by the Company to Purchaser simultaneously with the execution and
delivery hereof (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"; reference herein and in
the Company Disclosure Schedule to the Company shall include all Subsidiaries
(as defined below), unless the context otherwise requires):   Section 3.1
Organization and Qualification. The Company is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
full corporate power and authority to own its properties and to conduct the
businesses in which it is now engaged. The Company is authorized or qualified
to do business and is in good standing in each other jurisdiction in which
the character of the property owned, leased or operated by the Company,
or the nature of the business or activities conducted by the Company, make
such authorization or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be
so qualified or in good standing would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect (as defined below). The Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth all
jurisdictions in which the Company is authorized or qualified to do business.
Except for the Subsidiaries listed on the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company has no Subsidiaries, owns no capital stock or other proprietary
interest, directly or indirectly, in any other corporation, association,
trust, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other entity
and has no agreement with any person, firm or corporation to acquire any such
capital stock or other proprietary interest. The Company has full power,
authority and legal right, and all necessary approvals, Permits (as defined
below), Licenses (as defined below) and authorizations to own its properties
and to conduct the Business; except where the failure to have such approvals,
Permits, Licenses or authorizations would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The copies of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Company and each of the Subsidiaries ("Charter Documents") and minute books
and stock ledgers of the Company and the Subsidiaries, all of which have been
made available to Purchaser, are complete and correct in all material
respects (except for the stock ledgers that are complete and correct in all
respects), and neither the Company nor any Subsidiaries are in violation of
any Charter Documents. As used in this Agreement, a "Subsidiary" of the
Company is an entity, whether incorporated or unincorporated, (i) in which
the Company owns, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of
the securities or other ownership interests having by their terms ordinary
voting power to elect more than fifty percent (50%) of the directors or other
persons performing similar functions, (ii) in which the Company (or an entity
which is otherwise a Subsidiary of the Company) is a general partner,
managing member or has similar authority or (iii) the management of the
entity in question which the Company (or an entity which is otherwise a
Subsidiary of the Company) has the power to direct. Other than the definition
of "Company Material Adverse Change" and "Company Material Adverse Effect" in
the following sentence, for purposes of this Section 3.1 only, all references
to the Company shall be deemed to be references to the Company only and not
the Subsidiaries. "Company Material Adverse Change" or "Company
Material Adverse Effect," as the case may be, shall mean any change, effect,
event or condition occurring on or prior to November 21, 2004 (i) which,
individually or in the aggregate, has had a material adverse effect on the
business, results of operations or financial condition or assets of the
Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) that could  
7  reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the Company\'s
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; provided,
however, that, in no event will any of the following, alone or in
combination, constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Company
Material Adverse Change: (a) a change in the trading prices of any of the
Company\'s securities, in and of itself; (b) general economic, political and
financial market changes and the effects, changes, events, circumstances and
conditions resulting therefrom, to the extent not having a materially
disproportionate impact on the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole
than the effect on similarly situated companies; (c) reductions in regulatory
reimbursement rates affecting the Company taking effect after the Effective
Time and the effects, changes, events, circumstances and conditions resulting
therefrom, to the extent not having a materially disproportionate impact on
the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole than the effect on
similarly situated companies; (d) any effects, changes, events, circumstances
or conditions resulting from the announcement or pendency of any of the
transactions provided for in this Agreement; (e) any effects, changes,
events, circumstances or conditions resulting from compliance by
the Purchaser or the Company with the terms of, or the taking of any
action specifically required to be taken in, this Agreement; and (f) the
effect of any matters specifically disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or in the Company SEC Filings (as defined below) as filed or amended
through the date hereof, excluding any disclosures set forth under captions
entitled "Risk Factors," and "Forward-looking Statements" unless the same
information is appropriately set forth on the Company Disclosure
Statement.   Section 3.2 Authority. (a) The Company has the full legal

Agreement (other than, with respect to the consummation of the Merger, the
approval and adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company in

contemplated hereby.   (c) The Company has no knowledge of any state anti-

and will not permit any Subsidiary (to the extent consistent with the
Company\'s fiduciary obligations to holders of minority interests in
any Subsidiary) to:   (i) adopt or propose any change in the Company\'s
articles of incorporation or in the case of the Company\'s by laws, adopt or
propose any change which would have a Company Material Adverse Effect (for
purposes of this clause (i), even if such event resulting in a Company

Access to Information. (a) Subject to the applicable Legal Requirements and
contractual restrictions imposing confidentiality or non-disclosure
obligations or restrictions, the Company and each Subsidiary will permit
Purchaser and its attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, and
other professional advisors and representatives to have reasonable access
prior to the Effective Time to the Facilities, offices, properties and to the
books and records (including, without limitation, contracts, documents and
Tax records) of the Company and each Subsidiary and personnel at the Company
and each Subsidiary, during normal working hours and upon reasonable notice,
to familiarize itself with the Company\'s and each Subsidiary\'s
respective Facilities, properties, business, operating and financial
condition and to conduct any and all financial, legal, regulatory, business
and other due diligence procedures as Purchaser or its representatives may
reasonably deem appropriate for any purpose germane to this Agreement and in
connection with a Subsequent Transaction (as defined below); provided,
however, that Purchaser and its representatives shall take reasonable steps
to avoid disruption of the normal operations of the Company or any
Subsidiary.   (b) Purchaser hereby acknowledges that it is subject to
the Confidentiality Agreement dated March 30, 2004 with the Company (as
amended from time to time), which sets forth certain obligations regarding
confidential treatment of certain information of the Company and each of the
Subsidiaries (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), and Purchaser hereby confirms
that the Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and
its Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) will
continue to comply with the terms, conditions and restrictions thereunder,
and that any and all Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) obtained during any review of the Company or any Subsidiary
contemplated by this Agreement will be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement (unless specifically exempted from the restrictions
of such Confidentiality Agreement by the terms and conditions thereof),
provided, however, that such Evaluation Material may be provided to
counterparties to Subsequent Transactions (as defined below) and the
Representatives of such counterparties, subject to their being bound by
confidentiality agreements containing terms and conditions   
37   substantially similar to those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and specifically designating the Company as a third party
beneficiary thereto.   Section 5.3 Notices of Certain Events. The Company
shall promptly notify Purchaser of:   (a) any notice or other communication
from any Person alleging that the consent or approval of such Person (or
another Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and such consent or approval is material;  
(b) any notice or other communication, which is material, from
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement;   (c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to the its knowledge, threatened against, relating
to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
which, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
have been disclosed pursuant to the terms hereof or which relate to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;   (d) the
occurrence, to Company\'s Knowledge, of any event that has had a Company
Material Adverse Change (for this purpose, even if such event occurs on or
after November 21, 2004);   (e) the occurrence of any event or the discovery
of any information which would cause any representation or warranty of the
Company, or any information set forth on the Company Disclosure Schedule, to
be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect;   (f) the occurrence of
any event or the discovery of any information which would delay in any
material respect, or render impossible, the performance by the Company of its
obligations under this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby;   (g) any written notice of default received with
respect to a Lease or other Material Contract; and   (h) any notice of
claim by any Governmental Authority with respect to the actual suspension,
revocation or termination of any License, Permit or CON or the exclusion,
disqualification or debarment of the Company or any Subsidiary from any Third
Party Payor Program.   Section 5.4 Certain Filings; Stockholders Meeting;
Takeover Statutes. (a) The Company\'s Board (i) shall recommend to the
stockholders of the Company that such stockholders approve the Merger,
approve and adopt this Agreement, and approve the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit and obtain such approvals and adoption by holders of a
majority of the outstanding Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company\'s Board may fail to comply with clauses (i) or (ii) hereinabove and
may withdraw, modify or change such recommendation of the Merger, this
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement if it has
determined in    38   good faith, based on such matters as they deem
relevant and after receiving advice from outside legal counsel, that the
failure to withdraw, modify or change its recommendation of the Merger, this
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of the directors\' fiduciary duties
under applicable law. Unless this Agreement has previously been terminated
pursuant to Section 9.1, whether or not the Company\'s Board has made a
recommendation, or has withdrawn, modified or changed in any manner adverse
to the interests of Purchaser, its recommendation of the Merger, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company
shall take all steps necessary (including, without limitation, the
preparation (as promptly hereafter as practicable) and filing with the SEC
(as promptly as practicable following receipt from Purchaser of the Debt
Commitment Letter as defined below) of a proxy statement with respect thereto
(the "Proxy Statement"), to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders Meeting")) for
the purpose of approving the Merger, approving and adopting this Agreement
and approving the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and for such
other purposes as may be deemed necessary by the Company in connection
with effectuating the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, however, that in any event, the Company shall file
with the SEC the Proxy Statement, and mail the Proxy Statement and convene
the Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practical following receipt
from Purchaser of the Debt Commitment Letter. Purchaser shall be given
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement,
including all amendments and supplements thereto, prior to the filing thereof
with the SEC. The Company agrees to provide Purchaser and Purchaser\'s
counsel copies of any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after
receipt of such comments. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to respond to such comments promptly and shall provide Purchaser and
Purchaser\'s counsel with copies of any written responses by the Company or
its counsel.   (b) If any state or federal takeover statute is or may
become applicable to the Merger, this Agreement, or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub and
their respective Boards of Directors, subject to compliance by their Board of
Directors\' with their fiduciary duties, will grant such approvals and will
take such other actions as are necessary so that this Agreement and the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and,
subject to compliance with such Board of Directors\' fiduciary duties, will
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any state or federal
takeover statute on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   (c) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
Purchaser or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand,
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement, at the
date such Proxy Statement is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and
at the time of the Stockholders\' Meeting, will contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at any time prior
to the date of the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein
should the Company or Purchaser discover information relating to the Company
or Purchaser, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors,
which should be set forth in an amendment and/or a supplement to the Proxy
Statement, the Company and    39   Purchaser shall take all appropriate
action so that the Proxy Statement would not, at the date of mailing of the
Proxy Statement to stockholders and at the time of the Company stockholder
meeting, include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The party discovering such information shall promptly
notify the other party and, to the extent required by Legal Requirements, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing that information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC or any other applicable Governmental Authority
and, to the extent required by Legal Requirements, disseminated to the
Company\'s stockholders.   Section 5.5 Options. No options or warrants for
Common Stock shall be granted, amended or modified, except as contemplated in
Section 1.3 and except that options to purchase common stock under the 2002
Plan set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule up to the limits set forth
in the 2002 Plan may be granted in the ordinary course of business to
employees who are not senior executives of the Company or any Subsidiary, and
up to 7,500 shares of restricted common stock may be granted to each of two
new directors who may fill vacancies on the Company\'s Board (collectively,
"Permitted Awards").   Section 5.6 Retention Plan. The Company shall
implement the program set forth in Schedule 5.6 to the Company Disclosure
Schedule (which Schedule 5.6 has been mutually approved by Purchaser and the
Company) providing for selected personnel of the Company identified by the
Company\'s Chief Executive Officer with a compensation program and budget for
their retention by the Company and continued employment from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time and thereafter (in the discretion of the
Surviving Corporation) to assist in the implementation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger and the transition of management and ownership as
contemplated by the Merger (collectively, the "Retention Plan"). The Company
shall be permitted to incur the budgeted expenses under the Retention Plan,
and to enter into appropriate documentation (subject to the reasonable
approval of Purchaser) with the covered personnel setting forth the amount to
be paid to each identified individual pursuant to the Retention Plan and the
other relevant terms relating thereto.   Section 5.7 Financial Reports and
Taxes. No later than twenty-five days after the end of each month commencing
with May 2004 and continuing through the later of the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser
unaudited financial statements (without footnotes) as at the end of such
month, including balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of
cash flows, which shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice
(collectively, the "Monthly Financials"), which Monthly Financials shall in
the case of each month which is the end of a fiscal quarter of the Company be
prepared also on a quarterly basis. The Monthly Financials shall be subject
to the Confidentiality Agreement. From the date hereof through the Effective
Time, the Company shall comply with its obligations as to Taxes and Tax
Returns in the same manner as required in Section 3.11 as to periods prior to
the date hereof.   Section 5.8 Cooperation as to Real Property Matters. The
Company shall make available to Purchaser or its designees all appraisals,
valuations, engineering reports, environmental studies and reports,
architectural plans and drawings and other reports and analysis relating to
the Real Property which may be in the possession of the Company or the   
40   Subsidiaries. The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to
satisfy and remove from record all Encumbrances on or with respect to the
Real Property or any part thereof as Purchaser may request, including but not
limited to, Permitted Encumbrances listed on Exhibit B to the title indemnity
agreement provided to Fidelity National Title Insurance Company in connection
with the Company\'s December 2003 financing, and (by bonding or otherwise)
all mechanics and materialmen liens (notwithstanding that some or all of such
Encumbrances may be included within Permitted Encumbrances for the purposes
of the representations in this Agreement); provided, however, that the
failure to remove any Permitted Encumbrance, despite the Company\'s use of
commercially reasonable efforts, shall not, in and of itself, be a condition
to Purchaser\'s obligations under this Agreement.   Section 5.9 No
Solicitations. (a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time or such
earlier date as this Agreement shall terminate in accordance with its terms,
neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly
(i) solicit, knowingly encourage or initiate discussion or inquiries with or
(ii) enter into negotiations or agreements with, or furnish any information
that is not publicly available to, any corporation, partnership, company,
Person or other entity or group (other than Purchaser, an affiliate
of Purchaser or their authorized representatives) concerning, or take any
other action to facilitate, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), and
the Company and the Subsidiaries will instruct their officers, directors
and advisors and financial and legal representatives and consultants
(collectively, the "Company Representatives") not to take any action contrary
to, or inconsistent with, the foregoing provisions of this sentence. The
Company and the Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause the Company
Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate all existing activities,
discussions and negotiations with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and the Company Representatives
shall not be prohibited from (x) complying with its disclosure obligations
under Sections 14d-9 and 14e-2 of the Exchange Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, or (y) engaging in any activities described in clause
(ii) above (or entering into an agreement resulting from such activities), in
response to an inquiry, proposal or offer from a third party if such action
is taken by, or upon the authority of, the Company\'s Board after the Board
determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that
such action is necessary in order for its directors to comply with their
respective fiduciary duties under applicable law. The Company will notify
Purchaser within 72 hours if any inquiries or proposals are received by, any
information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought
to be initiated with, the Company, the Subsidiaries or the Company
Representatives with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. An "Acquisition
Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than
Purchaser or an affiliate of Purchaser) relating to (1) any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of a business or assets, or assets of the
Company or the Subsidiaries that constitutes thirty percent (30%) or more of
the net revenues or assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of Shares that would
result in a Person or group owning thirty percent (30%) or more of the Shares
or voting power (or of securities or rights convertible into or exercisable
for such Shares or voting power) of the Company, (2) any tender offer or
exchange offer or other acquisition or series of acquisitions of Shares that,
if consummated, would result in any Person or group beneficially
owning thirty percent (30%) or more of the Shares or voting power (or of
securities or rights convertible into or exercisable for such Shares or
voting power) of the Company, or (3) any merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of the Subsidiaries that constitutes
thirty    41   percent (30%) or more of the net revenues or assets of
the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in each case other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the transactions
referred to in the foregoing definition of Acquisition Proposal, other than
the Merger, is referred to herein as an "Acquisition Transaction."   (b)
Each time, if any, that the Company\'s Board determines, in accordance with
the previous paragraph, that it must enter into negotiations with, or furnish
any information that is not publicly available to, any Person (other than
Purchaser, an affiliate of Purchaser or their authorized representatives)
concerning any Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall (i) give Purchaser
prompt notice of such determination; and (ii) promptly provide Purchaser with
a summary of the material terms of any Acquisition Proposal and of any
material negotiations or communications between the Company or
the Subsidiaries or any of the Company Representatives and any Person (other
than Purchaser or its representatives) concerning any Acquisition Proposal.
Prior to the Company\'s Board or the Company accepting an Acquisition
Proposal or, in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, prior to
withdrawing, modifying or changing in a manner adverse to Purchaser or Merger
Sub the approval or recommendation of the Company\'s Board of the Merger and
this Agreement, the Company shall give Purchaser notice of the Company\'s
Board or the Company\'s intention to accept such Acquisition Proposal or to
withdraw, modify or change the approval or recommendation of the Company\'s
Board, which notice shall include the identity of the person making such
Acquisition Proposal and the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, and
a right, during a period of at least five (5) business days from Purchaser\'s
receipt of such notice (except that such period shall be at least ten (10)
business days if such notice is given within sixty (60) days after the date
of this Agreement) to submit a revised proposal containing terms and
conditions as Purchaser deems appropriate (except that in no event may
Purchaser submit a revised proposal with a purchase price per Share less than
the Stock Price) and if the Company\'s Board, in the reasonable exercise of
its fiduciary duties based on such matters as the Company\'s Board may deem
relevant and after receiving advice from outside legal counsel, determines
that Purchaser\'s revised proposal is no less favorable to the Company or its
stockholders than the terms and conditions in such Acquisition Proposal, then
this Agreement shall be modified to reflect Purchaser\'s revised proposal and
this Agreement shall otherwise continue in full force and effect; provided,
however, that Purchaser shall not relinquish any rights nor be relieved of
any obligations arising under this Agreement as a result of submitting any
revised proposal, and provided further, that nothing herein shall preclude
Purchaser from terminating this Agreement to extent entitled to do so
pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof.   Section 5.10 Bankruptcy Matters. From the
date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company will continue to perform in
all material respects its obligations under the Company Plan of
Reorganization and the Bankruptcy Orders.   Section 5.11 Restricted
Agreements. The Company is party to certain agreements that are subject to
confidentiality or non-disclosure obligations or restrictions ("Restricted
Agreements") which have not been made available to the Purchaser. With
respect to the Restricted Agreements that, in the Company\'s reasonable
belief are material the Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable
best efforts to make the Restricted Agreement or a summary thereof available
to Purchaser for inspection and review.    42    ARTICLE VI  COVENANTS
OF PURCHASER   Section 6.1 Conduct of the Purchaser. Purchaser agrees that
it will take all commercially reasonable best efforts necessary to cause
Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.  
Section 6.2 Notices of Certain Events. The Purchaser shall promptly
notify the Company of:   (a) any notice or other communication from any
Person alleging that the consent or approval of such Person (or another
Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (if such consent or approval is material);  
(b) any notice or other communication (which is material) from
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement;   (c) the occurrence of any event or the discovery of
any information which would cause any representation or warranty of the
Purchaser to be untrue or inaccurate;   (d) the occurrence of any event or
the discovery of any information which would delay in any material respect,
or render impossible, the performance by the Purchaser of its obligations
under this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; and   (e) any material adverse change in the Structural Assumptions
set forth on the Financing Schedule that Purchaser intends to obtain or
implement to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby
(provided, however, that the content of such notice shall not, in and of
itself, give the Company any right to terminate this Agreement prior to the
End Date, but this proviso shall not modify the representations, warranties
and covenants made by the Purchaser in Section 4.7 and Section 6.3 hereof or
in any way effect the Company\'s ability to draw on the LC (as defined below)
in accordance with Section 9.2(c) below).   Section 6.3 Purchaser
Financing. At the Closing, Purchaser will have sufficient cash available to
it to pay the Aggregate Purchase Price and Change of Control Payments that
will be due and payable at the Closing. Purchaser shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to obtain and implement all necessary financing and
Structural Assumptions set forth in the Financing Schedule with such changes
as Purchaser may desire, in order to have available to it the Aggregate
Purchase Price and such Change of Control Payments at or prior to the
Closing; provided, however, that in no event will Purchaser make any changes
in the Structural Assumptions that would be reasonably expected to have a
material adverse effect on the solvency of the Company upon the consummation
of the Merger, the Subsequent Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated herein, provided further, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, so long as Purchaser obtains and tenders to the Company the
Aggregate Purchase Price and such Change of Control Payments on or prior to
the End Date, Purchaser shall not be    43   in breach of this covenant.
In connection with the foregoing, Purchaser is seeking, from one or more
reputable financial institutions, a financing commitment for the transactions
contemplated hereby containing customary terms for financing transactions of
a similar size and nature to the transaction contemplated herein (the "Debt
Commitment Letter"), predicated on Purchaser\'s commitment to provide the
Equity Commitment. Purchaser has requested a reputable investment banking
organization to issue a Debt Commitment Letter within forty (40) days after
the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to obtain the
Debt Commitment Letter shall not, in and of itself, be a breach of this
Agreement by Purchaser and shall not, in and of itself, give the Company any
right to terminate this Agreement or to exercise any other remedy prior
to the End Date. No later than the later of (a) three business days prior to
the date initially scheduled for the Company Stockholders Meeting and (b)
eight (8) days prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to, or make
available for review by, the Company copies of the definitive documentation
required to implement each of the Structural Assumptions (collectively, the
"Structural Documents") and thereafter through the Effective Time Purchaser
shall not make any material changes or supplements to or waivers of any
provisions of the Structural Assumptions or Structural Documents.   Section
6.4 Director and Officer Liability.   (a) Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation shall jointly and severally, from and after the Effective Time,
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
the Company, determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties"),
in respect of acts or omissions in their capacity as such, against any costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, "Costs") incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
to the fullest extent permitted by Law (and Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation shall jointly and severally advance expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted by Law); provided, that any determination required
to be made with respect to whether an officer or director is entitled to
indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be made by independent
counsel selected by Purchaser and such Person.   (b) The Company shall
purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy prior to the Effective Time on
terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the
existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the
Company and which shall include first dollar coverage or such other level of
self-insured retention as may be reasonably obtained; provided, that the
amount paid by the Company shall not exceed six times the current annual
premium paid by the Company for the Company\'s existing officers\' and
directors\' liability insurance. If such "tail" prepaid policies have been
obtained by the Company prior to the Closing, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such
policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the respective
obligations thereunder.   (c) The obligations of Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 6.4 shall not be terminated or modified by
Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation in a    44   manner as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section applies without
the consent of the affected Indemnified Party. In the event that
either Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Persons,
or (ii) transfers at least 50% of its properties or assets to any Person,
then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the applicable
successors and assigns or transferees assume the obligations set forth in
this Section.   (d) The provisions of this Section 6.4 are intended to be
for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his
or her heirs and his or her representatives and are in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such person may have by contract or otherwise, all of which shall remain
in effect for a period of at least six years.   Section 6.5 Employee
Policies. For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall not make any general
across the board adverse change in compensation, health and welfare benefits,
bonus plans or vacation and leave plans, affecting employees of the Company
or its Subsidiaries employed at the Effective Time; provided, however, that
in the event the cost of health and welfare benefits incurred by the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) increases by
more than 15% (a "Material Benefit Cost Increase"), the Surviving Corporation
may take such action as may be reasonably necessary (such as increasing co-
payment obligations or deductible thresholds) to limit the increase in the
cost of health and welfare benefits to a level that does not constitute a
Material Benefit Cost Increase. The Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries shall maintain the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\'
respective severance payment policies that are in effect on the date hereof,
for a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, with respect
to each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries employed at the Effective
Time.   Section 6.6 Bankruptcy Matters. Following the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation will complete all distributions and administer all
claims as and when required by the Company Plan of Reorganization.  
Section 6.7 Solvency of the Surviving Corporation. Purchaser shall furnish or
cause to be furnished to the Company\'s Board copies of any solvency
opinions or similar materials obtained from third parties in connection with
the financing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Subsequent Transactions, to the extent contractually permitted by the issuer
of such opinion. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to
cause the firms issuing any such solvency opinions to allow the Company\'s
Board to rely thereon; provided that no material fee or expense is associated
with obtaining such reliance unless the Company agrees to reimburse Purchaser
for any such fees or expenses. Following the Effective Time and until the
earlier to occur of six (6) years thereafter or the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitation, Purchaser shall not take or fail to take
any action that if such action had been deemed to have been taken or such
failure to act had been deemed to have occurred immediately prior to the
Effective Time would have caused the representations and warranties set forth
in Section 4.10 hereof to be untrue as of the Effective Time. The provisions
of this Section 6.7 are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each holder of Shares and their respective successors, heirs
and personal representatives.    45    ARTICLE VII  COVENANTS OF
PURCHASER AND THE COMPANY   The parties hereto agree that:   Section 7.1
Commercially Reasonable Best Efforts; HSR Matters.   (a) Each of the parties
hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other party hereto in doing, all things reasonably
necessary, proper, or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, without limitation (i) the obtaining of all necessary
waivers, consents, Licenses and Permits, and approvals from Governmental
Authorities, making of all necessary registrations and filings, and the
taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain any approval
or waiver from, or to avoid any action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Authority, (ii) obtaining all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from any Persons other than Governmental Authorities, such as
landlords and lenders, (iii) assisting Purchaser in its obtaining the debt
financing contemplated by Section 4.7 hereof and (iv) defending any lawsuits
or any other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including without limitation, seeking to have any
temporary restraining order or injunction entered into by any court or
administrative authority vacated or reserved; provided that nothing in this
Section 7.1(a) shall require any party hereto to waive any condition set
forth in Article VIII or limit the Company\'s and Subsidiary\'s rights under
Section 5.9   (b) Without limiting the generality of Section 7.1(a) hereof,
the parties shall, as promptly as practicable, prepare and file any
notifications required under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties shall respond as promptly as practicable to
(i) any inquiries or requests received from the Federal Trade Commission or
the Department of Justice for additional information or documentation and
(ii) any inquiries or requests received from any state attorney general,
foreign antirust authority or other Governmental Authority in connection with
antitrust or related matters. Each party shall (1) give the other party
prompt notice of the commencement or threat of commencement of any legal
proceeding by or before any court or Governmental Authority with respect to
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(2) keep the other party informed as to the status of any such legal
proceeding or threat, and (3) promptly inform the other party of any
communication to or from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of
Justice or any other Governmental Authority regarding the Merger. Except as
may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by any Legal Requirement,
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will consult
and cooperate with one another, and will consider in good faith the views of
one another, in connection with any analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or
submitted in connection with any legal proceeding under or relating to the
HSR Act. Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, will
permit authorized representatives of the other party to be present at each
meeting or conference relating to any such legal proceeding and to have
access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or
proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Authority in connection with
any such legal proceeding. Nothing herein shall be deemed to   
46   require Purchaser or its affiliates to agree to divest, sell, dispose
of, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits
its freedom of action with respect to it or any of its affiliates\' ability
to retain, any of its businesses, properties or assets, as they exist at this
time, if any such action would result in a material adverse effect on the
results of operations, financial conditions of the Purchaser and its
affiliates and the Company taken as a whole or Purchaser\'s ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Furthermore, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall agree to divest, sell, dispose of,
hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its
freedom of action with respect to it or any of its affiliates\' ability to
retain, any of its businesses, property or assets, without the prior written
consent of Purchaser, if such action would result in a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.   Section 7.2 Public Disclosure. The parties shall
cooperate in the Company\'s preparation and prompt issuance of a mutually
acceptable press release announcing the execution of this Agreement and
filing of a Current Report on Form 8 - K with the SEC including as an exhibit
thereto a copy of this Agreement and any other ancillary document or
agreement that is material to the transactions contemplated hereby.
Thereafter, as long as this Agreement is in effect, except to the extent
required by applicable Legal Requirements, neither the Company nor Purchaser
shall issue any press release or public announcements or make any public
filings of any kind concerning the Merger or other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other, and in the
event any such public announcement, release or disclosure is required by
applicable Legal Requirements, the parties will consult prior to making
thereof and use their commercially reasonable best efforts to agree upon a
mutual satisfactory text.   Section 7.3 Further Assurances. (a) Purchaser
and the Company shall execute and deliver such certificates and other
documents and take such other actions as may reasonably be requested by the
other party in order to consummate or implement the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 7.3 shall require any
party hereto to waive any condition set forth in Article VIII or limit the
Company\'s and Subsidiary\'s rights under Section 5.9.   (b) The Company
shall, to the extent compatible with fulfilling the conditions to the
consummation of this Agreement, and its other obligations under this
Agreement cooperate, and cause its Subsidiaries to cooperate, with Purchaser
in the provision of due diligence information with respect to transactions
with respect to, Facilities, operations, businesses or assets of the Company
or the Subsidiaries which Purchaser may desire to implement on or after the
Effective Time ("Subsequent Transactions"), including, without limitation,
providing assistance in obtaining regulatory approvals from Governmental
Authorities and Accreditation Bodies, consents, access agreements, lien
waivers, estoppel certificates, subordination, non-disturbance,
attornment, similar agreements from third parties; provided, however, that no
Subsequent Transaction or the closing thereof shall be a condition to the
obligations of Purchaser or the Company under Article VIII of this Agreement;
and, provided, further, however, that for purposes of this Section 7.3, the
Company shall not be required, in connection with such cooperation, to breach
any agreement to which it is a party or subject, incur any costs or expenses
to third parties unless Purchaser shall advance any costs or expenses
therefor, or enter into any agreement or undertake any obligation with
respect thereto unless such agreement or obligation is subject to the Closing
and does not become effective until on or after    47   the Effective
Time. The provision of due diligence and other information regarding the
Company to counterparties to Subsequent Transactions shall be subject to the
confidentiality requirements of Section 5.2(b) above. Further, while
Purchaser may file and pursue applications for consents and approvals
with Governmental Authorities, including with respect to Licenses, in
connection with Subsequent Transactions, Purchaser will not take any such
actions that could impair, or result in any change of ownership status prior
to the Effective Time with respect to any Licenses held by the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate in the provision of
such information as may be reasonably requested by Houlihan Lokey in
connection with the preparation and rendering of the Bring Down Opinion (as
defined below).   (c) The Company shall cooperate and cause the Subsidiaries
to cooperate, with the Purchaser, and shall take all reasonable actions in
the name of the Company or the Subsidiaries, at the request of the Purchaser,
to apply for and attempt to obtain additional Bankruptcy Orders and/or to
enforce the terms and conditions of the Company Plan of Reorganization and
existing Bankruptcy Orders so as to remove Encumbrances and extinguish pre-
petition liability and obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, to the
fullest extent permitted or required by the Company Plan of Reorganization,
Bankruptcy Orders and applicable bankruptcy laws.   (d) The Company shall
cooperate, and cause the Subsidiaries to cooperate with the Purchaser, in the
negotiation, documentation and closing of the satisfaction, payoff,
defeasance, refinancing or restructuring of any debt obligations of the
Company which Purchaser may desire to implement on or after the Effective
Time and the removal of Encumbrances in connection therewith (collectively,
"Debt Satisfaction"), provided, however, that the Company shall not be
required to enter into any agreement, or amend or modify any
existing agreement, or incur any obligation, to effectuate such Debt
Satisfaction unless such agreement, amendment, modification or obligation is
subject to the Closing and does not become effective until on or after the
Effective Time, and shall not be required to pay (other than
contemporaneously with the Effective Time in amounts and with funding
arranged and provided by the Purchaser) any amounts to holders of debt
obligations of the Company to effectuate such Debt Satisfaction.   (e)
Purchaser shall, as promptly as practicable hereafter, prepare and submit all
necessary applications for Governmental Authority consents or approvals,
Licenses and Permits with respect to Purchaser\'s obtaining control and
ownership of the Company, and Purchaser shall diligently prosecute
such applications to completion. The Company shall, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries to, cooperate with Purchaser in the preparation and
prosecution of such applications including, without limitation, providing
such information and executing such documents required to be submitted in
connection with such applications. Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary Governmental Authority
consents and approvals, Licenses and Permits in connection with the Merger.
The Company shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to implement, if
feasible, an Alternative Structure (as defined herein) where necessary.  
(f) Subject to applicable Legal Requirements and contractual restrictions
imposing confidentiality or non-disclosure obligations or restrictions, the
Company shall cooperate and cause the Subsidiaries to cooperate, with the
Purchaser upon Purchaser\'s    48   reasonable request, in (i) supplying
to Purchaser\'s lender or lenders all agreements, documents, instruments,
reports, financial information and statements, and other information
regarding the Company and the Subsidiaries, the Real Property, the Business
and the other activities of or related to any of the foregoing, and (ii)
attempting to respond to questions raised by Purchaser\'s lender; provided,
however, that (1) failure of Purchaser to obtain its financing despite the
Company\'s cooperation, shall not be a condition to Purchaser\'s obligations
under this Agreement and (2) the Company shall not be required, in connection
with such cooperation, to incur any costs or expenses to third parties unless
Purchaser shall advance any costs or expenses therefor or to enter into any
agreements, commitments or other arrangements that are binding until
immediately after the Effective Time.   ARTICLE VIII  CONDITIONS TO THE

statute, rule, regulation or executive or any other order or similar action
of any Governmental Authority enacted or issued, which would render the
parties unable to consummate the Merger or make the Merger illegal or
prohibit, restrict or delay consummation of the Merger (other than a de
minimus civil violation of any Legal Requirement that does not affect the
ability of the Surviving Corporation, the Purchaser or their affiliates to
obtain and maintain Licenses for the ownership and operation of health care
facilities or participation in any Program or Third Party Payor Program);
and   (d) There shall not have been instituted any action or
proceeding before any court or administrative agency, by any Governmental
Authority or any other person, challenging or otherwise relating to the
Merger.   (e) The consummation of the Merger shall not result in the
violation of any Legal Requirement (other than de minimus civil violation of
any Legal Requirement that does not affect the ability of the Surviving
Corporation, the Purchaser or their affiliates to obtain and maintain
Licenses for the ownership and operation of health care facilities or
participation in any Program or Third Party Payor Program).   Section 8.2
Conditions to the Obligations of Purchaser and Merger Sub. The obligations of

true and correct when made and shall be true and correct in all material
respects as of the Effective Time (other than those qualified by materiality
or Company Material Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse Change (which
qualifications shall be disregarded for purposes of determining compliance
with the condition set forth in this Section 8.2(a)), which shall be true and
correct in all respects), with the same force and effect as if made as of the
Effective Time, other than such representations and warranties as are made as
of another date (which shall be true and correct as of such other
date), provided that the foregoing condition shall be deemed satisfied so
long as any failures of such representations and warranties to be true and
correct as of the Effective Time, taken together, has not had, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect which causes a
reduction in value of the Company of at least $100 million; provided,
however, that (i) any amounts that could be included in the calculations made
pursuant Sections 8.2(c)(i) and 8.2(c)(ii) below shall not be included in the
calculation of a reduction in value caused by a Company Material Adverse
Effect, (ii) the amount of any insurance proceeds that are reasonably
expected to be available (based on the Company\'s good faith substantiation
thereof including applicable insurance policies then in effect) shall be
applied to offset any decrease in value occasioned by any particular change,
event, effect as condition to the extent of any such insurance proceeds and
(iii) any reduction in the amount of available net operating losses
("NOLs") from the amount of NOLs reported in the Company\'s financial
statements dated March 31, 2004 shall not constitute a Company Material
Adverse Change and will not be included in any calculation of a reduction in
value related to a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material
Adverse Change. For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly acknowledged and
agreed that the changes, events, effects or conditions included in the
calculation set forth in this Section 8.2(a) are wholly independent from the
amounts associated with any changes, events, effects or conditions included
in the calculations to be made pursuant to Sections 8.2(c)(i) and 8.2(c)(ii).
At the Effective Time, the Company shall have delivered to Purchaser and

Such certificate shall attach an update of the Company Disclosure Schedule as
of the Effective Time, subject to Section 10.12 hereof.   (b) Each of the
covenants and agreements of the Company to be performed or complied with by
the Company at or prior to the Effective Time shall have been performed or
complied with in all material respects and, at the Effective Time, the
Company shall have delivered to Purchaser and Merger Sub a certificate dated
the date of the Effective Time to such effect.   (c) That none of the
following events shall have occurred:   (i) (x) any one or more of the

set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule affecting title to or use of
Owned Real Property that materially impair the use or occupancy of such real
property in the operation of the Business and the operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries conducted thereon or contain any right of reversion or
reverter with respect to (1) Owned Real Property or, (2) Leased Real Property
or Managed Real Property that is linked to an Owned Real Property by way of a
managed care agreement, income or patient sharing arrangement, referral
arrangement or other similar arrangement or agreement (such leased or managed
property, a "Linked    50   Property") causes the Purchaser\'s lender to
reduce the loan amount by at least $50,000,000 in the aggregate;   (ii) any
one or more violations of any Land Use Requirement or Environmental Laws with
respect to Owned Real Property and/or Linked Property, that causes the
Purchaser\'s lender to reduce the loan amount and such reduction, together
with any reduction determined under Section 8.2(c)(i), aggregates at least
$75,000,000. The term "Land Use Requirement" shall mean zoning, building code
and other land use Legal Requirements regulating the use or occupancy of any
real property or the activities conducted thereon that are imposed by
any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over such real property but
shall exclude any amounts attributable to deferred maintenance or capital
expenditures unless the subject thereof, if not remediated, would constitute
a violation of any Land Use Requirement or Environmental Law; or   (iii) if
Purchaser has complied with its obligations arising pursuant to the last
sentence of Section 7.3(b), failure to obtain, primarily as a result of
actions taken directly by the Company which shall constitute a breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant by the Company, any necessary License
required in order to make consummation of the Merger not in violation of any
applicable Legal Requirements and in connection therewith a failure
to implement, in compliance with Legal Requirements, an "Alternative
Structure". The term "Alternative Structure" shall mean the use of a
management agreement, identity of interest transaction, retention of
ownership in a liquidating trust for the benefit of the Company\'s
stockholders or other structure for the purpose of allowing Purchaser to
obtain the desired financial benefits from a skilled nursing facility or
long-term acute care facility or group of such facilities until the required
License(s) are obtained, in each case which can be implemented in compliance
with Legal Requirements and is reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and the
Company;   (d) Purchaser shall have received a copy of the resolutions of
the Company\'s Board authorizing this Agreement and the Merger and of
the stockholders of the Company approving the Merger, approving and adopting
this Agreement and approving the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(other than the Subsequent Transactions), which copy shall be certified by an
officer of the Company as being in full force and effect;   (e) The holders
of no more than ten percent (10%) of the Shares (other than Shares
beneficially owned, directly or indirectly by Purchaser or any Person acting
in concert with Purchaser) shall have perfected appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the GCL;   (f) The parties shall have obtained all necessary
third party and Governmental Authority consents and approvals to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, applicable
lessors and lenders to the Company; provided, however, (i) that it is
understood and expressly agreed that the parties will deem that all such
necessary third party and Governmental Authority consents and approvals have
been obtained if the consents and approvals obtained are subject only to
conditions customarily imposed by the applicable regulatory authorities in
transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) the
consents and approvals obtained are sufficient, if upon consummation of the
transactions    51   contemplated by this Agreement the Company will not
reasonably be expected to experience a Company Material Adverse Effect.  
(g) There shall not have occurred a general suspension of, or limitation on
prices for, trading in securities on any national securities exchange or the
over-the-counter market in the United States (other than a shortening of
trading hours or any coordinated trading halt triggered solely as a result of
a specified increase or decrease in a market index) or a declaration of a
banking moratorium or any material suspension of payments in respect of banks
in the United States or any material limitation by any U.S.
Governmental Entity on the extension of credit by banks or other lending
institutions in the United States any of which shall have been in effect for
a continuous period of four (4) business days; provided, however, that, if
any such events shall be in effect on the Closing Date for less than four (4)
business days, Purchaser may postpone the Closing for a sufficient period of
time (not to exceed four (4) business days) to determine the applicability of
this condition.   Section 8.3 Conditions to the Obligations of the Company.
The obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger are subject to the
satisfaction of the following further conditions:   (a) The representations
and warranties made by Purchaser and Merger Sub herein (i) were true and
correct, when made and (ii) shall be true and correct as of the Effective
Time as if made on and as of such date (provided, however, that such
representations and warranties which are by their express provisions made as
of a specific date need be so true and correct only as of such specific
date), except to the extent that any failure of such representations and
warranties to be so true and correct as of the Effective Time would not
prevent or materially delay the ability of Merger Sub or Purchaser to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each of the
covenants and agreements of Purchaser and Merger Sub to be performed or
complied with by Purchaser and Merger Sub at or prior to the Effective
Time shall have been performed or complied with in all material respects and,
at the Effective Time, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall have delivered to the
Company a certificate dated as of the date of the Effective Time to such
effect, confirming the accuracy of the Structural Assumptions and Structural
Documents and the absence of any material changes, supplements or waivers of
any provision thereof, and certifying that the Structural Documents are in
full force and effect;   (b) The Company shall have received a copy of the
resolutions of the Board of Directors of Purchaser and the Board of Directors
of Merger Sub authorizing the Merger, the Agreement, the transactions
contemplated thereby and the Subsequent Transactions to be implemented at the
Effective Time, if any, which copy shall be certified by an executive officer
of Purchaser or Merger Sub, as the case may be as being in full force and
effect;   (c) At the Closing, Purchaser shall have available to it
sufficient monies to enable Purchaser to pay the Aggregate Purchase Price and
the Change of Control Payments, if any, due at the Closing; and   (d) The

Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned
at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding any approval of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company);   (a) by mutual written
consent of the Company, Merger Sub and Purchaser;   (b) by either the
Company or Purchaser, if the Merger has not been consummated on or prior to
December 31, 2004 (the "End Date") (including, without limitation, due to the
failure of any of the conditions to such parties\' obligations as set forth
in Article VIII to be satisfied); provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this clause shall not be available to any
party whose action or failure to act has been the cause of, or resulted in,
the failure of the transaction contemplated hereby to occur on or before such
date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of
this Agreement;   (c) (i) by either the Company or Purchaser, if there
shall be any Legal Requirement (other than failure to obtain Licenses under
the circumstances as set forth in Section 9.1(c)(ii) hereof) that makes
consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or if any
judgment, injunction, order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction
shall permanently restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger, and
such judgment, injunction, order or decree shall become final and non-
appealable; provided, however, that the party terminating this Agreement
pursuant to this clause shall have used its commercially reasonable best
efforts to have such judgment, injunction, order or decree vacated; or (ii)
by the Purchaser in the event of the failure to obtain any necessary License
required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby without being in
violation of any Legal Requirements, if such failure is primarily a result of
actions taken directly by the Company which shall constitute a breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant by the Company, and if such License is
not obtainable, the failure of the Company to implement an Alternative
Structure that is in compliance with Legal Requirements;   (d) by the
Company if there has been a material breach by Purchaser or Merger Sub of any
of their respective representations, warranties or covenants contained in
this Agreement that would cause the condition set forth in Section 8.3(a) not
to be satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable by the End
Date;   (e) by Purchaser, if there has been a material breach by the
Company of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in Section 5.4(a) or
Section 5.9, provided, however, that Purchaser may not terminate this
Agreement based on an allegation that the Company has failed to "promptly"
take relevant actions under Section 5.4(a);   (f) by Purchaser, if any of
the Company\'s representations, warranties or covenants (other than those set
forth in Sections 5.4(a) or 5.9) contained in this Agreement that would cause
the condition set forth in Sections 8.2(a), 8.2(b) or 8.2(c) not to be
satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable by the End Date;   
53    (g) by Purchaser, if the Company\'s Board shall have withdrawn,
or modified or changed, in a manner materially adverse to Purchaser, its
approval or recommendation of the Merger, this Agreement or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or shall have recommended any
Acquisition Proposal (other than the Merger);   (h) by either Purchaser or
the Company if the Company\'s stockholders shall have failed to approve the
Merger, approve and adopt this Agreement and approve the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting (or any
adjournment or postponement thereof);   (i) by the Company in connection
with a Superior Proposal if upon such termination of this Agreement, the
Company promptly (i) enters into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal and (ii) if applicable, pays any Purchaser Break Up Fee and
Expense Reimbursement to Purchaser as provided in Section 9.2 of this
Agreement. For purposes hereof, the term "Superior Proposal" shall mean any
Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of the Company determines,
taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such
proposal, the likelihood of obtaining financing, and the identity of the
Person making the proposal, represents a transaction more favorable to the
Company\'s stockholders than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
which, for the avoidance of doubt, may include a transaction where the
consideration per share to be received by stockholders of the Company has a
lower value than the Stock Price or is comprised of cash and/or
other property or securities;   (j) by Purchaser if more than ten percent
(10%) of the Shares (other than Shares beneficially owned, directly or
indirectly by Purchaser or any Person acting in concert with Purchaser) shall
have perfected appraisal rights under Section 262 of the GCL; or   (k) by
the Company if, on or after the date the Company is entitled to draw upon the

have submitted a Certification for Drawing Letter of Credit, in the form
attached to the LC, to the LC Issuer (as defined below) and the LC Issuer
shall not have honored the requested draw under the LC (without prejudice to
the Company\'s ability to pursue the proceeds of the LC).   Section 9.2

provisions of this Agreement other than Sections 5.2(b) and 9.2 and Article X
shall become null and void and of no force and effect and there shall be no
liability or obligation under this Agreement on the part of Purchaser, Merger
Sub or the Company (other than with respect to the provisions of Sections
5.2(b) and 9.2 and Article X),   (b) Upon termination, the Company shall

Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(e), (B) if the Company shall terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(i) by reason of the Company accepting a
Superior Proposal and the Superior Proposal is a Covered Acquisition
Transaction, or (C) if the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(i) by    54   reason of the Company accepting, within sixty
(60) days after the date of this Agreement, a Superior Proposal that is not a
Covered Acquisition Transaction;   (ii) if Purchaser shall terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(g) and at any time after the date of this

termination, and within nine (9) months of the termination of this Agreement,
the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal which is a Covered Acquisition Transaction; or   (iii) if (A) the
Company or Purchaser shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1(h), (B) the Company\'s Board shall have, at or prior to the Company

nine (9) months of the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into
a definitive agreement with respect to a Covered Acquisition Transaction;  
(c) (i) Purchaser has caused to be delivered to the Company an irrevocable
letter of credit issued by HSBC Bank USA (the "LC Issuer") in the face amount

business on October 20, 2004, Purchaser shall deliver to the Company, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds from a Qualified Source (as
defined below), cash in the amount of $40,000,000 and the Company shall
promptly, but in any event within two (2) business days, return the LC to
Purchaser undrawn for returning to the LC Issuer for cancellation. Such cash
provided by the Purchaser or the proceeds from the LC drawn pursuant to
Section 9.2(c)(iii) are hereinafter referred to as the "LC Proceeds." A
"Qualified Source" shall include (i) Mr. Rubin Schron, provided that at the
request of the Company, Purchaser shall provide an appropriate legal opinion
from Jenkens Gilchrist Parker Chapin LLP, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, that the payment is duly authorized and is not a

approved by the Company in its sole discretion..   (ii) If the Closing shall
have occurred on or prior to October 21, 2004, the Company shall, at the
Closing, deliver the LC to Purchaser undrawn for return to the LC Issuer for
cancellation or the LC Proceeds, as the case may be.   (iii) If the Closing

accordance with the remaining provisions of this Section 9.2(c). If this
Agreement was terminated prior to the close of business on October 21, 2004

Transaction), (h), (i), or (j), the Company shall, within two (2) business
days of such termination, deliver the LC to Purchaser undrawn for return to

Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement required, if any, in connection with such
termination pursuant to Section 9.2(b).   (iv) If the Closing shall occur
at any time after the Company has drawn upon or received the LC Proceeds, the

shall not have occurred on or prior to December 31, 2004 as a result of the
failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in (i) Section 8.2(a), (b) or (c)
that may otherwise be required pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) Section

accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached. Accordingly,

appropriate shall not, in and of itself, constitute a breach of a
representation or warranty of the section from which the reference is
omitted. It is expressly acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall have
the ability to update the Company Disclosure Schedule immediately prior to
the Closing Date so that when the Company\'s representations and warranties
are restated at Closing as required by Section 8.2(a) hereof, such
representations and warranties will be modified by the Company
Disclosure Schedule as so updated immediately prior to the Closing Date;
provided, however, that such updates shall not be considered a modification
of the Company Disclosure Schedule for purposes of determining the existence
of a Company Material Adverse Change or the purpose of determining the
occurrence of any of the events in Section 8.2(c); and provided, further,
that in the event the Purchaser elects to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser shall be deemed to
have irrevocably and forever waived the right to assert that any of the
matters set forth on any update of the Company Disclosure Schedule provides
the basis for, or otherwise constitutes a breach by the Company of any of its
representations and warranties set forth herein.    [SIGNATURES ARE ON
