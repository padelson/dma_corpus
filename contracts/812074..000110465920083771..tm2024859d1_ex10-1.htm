because of the failure of any party (Defaulting Party) to satisfy any of its
obligations under this clause 6 then: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| the Buyer (where the Defaulting Party is the Seller); or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| the Seller (where the Defaulting Party is the Buyer), 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(in either case the Non-Defaulting Party) may (at its option and by notice to
the Defaulting Party):

  



   | (iii)| proceed to Completion so far as is practical without affecting
or waiving their rights under this deed; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iv)| defer Completion for up to 10 Business Days after the date on
which Completion was scheduled to occur (in which case the provisions of this
clause will apply to the deferred date for Completion as if it were the date
on which Completion was scheduled to occur); or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (v)| if, on the deferred date on which Completion is scheduled to

damages for breach of this deed.

   | 6.7| Remedies for Buyer breach 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| The Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that if it is the
Defaulting Party or is in breach of any other provision of this deed, such
breach may cause the Seller to be irreparably harmed and damages alone would
not be adequate to compensate the Seller or its Affiliates for such breach,
and agrees that: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| without limiting the relief that the Seller is entitled to seek,
an order for specific performance would be an appropriate and equitable
remedy and the Seller may seek that or any other equitable order or relief;
and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| in respect of any such application by the Seller the Buyer must
not make or permit to be made on its behalf any submission or contention in
any relevant proceeding to the effect that granting such an order or equitable
relief is not appropriate because the payment of damages alone would be
adequate to compensate the Seller or that such remedy is otherwise inequitable
or disproportionate.

otherwise) and any steps taken by the Seller to enforce this deed or sue for
damages including the Seller's legal costs (on an indemnity basis); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| the difference between the Purchase Price which would have been
payable had the Buyer complied in full with its obligations under this deed
and the price at which the Shares are sold on any bona fide resale in which
the Seller takes reasonable steps to achieve the best price reasonably
obtainable; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| all costs and expenses reasonably incurred in any resale or
attempted resale of the Shares including the Seller's legal costs (on an
indemnity basis) and other professional costs,

losses.

  



   | 6.8| Title and risk 
---|---|---

the Buyer on Completion.

---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| [***].

---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| [***]; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| [***]. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 12.3| Non-solicitation 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Seller and the Seller Guarantor must not, and must procure that each
other Restricted Person does not, induce or entice, or attempt to induce or
entice, any person that is an employee or independent contractor of a Group
Company to leave their employment or engagement with the Group Company, other
than:

  



   | (a)| as a result of advertising employment vacancies in any newspaper,
website or other publication or through a recruitment agency not specifically

---|---|---

---|---|--- 
  



   | 12.4| Duration of prohibitions 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The undertakings in clauses 12.1 and 12.3 begin on the Completion Date and

Share sale deed| 47 
---|--- 



 



    



   | 12.5| Geographic application of prohibitions 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The undertakings in clauses 12.1 and 12.3 apply only if the activity
prohibited by clause 12.1 or 12.3 occurs within:

  



   | (a)| Australia and / or New Zealand; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Queensland, New Zealand, New South Wales, Victoria and / or South

   | 12.6| Interpretation 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Clauses 12.1, 12.3, 12.4 and 12.5 have effect together as if they consisted
of separate provisions, each being severable from the other. Each separate
provision results from combining each undertaking in clause 12.1 and 12.3,
with each period in clause 12.4, and combining each of those
combinations with each area in clause 12.5. If any of those separate
provisions is invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the invalidity
or unenforceability does not affect the validity or enforceability of any of
the other separate provisions or other combinations of the separate
provisions of clauses 12.1, 12.3, 12.4 and 12.5.

  



   | 12.7| Proceedings 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Each party acknowledges that damages alone would not be adequate to
compensate for any breach by the other party of this clause 12 and agrees that
without limiting the relief that the first party is entitled to seek, the
first party may seek an injunction if the other party is in breach of, or
threatens to breach the provisions of this clause 12.

In addition to any other rights of access under this deed, the Buyer must
procure that for a period of 8 years after Completion (or for any longer

---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| in connection with the prosecution or defence of any Claim by or
against any Seller Group Member (other than Claims by or against any Buyer
Group Member), 
---|---|--- 
  



     

provided that the Buyer is not required to comply with any request under this
clause 13.1 to the extent that doing so is reasonably likely to result in
a waiver of privilege in relation to any document.

  



   | 13.2| Insurance 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| The Seller Group shall maintain all insurance policies currently
in force for the Business, operations and Assets of the Group Companies
(Existing Insurance Policies) until Completion, including among others,
existing commercial general liability policies (Existing General Liability

---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| The Buyer is responsible for, and (subject to this clause 13.2)
assumes all risk in respect of, obtaining, purchasing and maintaining, at

operations and assets following Completion. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| Without limiting the Seller\'s obligations under clauses 5.2 or

Claim which may be covered under any Existing Insurance Policies, the Buyer
must promptly notify the Seller, in writing and as follows: Global Risk
Management Director O-I Glass, Inc. 1 Michael Owens Way, Perrysburg, OH 43551
and General Counsel O-I Glass, Inc. 1 Michael Owens Way, Perrysburg, OH

Insurance Policies are already on notice. On receipt of such written notice,
the Seller must: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| reasonably assist and cooperate with the Group Company in its
efforts to pursue insurance under the Existing Insurance Policies by
providing, to the extent reasonably available, access to copies of the
Existing Insurance Policies, insurance documents, personnel and records
necessary to identify a relevant Existing Insurance Policy and allow the Group
Company to present notice of and pursue the Claim under the Existing
Insurance Policies; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| assign or direct the insurer to pay the insurance proceeds for
any Group Company's Claim to the Group Company (and not to any Seller Group
Member); and 
---|---|---

any other Seller Group Member receives them from the insurer, immediately
upon receipt (without set off or deduction) to the Group Company, 
---|---|--- 
  



  

or, if applicable, must reasonably assure that relevant Seller Group Members
comply with this clause 13.2(c).

  



   | (d)| Subject to and except as set forth in clauses 13.2(e)-(j), if any
fact, matter or circumstance occurring, in whole or part, prior to
Completion: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| has given rise to or, whether before or after Completion, gives
rise to coverage; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| would have given rise to coverage but for the operation of an
insurance retention or deductible, 
---|---|--- 
  



  

under an Existing General Liability Insurance Policy for a product liability
claim, then the Seller must, on the Buyer's written demand, pay to the
relevant Group Company, or reimburse the relevant Group Company for, an
amount in respect of the relevant product liability claim not exceeding the
retention or deductible under the Existing General Liability Policies
(Deductible Claim).

  



   

Share sale deed| 49 
---|--- 



 



    



   | (e)| The Seller is not liable in respect of a Deductible Claim if: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| following Completion, a Group Company has failed to use
reasonable endeavours to comply with the provisions of the Group
Company\'s contract relating to the products that are the subject of the
product liability claim; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| such failure is alleged to have caused the product liability
claim or it has increased the amount of the Seller\'s liability in respect of
the Deductible Claim. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (f)| The Seller is not liable in respect of a Deductible Claim unless: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| the amount of the Deductible Claim is over $75,000, in which case
the Seller is liable for the amount of the Deductible Claim in excess of
$75,000; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| the Buyer has notified the Seller of the Deductible Claim no
later than 12 months after the Completion Date; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| the Buyer has notified the Seller in writing no later than 20
Business Days after the date on which the Buyer or a Group Company first
becomes aware of circumstances that may give rise to a Deductible Claim,
providing reasonable details of the facts, matters or circumstances giving
rise to the Deductible Claim, the basis of the Deductible Claim and an
estimate of the amount of the Deductible Claim, in each case, to the extent
known by the Buyer as at the date of the notice. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (g)| If, in respect of a Deductible Claim the Buyer gives notice: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| the Buyer must act and must procure that each relevant Group
Company acts in good faith in relation to the Deductible Claim; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| the Buyer must give to the Seller all information and assistance
as the Seller may reasonably require in relation to the Deductible Claim and
must regularly consult with the Seller in relation to the conduct of any
proceedings or negotiations in relation to the Deductible Claim; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| the Buyer agrees to have due regard to the Seller's suggestions
as to the defence or settlement of matters in respect of or giving rise to
the Deductible Claim, 
---|---|--- 
  



  

in each case, provided that the Buyer and each Group Company is not required
to do any act, matter or thing that would or may waive, or would or may have
the effect of waiving, legal professional privileges.

  



   | (h)| The Seller's monetary obligation for Deductible Claims under
clause 13.2(d) shall be capped at, and shall not exceed in the aggregate in
any event, $7,325,000. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| For the avoidance of doubt, clause 13.2(d) does not apply to a
loss which has been borne and satisfied in full by a Group Company prior to
Completion. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   | (j)| Before the Existing General Liability Policies' policy periods
expire, the Seller will not cause to be made any material modifications or
amendments to those policies' provisions, terms or conditions and if the
insurer seeks to do so, Seller will provide reasonable notice to Buyer.

following Completion, use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that with effect
from Completion each Shared Contract is effectively replaced by:

Group Company; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| a contract between the counterparty to the Shared Contract and a
Seller Group Member, 
---|---|---

obligations under the Shared Contract before Completion continues to have
rights or obligations after Completion that are substantially the same as
those of that Seller Group Member under the Shared Contract
before Completion.

  



   | 14.2| Rights and obligations under Shared Contracts pending separation 
---|---|--- 
  



  

If any Shared Contract is not separated in the manner contemplated in clause
14.1, with effect from Completion the Seller must use its reasonable
endeavours to make available to the Group the benefits of such Shared
Contract which the Group enjoyed in the period before Completion in
substantially the same manner (and subject to substantially the same
limitations) as those benefits were made available on in such period
(subject to the Group's compliance with the terms of that Shared Contract as
if a party thereto) and provided that:

  



   | (a)| the Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Group Members for any loss
suffered by any of them as a result of any action or omission of a Group
Company (to the extent such act or omission is within the power or control of
a Group Company) that would be a breach of that Shared Contract were the
relevant Group Company a party thereto; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| the Seller indemnifies the Buyer against, and must pay to the
Buyer on demand the amount of, any Indemnified Loss suffered or incurred by a
Buyer Group Member as a consequence of or in connection with any acts or
omissions of, or events caused or contributed to by, a Seller Group Member
under or in connection with any Shared Contract, other than acts or omissions
of a Seller Group Member that are performed at the direction of the Buyer.

unless the Warranty is expressed to be given only at a particular time in
which case it is given as at that time.

  



   | 15.2| Warranties separate 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| Each Warranty is to be treated as a separate Warranty and is not
limited by reference to any other Warranty or any other provision of this
deed. The parties agree that the Warranties are contractual only.

   | (b)| Each Warranty remains in full force and effect after Completion.

---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| the Buyer has extensive knowledge and experience of the
manufacturing industry in Australia and has had the benefit of
independent legal, financial and technical advice relating to its proposed

Seller Group Member has made any warranty as to the accuracy of any forecast,
budget, estimate, projection, statement of opinion or statement of intention
provided to the Buyer or its Representatives before the date of this deed;

Schedule 11 Completion Accounts

  



   | 1.| Part  1 - Principles and Policies of Completion Accounts  
---|---|--- 
    



   | 1.1| General Comments 
---|---|--- 
  



  

In preparing the Completion Accounts:

  



   | (a)| the individual line items to be included in the calculation of
Net Debt and Working Capital for the purposes of the Completion Accounts are
as set out in Part 3 and Part 4 of this Schedule 11 (subject, where
applicable, to the provisions of Part 1 and Part 2 of this Schedule 11); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| the Completion Accounts must be prepared as if it were being
prepared at the end of the financial year of the Group; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| financial data will be taken from the management accounting
records contained in the HFM accounting system (sourced from SAP) of the
Group, on a basis consistent with that data's general classification in those
accounting records, noting this is at (the Low Level HFM Accounts), and such
data shall be presumed to be accurate; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| the Low Level HFM Accounts will include the financial data for
the following entities as presented below: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| ACI Packaging Services Pty Ltd; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| O-I Operations (Australia) Pty Ltd; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| Brisbane Cullet Pty Ltd; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iv)| O-I International Pty Ltd; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (v)| O-I Operations (NZ) Ltd; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (vi)| ACI Glass Packaging Penrith Pty Ltd. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The following principles and policies shall apply in the preparation of the
Completion Accounts:

  



   | (e)| Each balance included within the Completion Accounts will be
classified into one of three columns headed Working Capital, Net Debt and
Other. The form of the Completion Accounts and the split by category (Working
Capital, Net Debt or Other) shall be as provided in Part 3 of this Schedule
11. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (f)| Each line item and balance in the Completion Accounts will be
prepared based on the amounts recorded as at 11.59pm (Sydney time) on the
Completion Date in the relevant Low Level HFM Accounts. The relevant Low Level
HFM Accounts for each line item are set out in Part 3 of this Schedule 11. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (g)| The Completion Accounts will reflect the consolidated financial
position of the Group as at 11.59pm (Sydney time) on the Completion Date and
will not take into account the effects of any events occurring after such date
or any effects of the sale of the Shares to the Buyer as contemplated by this
deed, unless such effects are required to be taken into consideration under
the Accounting Standards. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

Share sale deed| 125 
---|--- 



 



    



   | (h)| For the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no duplication or
overlapping in calculating the Completion Accounts which would result in the
same item being considered an asset or liability within Working Capital and
decrease or increase to Net Debt respectively. Further, nor should an amount
be considered a liability (or increase in Net Debt) for multiple
adjustments (e.g. Transaction Cost (as that term is defined in item 1.5(m) of
this Schedule 11 below) and bonus adjustment). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| Any new general ledger accounts which arise during the ordinary
course of business must be included within, and assigned to, the relevant
components of the Completion Accounts based on the Low Level HFM Accounts
Classification. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The following principles and policies shall apply in the preparation of the
Completion Accounts which includes Net Debt, and Working Capital, on the same
basis as the Working Capital and Net Debt presented in Part 3 and Part 4 of
this Schedule 11. Key principles for preparation are set out below.

  



   | 1.2| Trade and other receivables 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Trade receivables, which generally have 60 - 90 day terms, are recognised and
carried at original invoice amount less a provision for bad debts. A provision
for doubtful debts is considered on an individual basis and the provision is
recognised only where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be
able to collect the debt. Any unallocated cash balances within accounts
receivable must be allocated and reconciled to each debtor at Completion.
There will no factoring or trade receivables financing in place at Completion
and all receivables will transfer unencumbered. As such, for clarification
purposes, the working capital peg normalized trade receivables to exclude the
impact of debtor factoring programs.

  



   | (a)| Any trade receivable balance that is greater than 90 days overdue
will be treated as bad debt and provisioned for the purposes of the
Completion Accounts which will result in the corresponding amount being
reduced from Working Capital. To the extent this receivable is collected
prior to the settlement of the Completion Accounts, this amount shall be
due to Seller; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| All credit balances included within trade receivables relating to
historical customer rebates earned which have been unapplied greater than 12
months, shall be reclassified from Working Capital to Net Debt; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| The miscellaneous receivables adjustment, whose impact shall be
to decrease Working Capital and shall be calculated as the total of amounts
included within Low Level HFM Account 0334, as of the Completion Date, which
relate to non-trade receivables from Affiliates and joint ventures of the
Seller Group relating to services and products sold by the Group. These
balances within Low Level HFM Account 0334 at Completion will remain with the
Seller. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 1.3| Inventories 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Inventories comprise finished goods, materials and work in progress. Finished
inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Inventories are net of stock obsolescence provisions.

  



   | (a)| The raw materials inventory adjustment, the impact of which shall
be to reduce Working Capital, shall be calculated as the amount of margin in
the raw materials inventory line item as a result of the margin charged by O-I
International Pty Ltd to O-I Operations (Australia) Pty Ltd and O-I
Operations (NZ) Limited at 11.59pm (Sydney time) on the Completion Date
presented in Part 5 of this Schedule 11. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

Share sale deed| 126 
---|--- 



 



    



   | (b)| The quantity of finished goods inventory at Completion shall be
subject to a Stocktake performed under Part 2 of this Schedule 11, the impact
of which shall be considered as an adjustment to inventory value in Working
Capital. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 1.4| Trade creditors and accrued liabilities 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Liabilities for trade creditors, other payables and accrued liabilities are
recognised at cost, which is the fair value of the consideration to be paid in
the future for goods or services received, whether or not billed to the Group
at Completion. These accounts will be recognised applying a methodology
consistent with past practice specifically in relation to provisions reserves
and accruals which were recorded in the Last Accounts.

  



   | (a)| Trade creditors are to exclude balances overdue greater than 90
days and such balances shall be treated as a Net Debt. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Trade creditors, other payables, and accrued liabilities will
exclude Transaction Costs (as defined below) which shall be excluded from
Working Capital and treated as Net Debt. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| Trade creditors are to exclude all overdue obligations relating
to GST, PAYE, land tax and VAT settlement included within creditors listing.
These shall be treated as Net Debt and excluded from Working Capital. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 1.5| Debt-like Items 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Net Debt will be prepared on the same basis as the Net Debt presented in
Part 3 and Part 4 below.

  



  

The following items should be considered Debt-like Items and considered in
accordance with those other Debt like Items identified in Part 1 of this
Schedule 11 which:

  



   | (a)| The capex adjustment shall relate to cash payments outstanding in
relation to the AK4 furnace repair in New Zealand and increase Net Debt by a
fixed amount of A$10.5 million with a corresponding increase in Working
capital for the amount of capex related payables within trade creditors at
Completion. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Any creditors specifically relating to the MB4 hot furnace repair
will also be included in Net Debt and excluded from Working Capital. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| To the extent not included in Working Capital at Completion, the
amount reflecting any payments due to Agility to terminate the existing
contract shall be treated as Net Debt. It is the Buyer's intention to bring
logistics services in house for Buyer. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| To the extent not already included within Working Capital, any
amounts outstanding under the Permitted Debt Arrangements, (limited to
commodity hedges, the Australian Overdraft Agreement, and MasterCard Corporate
Card Facility, and excluding the Permitted Bank Guarantee Arrangements). All
interest rate derivatives and currency swaps will be paid out and
terminated at Completion. Commodity hedges, shall be valued based on fair
market value at Completion, based on validated external statements. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (e)| The amounts considered which relate to restructuring costs
accrued, including any unpaid severance related costs (including annual
leave) for those employees part of the regional overhead cost savings program. 
---|---|---

redundancy provision (off balance sheet adjustment), relating to regional
overhead costs savings program and calculated as future redundancy payments by
the Group in relation to employees identified in Schedule 13.5.1.3, that

the avoidance of doubts, this adjustment will exclude any individuals listed
in the aforementioned schedule which remain with Seller post Completion. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (g)| The total amount of vested long-service leave, as defined by the
relevant legislation in each respective state or territory, multiplied by 70%
(to apply the applicable tax effect). This adjustment will be supported by a
detailed calculation on consistent historical basis, which will include a
listing of employees supporting the balance at Completion. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (h)| The total amount of annual leave in excess of 4 weeks multiplied
by 70% (to apply the applicable tax effect). This adjustment will be

supporting the balance at Completion.

   | (i)| Customer contingency accrual relating to a one off incentive
arrangement with Diageo (contained within SAP account 4400140). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (j)| In respect of pallets and layer boards (tier sheets)
("Packaging"), parties agree: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| The Seller shall validate the Packaging balances prior to
Completion by estimating the Packaging quantities 'under glass' during the
Stocktake; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| For the Packaging quantities at customers and third party
holding locations, the Seller will make available documentation of recent
inventory counting procedures and accounting records, as reasonably available; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| In accordance with the Seller's accounting policies and taking
into account the quantities estimated in (i) and (ii), if the resulting net
book value of the Packaging is at least 92.5% of the 2019 average Packaging
net book value ("Packaging Tolerance"), there shall be no adjustment to Net
Debt; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iv)| If the resulting net book value of the Packaging is less than
the Packaging Tolerance, there shall be an adjustment to Net Debt for the
shortfall in value, as compared to the Packaging Tolerance. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (k)| The taxes payable at Completion Date will be treated as Net Debt
in the Completion Accounts. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (l)| A provision will be raised as a Debt-like Item in the Completion
Accounts (and a corresponding increase in Working Capital) for an amount
equal to any unpaid bonuses at Completion Date (excluding those in 1.5(m)
which are payable and due by a Group Company in respect of an employee of the
Group based on current global scheme KPIs of the Seller Group. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (m)| For the purposes of this Schedule 11, Transaction Costs (also

Share sale deed| 128 
---|--- 



 



    

  



   | (ii)| There shall be a fixed adjustment at Completion which shall
increase Net Debt (and corresponding increase Working Capital to the extent
it is accrued) by A$300,000 related to the extension of employee notice period
for the thirteen employees part of the transaction retention program. For the
avoidance of doubt, this shall be the total amount due for retention notice
benefits. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (n)| The sick leave adjustment, whose impact shall be to reduce Net
Debt, shall be equal to the liability (supported by reasonable records and
calculations) recognised at Completion Date in respect of underpaid sick leave
that is recognised as a result of the Australian Federal Court ruling in
relation the Mondelez v AMWU [2019] FCAFC 138 case. This adjustment
will apply if the case is overturned prior to the settlement of Completion
Accounts. For clarity, if this case is not overturned prior to settlement of
the Completion Accounts, the amount (which was A$1.9 million at Dec19) will be
included in Net Debt at Completion. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (o)| The tax receivable adjustment relates to an estimated income tax
refund on assessment of O-I Operations (NZ) Ltd ("OINZ") income tax return
for the year ended 31 December 2019. In the event the income tax return is
lodged with the Inland Revenue Department prior to Completion Accounts being
settled and a copy of the income tax return supporting the refund is provided
to Buyer, the amount of the refund shall be considered a reduction in Net Debt
at Completion. For clarity, this tax receivable will be excluded from Working
Capital. 
---|---|---

reflecting fire standards compliance at the Penrith plant of which there
would be a corresponding increase to Working Capital to the extent accrued at
Completion. If compliance is confirmed prior to Completion, this adjustment
is not required. To the extent that works are performed by third parties
towards achieving compliance prior Completion and have been paid for by the
Group, then this Net Debt adjustment shall be reduced by such amount paid. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (q)| A fixed amount of A$500,000 shall be considered Net Debt
reflecting a contribution to the structural rectification of MB3 of which
there would be a corresponding increase to Working Capital to the extent
