BASE PURCHASE PRICE; CONTINGENT EARNOUT PAYMENT 

Section 6.1 _Base Purchase Price_. The aggregate base purchase price for the
Assets and the Business shall be U.S. $598 million (the "Base Purchase
Price"). The Base Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment as provided in
_Article 7_ , _Section 8.14_, _Article 12_ and _Section 20.10.2_ or as
otherwise provided under this Agreement, and any such adjustment shall be
reflected as an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price.

 



16 Section 6.2 _Contingent Refinery Earnout Payment_. Buyer shall pay to BP
Products as additional consideration a sum of up to U.S. $700 million (the
"Maximum Earnout Amount"), subject to the following terms and conditions:

 

6.2.1 _Term_. The term shall end on the earlier of (a) the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the commencement of the first Annual Earnout Period, as
defined below, and (b) the date the total cumulative Annual Earnout Amounts,
as defined below, paid by Buyer to BP Products equal the Maximum Earnout
Amount (the "Term"). The Term shall be divided into up to six (6) successive
twelve calendar month periods (each an "Annual Earnout Period" and
collectively, the "Earnout Period") with the first Annual Earnout Period
commencing (a) at the Effective Time if the Closing Date is on the first day
of the calendar month; or (b) at 12:01 a.m. local time on the first day of the
first full calendar month following the Closing Date, if the Closing Date is
not on the first day of the calendar month. If necessary, the Term shall be
automatically extended to allow for completion of six (6) full Annual Earnout
Periods. As used herein, the terms "calendar month" and "calendar process
month" shall have the same meaning and shall consist of the period from 12:00
am local time on the first day of each month until 11:59 pm on the last day of
each month.

6.2.2 _Determination of Annual Earnout Amount_.

(a) Within forty-five (45) days following the last day of each Annual Earnout
Period, Buyer shall deliver a written statement (such statement being referred
to herein as the "Annual Earnout Statement") to BP Products which shall set
forth (i) the gross margin for the Annual Earnout Period calculated as set
forth below (the "Annual Earnout Period Gross Margin"); (ii) the average ASCI
3-2-1 crack spread corresponding to each calendar process month during
such Annual Earnout Period calculated as set forth below (each being a
"Monthly ASCI 3-2-1 Crack"); (iii) the actual volume of crude processed at the
Refinery for each calendar process month during such Annual Earnout
Period calculated as set forth below (each being a "Monthly Crude Volume");
(iv) the actual volume of total Refinery feedstock processed during each
calendar process month (which for the avoidance of doubt includes and details
the crude oil and any other hydrocarbon feedstocks or intermediates and
purchased hydrogen input into the Refinery as reflected in the official
Refinery yield accounting system or successor system) (each being, a "Monthly
Throughput Volume"); (v) the monthly gross margin for each calendar process
month during such Annual Earnout Period calculated as set forth below (each
being a "Monthly Gross Margin"); (vi) the earnout amount to be paid by Buyer
to BP Products, if any, calculated as set forth below (the "Annual Earnout
Amount"); (vii) appropriate supporting detail showing how all such
calculations were made; and (viii) a certification from an authorized officer
of Buyer that Buyer has operated the Refinery in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 6.6_ during the applicable Annual Earnout Period.

6.2.3 _Determination of the Annual Earnout Amount_.

(a) The Monthly ASCI 3-2-1 Crack shall be determined using the following
formula: the value of three (3) barrels of crude at the ASCI Price subtracted
from the value of two (2) barrels of 85 octane CBOB A at the CBOB Price plus
the value of one (1) barrel of ultra-low sulfur diesel at the Distillate
Price, with the resulting value divided by three, where: (A) "ASCI Price"
means the Crude Trade Month average Argus ASCI/WTI Differential
(PA0006594,2,49; Argus Sour Crude Index (ASCI) month 1, Houston Close, diff)
plus the Crude Trade Month average Argus WTI Differential to CMA NYMEX
(PA0003360,2,49; WTI Diff to CMA NYMEX weighted average month 1, Houston
Close, diff), plus the Calendar Process Month average Argus NYMEX WTI
(PA0002652,2,5; NYMEX WTI month 1, Houston Close, settlement), where the
"Crude Trade Month" includes all Argus assessment days from the 26th

 



17  day of the month two (2) months prior to the Calendar Process Month through
the 25th day of the month prior to the Calendar Process Month and where the
"Calendar Process Month" means the calendar month in which the crude is
processed; (B) "CBOB Price" means the arithmetic average for the Product Trade
Month of the daily Argus Gasoline 85 CBOB Colonial A grade cycle 1 
Houston average of the high and low bearing code #PA00069982, converted from
cents per gallon to dollars per barrel; provided, however, that for any
Product Trade Months during which Colonial Pipeline has issued a bulletin
stating that the 9.0 RVP can be scheduled on the pipeline and an Argus
supplemental price is in effect, then the "CBOB Price" shall be the arithmetic
average for the Product Trade Month of the daily Argus Gasoline 85 CBOB
Colonial A grade 9.0 RVP Supplemental cycle 1  Houston average of the high
and low bearing code #PA00077422 converted from cents per gallon to dollars
per barrel; and (C) "Distillate Price" means the arithmetic average for the
Product Trade Month of the daily Argus Diesel 61 10ppm (ULS) Colonial
pipeline cycle 1  Houston average of the high and low bearing the code
#PA00040892, converted from cents per gallon to dollars per barrel. If Argus
(or successor publisher) fails to publish any reference price set forth in
clauses (A) through (C) above for any trading days in the applicable month,
the average of the remaining days in the month will be used. If Argus (or
successor publisher) ceases to publish any referenced price set forth
in clauses (A) through (C) above, Buyer and BP Products will negotiate in
good faith to agree upon a new pricing formula using suitable industry
available quotations maintaining a representative 3-2-1 crack spread. "Product
Trade Month" will be the actual pricing days on the Colonial Pipeline
shipping schedule as published by Colonial Pipeline Company on its website,
which, without limiting the foregoing, typically begins approximately ten (10)
or less days immediately prior to the calendar month in which the product is
produced (the "Product Production Month") through a day which is approximately
ten (10) days or less prior to the end of the Product Production Month and
shall be the aggregation of all the pricing days that Argus generates prompt
cycle assessments for all of the Pasadena pump cycles (usually 6 cycles per
month) associated with the Product Production Month.

 

(b) Subject to adjustment as provided herein, the "Monthly Volume" for each
calendar process month during any Annual Earnout Period shall be equal to the
Monthly Crude Volume for each calendar process month plus fifty percent (50%)
of the arithmetic difference between the Monthly Throughput Volume minus the
Monthly Crude Volume. Within ten (10) Business Days following the end of each
calendar process month, Buyer shall provide BP Products a written report with
appropriate supporting detail setting forth Buyers calculation of the Monthly
Volume for the preceding calendar process month, including each element of
crude oil and any other hydrocarbon feedstocks or intermediates and purchased
hydrogen input into the Refinery. Upon reasonable advance written notice, BP
Products shall have the right, with respect to each Annual Earnout Period, at
BP Products sole cost and expense, to conduct one audit of the records of
Buyer to verify the calculation of the Monthly Volumes during each Annual
Earnout Period, and such audit must be completed no later than forty-five
(45) Business Days following the provision by the Buyer to BP Products of the
Annual Earnout Statement. Buyer shall cooperate with BP Products and provide
BP Products with reasonable access to Buyers employees and records to enable
BP Products to complete its audit in a timely manner.

(c) The Monthly Gross Margin for each calendar month shall be calculated by
multiplying the Monthly ASCI 3-2-1 Crack by the corresponding Monthly Volume.

(d) The Annual Earnout Period Gross Margin shall be the sum of the Monthly
Gross Margins for such Annual Earnout Period.

 



18 (e) The "Annual Earnout Threshold Amount" and "Annual Cap" for each Annual
Earnout Period shall be as follows:



      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
  

Annual

 

Earnout

Period

 |  | Annual Earnout  Threshold 
Amount 
(U.S. $ Millions) |  |  | Annual Cap 
(U.S. $  Millions) | 
    

1

 |  | $ | 1,775 |  |  | $ | 200 | 
  

2

 |  | $ | 1,775 |  |  | $ | 200 | 
  

3

 |  | $ | 1,775 |  |  | $ | 200 |

5

 |  | $ | 1,650 |  |  | $ | 250 | 
  

6

 |  | $ | 1,650 |  |  | $ | 250 | 
 

(f) The Annual Earnout Amount shall be calculated using the following formula:
the Annual Earnout Period Gross Margin _minus_ the Annual Earnout Threshold
Amount, with the resulting value _multiplied by_ fifty percent (50%). If the
resulting calculation is equal to or less than zero dollars ($0), no Annual
Earnout Amount shall be due to BP Products for such Annual Earnout Period. If
the resulting calculation of the Annual Earnout Amount exceeds the
corresponding Annual Cap, then such Annual Earnout Amount shall be deemed to
equal the corresponding Annual Cap, and none of the excess will be carried
over to subsequent Annual Earnout Periods. For the avoidance of doubt, each
year the Annual Earnout Period Gross Margin shall be calculated without taking
into account any excess or shortfall of the Annual Earnout Amount that may
have resulted from any prior years calculation.

Section 6.3 _Disagreement Regarding Earn-Out_. 

6.3.1 On or prior to the fifty-fifth (55th) Business Day following receipt by
BP Products of the Annual Earnout Statement (with respect to each
Annual Earnout Period, the "Annual Earnout Objection Period"), BP Products
shall deliver to Buyer either a notice indicating that BP Products accepts the
amounts in such Annual Earnout Statement (an "Annual Earnout
Acceptance Notice") or a written statement specifying those amounts with
which BP Products disagrees in such Annual Earnout Statement (an "Annual
Earnout Disagreement Notice"). If BP Products delivers to Buyer an Annual
Earnout Acceptance Notice, or if BP Products does not deliver an Annual
Earnout Disagreement Notice on or prior to the last day of an Annual Earnout
Objection Period, then such Annual Earnout Statement shall be deemed to be a
Final Annual Earnout Statement and the determination therein shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon BP Products and Buyer, except for instances of
fraud or manifest error. If BP Products timely delivers an Annual Earnout
Disagreement Notice with respect to an Annual Earnout Statement, only those
matters specified and described in such Annual Earnout Disagreement Notice
shall be deemed to be in dispute (the "Disputed Earnout Amounts"), and all
other matters included in such Annual Earnout Statement shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon BP Products and Buyer and not subject to further
challenge on any ground for any purpose, except for instances of fraud or
manifest error.

 

6.3.2 If an Annual Earnout Disagreement Notice is timely delivered to Buyer,
then BP Products and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve their
disagreements with respect to any

 



19  Disputed Earnout Amounts. In the event that Buyer and BP Products are unable
to resolve all such disagreements within thirty (30) days after Buyers
receipt of any such Annual Earnout Disagreement Notice, either Buyer or BP
Products may at any time thereafter submit such remaining disagreements to the
Independent Accountants. If BP Products and Buyer cannot agree within five (5)
days on a single impartial accountant to serve as the Independent Accounts,
then BP Products and Buyer will each nominate an impartial accountant to serve
as an Independent Accountant, and the two Independent Accountants so
designated shall select a third impartial accountant to serve as the third
Independent Accountant.

6.3.3 Buyer and BP Products shall use Reasonable Efforts to cause the
Independent Accountants, once appointed, to resolve all remaining
disagreements with respect to the calculation of the Disputed Earnout Amounts
as soon as practicable, but in any event shall direct the Independent
Accountants to render a determination within thirty (30) days after retention
of the Independent Accountants. The Independent Accountants shall consider
only those items and amounts in the Buyers and BP Products respective
calculations of the Disputed Earnout Amounts. In resolving any disputed item,
the Independent Accountants may not assign a value to any item greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either Party. The
Independent Accountants determination of the Disputed Earnout Amounts shall
be based solely on written materials submitted by the Buyer and BP Products (
_i.e._ , not on independent review) and on the definitions included in this
Agreement;  _provided, however_ , that the Independent Accountants will have
no authority to interpret any provision of this Agreement and any and all
disputes regarding the interpretation or meaning of any provision of this
Agreement will be resolved pursuant to _Section 20.11_. The determination of
the Independent Accountants shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties
and shall not be subject to appeal or further review.

 

6.3.4 The costs and expenses of the Independent Accountants in determining any
Disputed Earnout Amount shall be borne by the Buyer, on the one hand, and BP
Products, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of
the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the amount actually
contested by such Party. For example, if BP Products claims the Monthly
Gross Margin is $1,000 more than the amount determined by Buyer, and Buyer
contests only $500 of the amount claimed by BP Products, and if the
Independent Accountants ultimately resolve the dispute by awarding BP Products
$300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Independent
Accountants will be allocated sixty percent (60%) ( _i.e._ , 300 ÷ 500) to
Buyer and forty percent (40%) ( _i.e._ , 200 ÷ 500) to BP Products. In
connection with their determination of any Disputed Earnout Amount, the
Independent Accountants shall, pursuant to the terms of this _Section 6.3.4_,
also determine the allocation of its fees and expenses between Buyer and BP
Products, which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Parties and shall, except in the event of fraud or manifest error, not be
subject to appeal or further review.

Section 6.4 _Earn-out Statement_. An Annual Earnout Statement with respect to
an Annual Earnout Period shall become a "Final Annual Earnout Statement" on
the earliest to occur of: (i) the expiration of the Annual Earnout Objection
Period for such Annual Earnout Period if an Annual Earnout Disagreement Notice
has not been timely delivered to Buyer, (ii) the date that an Annual Earnout
Acceptance Notice with respect to such Annual Earnout Period has been
delivered to Buyer, and (iii) the date the final determination of the Annual
Earnout Amount is made by the Independent Accountants. The date on which an
Annual Earnout Statement becomes a Final Annual Earnout Statement pursuant to
the immediately foregoing sentence is referred to as an "Annual Earnout Final
Determination Date."

Section 6.5 _Payment Obligation_. Subject to _Section 16.6.3_, within fifteen
(15) Business Days following the Annual Earnout Final Determination Date
corresponding to each Annual Earnout Period, Buyer shall pay to BP Products
the Annual Earnout Amount due to BP Products, if any, with

 



20  respect to such Annual Earnout Period; _provided, however_ , that in no
event shall the total Annual Earnout Amounts paid to BP Products exceed the
Maximum Earnout Amount. Upon receipt by BP Products of the Maximum Earnout
Amount, Buyer shall have no further obligations to BP Products with regard to
any Annual Earnout Amount and the calculation of and obligations to provide
information under this _Article 6_ shall cease. 

Section 6.6 _Obligations of Buyer_. During any Annual Earnout Period, Buyer
and its Affiliates will operate the Refinery in the Ordinary Course of
Business in the same manner that a reasonable and prudent operator would
operate, including seeking to maximize the operational capability and
volumetric utilization of the Refinery on a stand-alone basis.
Buyer covenants and agrees that it will not take or omit to take any action
or enter into any transaction, the intent of which is to avoid payment of or
reduce or minimize the amount of the Annual Earnout Amounts. Buyer agrees that
it will not include the Maximum Earnout Amount, the Annual Earnout Amounts,
the Annual Earnout Threshold Amount or Annual Cap as factors or considerations
in any of the Buyers or its Affiliates linear programming models or any
other optimization tools that may be or become used by the Buyer or its
Affiliates to commercially optimize the system and that Buyer will at all
times operate the Refinery in a commercially reasonable manner as if the Buyer
did not have an obligation to make any earnout payments pursuant to _Section
6.2_ through _Section 6.7_.

Section 6.7 _Assumption of Earnout Obligations by Successors in Interest_.
Upon any, direct or indirect, sale or disposition of the Refinery or the
Refinery Assets to a Third Party, the Buyer shall cause the purchaser or
surviving company, as applicable, to unconditionally assume the
obligations of Buyer under this _Article 6_. Furthermore, no such sale or
disposition shall have the effect of releasing the Buyer from any of its
Liabilities under this _Article 6_, unless otherwise consented to in writing
by BP Products. 

Section 6.8 [ _Intentionally Omitted_.]

Section 6.9 _Past Due Payments_. Any Annual Earnout Amount that is not paid by
or on behalf of the Buyer within ten (10) days from the date when due pursuant
to this Agreement shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the
Default Interest Rate, which shall be due and payable when the past due Annual
Earnout Amount is made; _provided, however_ , the provision for such interest
shall not relieve the Buyer from its duty and obligation to pay the Annual
Earnout Amount on the due date thereof or be deemed to be a waiver of any
right or remedy available to the BP Products at law or equity for such failure
to pay the Annual Earnout Amount on the due date thereof. 

Section 6.10 _Dispute Resolution of Certain Earnout Matters_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, any Dispute arising under _Section
6.2.3(a)_ (in the event Buyer and BP Products are unable to agree to a new
pricing formula, as contemplated therein), _Section 6.5_, _Section 6.6_,
_Section 6.7_ or  _Section 6.9_ shall be resolved in accordance with
_Section 20.11_.

ARTICLE 7

 

PRE-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BASE PURCHASE PRICE

Section 7.1 _Estimated Closing Statement_. At least three (3) days prior to
the Closing Date, the Sellers, in consultation with Buyer, shall prepare and
deliver to the Buyer a statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement") that
shall set forth in reasonable detail (and be accompanied by reasonable
documentation) the following estimated adjustments to the Base Purchase Price
(each an "Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount"): (a) the Estimated
Hydrocarbon Inventory Value, (b) the Estimated Non-Hydrocarbon Inventory
Value, (c) the Estimated Net Prorated Amount, and (d) the Assigned Branded
Jobber Contracts Adjustment. The Estimated Closing Adjustment Amounts for
_Section 7.1(a)_ and

 



21   _Section 7.1(b)_ shall be based on best estimates of related volumes at
the Effective Time and prepared generally in accordance with the methodologies
and procedures set forth in  _Schedules 12.1.1_ and _12.1.2_ (but without
the requirement of a physical inventory or quality measurement). In the event
that Buyer and Sellers have any disagreement regarding preparation of the
Estimated Closing Statement, the Buyer and Sellers shall nevertheless close
based upon Sellers Estimated Closing Statement.

Section 7.2 _Closing Payment_. The payment (the "Closing Payment") payable by
the Buyer at the Closing in accordance with _Section 11.2.1_ shall be the
Base Purchase Price (a) _increased_ by the Estimated Hydrocarbon
Inventory Value, (b) _increased_ by the Estimated Non-Hydrocarbon Inventory
Value, (c) _increased_ or _reduced_ , as applicable, by the Estimated Net
Prorated Amount, (d) _increased_ or _reduced_ , as applicable, by
the Assigned Branded Jobber Contracts Adjustment, (e) _reduced_ , if
applicable, by any Casualty Loss Adjustment Amount(s), (f) _reduced_ , if
applicable, by any Title Defect Adjustment Amount(s), and (g) _reduced_ ,
if applicable, by any Disclosure Adjustment(s).

Section 7.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment for Non-Assignable Branded
Jobber Contracts_.

7.3.1 Subject to the provisions of _Schedule 7.3.2_ , in the event that the
average daily gasoline sales volume under the Assigned Branded Jobber
Contracts during the twelve (12) full, consecutive calendar months ending on
the last date of the calendar month that immediately precedes the calendar
month in which this Agreement is effective (such amount, the "BP Products
Sales Volume") differs from sixty-four thousand (64,000) barrels per day (bpd)
of gasoline (such amount, the "Target Sales Volume"), the Buyer and the
Sellers shall _increase_ or  _reduce_ , as applicable, the Base Purchase
Price payable by Buyer at Closing as follows (the "Assigned Branded Jobber
Contracts Adjustment"): (i) in the event that the BP Products Sales Volume is
greater than 64,000 bpd then the Base Purchase Price will be increased by six
hundred twenty-five dollars ($625) for each bpd of additional BP Products
Sales Volume in excess of 64,000 bpd, (ii) in the event that the BP Products
Sales Volume is between 64,000 bpd and 54,400 bpd then the Base Purchase
Price will be reduced by an amount equal to the product of (x) twenty-five
million dollars ($25,000,000) times (y) (1) the sum of 64,000 bpd less the BP
Products Sales Volume divided by (2) 9,600 and (iii) if the BP Products Sales
Volume is below 54,400 bpd then the Base Purchase Price will be further
reduced by two hundred seventy-six dollars ($276) for each bpd below 54,400
bpd. For purposes hereof, the "Assigned Branded Jobber Contracts" upon which
the BP Products Sales Volume is calculated shall include (a) all Retail
Assigned Contracts which are branded jobber contracts, including any such
contracts in the Southeastern United States added by BP Products between
signing of this Agreement and the Effective Time ( _provided_ BP Products will
use Reasonable Efforts to the extent feasible to add all such branded jobber
contracts no less than twenty-one (21) days prior to the Closing) pursuant to
the provisions of _Schedule 7.3.2_ , (b) all branded jobber contracts
originally scheduled as Retail Contracts which expire (without renewal)
following the signing of this Agreement but which jobbers, prior to the
Effective Time, enter into or irrevocably commit to enter into a Contract
with Buyer to be supplied by Buyer or its Affiliates and (c) each branded
jobber contract where the branded jobber under such contract approaches BP
Products requesting to be supplied by Buyer or its Affiliates and for which
BP Products consents to such supply arrangement and jobber, prior to the
Effective Time, enters into or irrevocably commits to enter into a Contract
with Buyer to be supplied by Buyer or its Affiliates.

 

7.3.2 [Intentionally Omitted].

7.3.3 If an Assigned Branded Jobber Contract is removed by BP Products due to
a cancellation of such contract by BP Products pursuant to subsection (i) of
the provisions of _Schedule 7.3.2_ , then BP Products will replace said
branded jobber contract with other contracts with similar or greater
representative sales volumes in accordance with _Section 7.3.1_.

 



22 7.3.4 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Assigned
Branded Jobber Contracts Adjustment shall be (i) the Buyers sole remedy with
respect to any shortfall between the BP Products Sales Volume and the Target
Sales Volume whether occurring prior to or after Closing and BP Products shall
have no further Liabilities to Buyer with respect thereto, and (ii) BP
Products sole remedy with respect to any excess between the BP Products Sales
Volume and the Target Sales Volume, whether occurring prior to or after
Closing, and the Buyer shall have no further Liabilities to BP Products with
respect thereto. Each Party hereby releases the other Parties from any and all
Liabilities for any such shortfall or excess other than the obligation to
adjust the Base Purchase Price by the value of the Assigned Branded Jobber
Contracts Adjustment in accordance with _Section 7.3.1_.

Section 7.4 [ _Intentionally Omitted_.]

Section 7.5 _Casualty Loss_.

7.5.1 If, before the Closing, all or any portion of the Facilities are damaged
or destroyed in whole or in part (the portion of the Facilities so damaged or
destroyed, the "Damaged Portion"), whether by fire, theft, vandalism, flood,
wind, hurricane, explosion or other casualty (a "Casualty Event"), Seller
related to such Facilities shall notify the Buyer promptly in writing (a
"Casualty Event Notice") of the Casualty Event. The Casualty Event Notice
shall include: (a) a reasonable description of the facts and circumstances
surrounding the Casualty Event; (b) the applicable Sellers preliminary
assessment of the effect of the Casualty Event on the Facilities; (c) the
applicable Sellers preliminary assessment of whether, and the extent to
which, any casualty losses sustained as a result of such Casualty Event
are covered by one or more Seller Insurance Policies then in effect; and (d)
the applicable Sellers election pursuant to _Section 7.5.2_, if applicable.

7.5.2 If: (a) the applicable Seller reasonably expects the Damaged Portion
resulting from a Casualty Event can be fully repaired or restored in
accordance with applicable Laws on or before the Long-Stop Date; and (b) the
aggregate Casualty Loss Amount resulting from all Casualty Events is greater
than five million dollars ($5,000,000) with respect to the Refinery Assets and
Cogen Company Assets (or one million five hundred thousand dollars
($1,500,000) with respect to the Non-Refinery Assets) but less than one
hundred million dollars ($100,000,000), with respect to the Refinery Assets
and Cogen Company Assets (or thirty million dollars ($30,000,000) with respect
to the Non-Refinery Assets), then the applicable Seller may elect, by written
notice to the Buyer, to (i) repair or restore such Damaged Portion in
accordance with _Section 7.5.3_, or (ii) reduce the Base Purchase Price by
the Casualty Loss Amount in respect of such Casualty Event. If, with respect
to any Casualty Event addressed in this _Section 7.5.2_, the applicable
Seller elects to repair or restore the Damaged Portion resulting therefrom
(and completes such repairs or restoration to the Buyers reasonable
satisfaction prior to the Long-Stop Date as the same may be delayed or
extended pursuant to _Section 7.5.3(c)_) or elects in writing to reduce the
Base Purchase Price by the Casualty Loss Amount pursuant to this _Section
7.5.2_, such Casualty Event shall have no effect for purposes of determining
whether Buyers conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 10.1_ have been
fulfilled.

 

7.5.3 If the applicable Seller elects to repair or restore the Damaged Portion
pursuant to _Section 7.5.2(b)(i)_, then (a) the applicable Seller at its
sole cost and expense shall promptly commence and diligently execute the
repair and/or restoration of such Damaged Portion with similar grade quality
and condition or as is otherwise required in accordance with applicable Laws;
(b) the applicable Seller shall be entitled to all of the insurance proceeds
to which the applicable Seller or any of its Affiliates are entitled with
respect to such Casualty Event; and (c) the Closing and the Long-Stop Date
shall be delayed and extended for such reasonable time but not beyond sixty
(60) days as is necessary for the applicable Seller to complete any such
repair or restoration.

 



23 7.5.4 If the aggregate Casualty Loss Amount resulting from all Casualty Events
is in excess of one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) with respect to
the Refinery Assets and Cogen Company Assets (or thirty million dollars
($30,000,000) with respect to the Non-Refinery Assets), then any Party can
terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other Parties unless the
applicable Parties have agreed in writing to a mutually acceptable reduction
in the Base Purchase Price.

7.5.5 If (a) the aggregate Casualty Loss Amount resulting from all Casualty
Events to any portion of the Facilities is greater than five million dollars
($5,000,000) with respect to the Refinery Assets and Cogen Company Assets (or
one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000) with respect to the
Non-Refinery Assets) but less than one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000)
with respect to the Refinery Assets and Cogen Company Assets (or thirty
million dollars ($30,000,000) with respect to the Non-Refinery Assets) and (b)
the Damaged Portion resulting from such Casualty Event cannot reasonably be
expected to be fully repaired or restored in accordance with applicable
Laws on or before the Long-Stop Date, as the same may be delayed or extended
pursuant to _Section 7.5.3(c),_ or the applicable Seller does not elect
either remedy in clauses (i) or (ii) in _Section 7.5.2_, then the
Buyer shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the
Sellers.

7.5.6 If the aggregate Casualty Loss Amount resulting from all Casualty
Events is five million dollars ($5,000,000) with respect to the Refinery
Assets and Cogen Company Assets (or one million five hundred thousand dollars
($1,500,000) with respect to the Non-Refinery Assets) or less: (a) none of
the Parties rights or obligations under this Agreement shall be affected in
any way; (b) there will not be a breach of any representation or warranty by
the applicable Seller as a result of such Casualty Event; (c) none of the
Parties will have any right of termination under this Agreement as a result of
such Casualty Event; (d) there shall be no adjustment to the Base Purchase
Price pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ as a result of such Casualty Event; and
(e) if the repair or restoration would normally be made by the Seller
Companies in the Ordinary Course of Business, then the applicable Seller
shall, at its election, either (i) repair or restore the Damaged Portion
in the Ordinary Course of Business or (ii) reduce the Base Purchase Price by
the Casualty Loss Amount with respect to such Casualty Event.

7.5.7 If after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent
domain by any Governmental Authority, the Assets or portion thereof shall be
excluded as Excluded Assets to the extent of the interest affected by the
condemnation or right of eminent domain and the Base Purchase Price will be
reduced by the dollar value awarded for the portion of such Assets so taken,
_provided_ that if the dollar value assigned to such Assets exceeds
$100,000,000, then any Party may terminate this Agreement by written notice to
the other. If any action for condemnation or taking under right of eminent
domain is pending or threatened with respect to any Asset or portion thereof
after the date of this Agreement, but no taking of such Asset or portion
thereof occurs prior to the Closing Date, the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement shall nevertheless close and Sellers, at Closing, shall assign,
transfer and set over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of Sellers or their
Affiliates right, title and interest (if any) in such taking, including any
insurance claims, unpaid awards and other rights against Third Parties
arising out of the taking, insofar as they are attributable to the Assets
threatened to be taken.

ARTICLE 8

PRE-CLOSING COVENANTS

 

Section 8.1 _Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent_. From the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this
Agreement, each Party will use Reasonable Efforts to take all action (or
refrain from taking any action within its control) and to do all things
necessary, proper or advisable in order to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the satisfaction
of the conditions precedent set forth in _Article 10_.

 



24 Section 8.2 _Notices and Consents_. Each of the Parties will use its
Reasonable Efforts to give notices to, make filings with, and obtain
authorizations, consents and approvals of any Third Parties (including any
Governmental Authorities), in each case, to the extent necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party shall
cooperate with the other Parties in obtaining such authorizations, consents
and approvals. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 8.2_ releases the Buyer or the Sellers of their
respective obligations under _Section 8.4_ or releases the Buyer of its
obligations under _8.7.1_. Each Party shall provide to the other Party copies
of any such written authorization, consent or approval promptly after it has
been obtained.

Section 8.3 _Cooperation and Efforts With Respect to Transfers of Assets_. 

8.3.1 Buyer acknowledges that certain of the Assets (including Material
Contracts) may be subject to restrictions on transfer and may otherwise not
be readily assignable or transferable. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement of the Sellers (or any Seller Company) to assign any Asset which
is non-transferable, if the attempted assignment of the same, as a result of
the absence of the consent or authorization of a Third Party or failure of a
Preferential Right notice period to expire, would constitute a breach or
Default with respect to such Asset or would violate any applicable Law (a
"Non-Assignable Asset"). Provided a Seller complies with its obligations under
this _Section 8.3.1_, (i) no breach of this Agreement shall be deemed to have
occurred due to such Sellers inability to assign any Non-Assignable Asset
and (ii) such Seller shall have no Liability whatsoever to the Buyer because
of any breach or Default or violation of any applicable Law with respect to
any such Non-Assignable Asset subsequent to the Closing Date arising from
such Sellers compliance with its obligations pursuant to this _Section
8.3.1_. The Parties shall cooperate and use Reasonable Efforts to obtain such
authorizations or consents. If, despite the Parties collective Reasonable
Efforts, any such consent, authorization or waiver necessary to effect the
assignment and assumption is not obtained with respect to any such Non-
Assignable Asset, so that the Buyer would not, in fact, receive all such
rights and assume the obligations, of the applicable Seller Company with
respect thereto as of the Effective Time as they exist prior to such attempted
assignment or assumption, then, subject to  _Section 10.1.6_ and except with
respect to any Assigned Branded Jobber Contracts that are not assigned at
Closing (which will instead result in a Base Purchase Price adjustment in
accordance with _Section 7.3_) , the following provisions shall apply:

8.3.1.1 Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 8.3.1_, (a) the
applicable Seller or the applicable Seller Company shall retain such Non-
Assignable Asset and, to the extent that it is reasonably practicable and that
doing so would not constitute a breach or Default with respect to such Non-
Assignable Asset or violate any applicable Law, use Reasonable Efforts to
provide the Buyer with the benefits in all material respects of such Non-
Assignable Asset, (b) the Buyer shall perform (or cause to be performed),
fulfill and discharge the applicable Sellers or the applicable Seller
Companys obligations with respect to such Non-Assignable Asset arising on or
after the Closing Date at the Buyers sole cost and expense (and the Buyer
shall be deemed to be the applicable Sellers or Seller Companys agent for
such purposes), if and to the extent that it would not constitute a breach or
Default with respect to such Non-Assignable Asset or violate any applicable
Law and the Buyer is provided any benefits thereof, and (c) notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if and to the extent the Buyer is
provided any benefits thereof, the Buyer shall indemnify each Seller
Indemnified Party against all Losses in any manner arising out of,
or relating to or suffered in connection with any arrangement under which a
Seller holds the Non-Assignable Asset and provides to Buyer the benefits of
such Non-Assignable Asset (other than Losses for which such Seller has an
indemnification obligation under _Article 16_ )).

8.3.1.2 With respect to any Non-Assignable Contract, to the extent reasonably
practicable and that it would not constitute a breach or Default under such
Non-Assignable

 



25  Contract or violate any applicable Law, the applicable Seller and the Buyer
shall use Reasonable Efforts to enter into such back-to-back arrangements at
or after the Closing as may be reasonably acceptable to both the Buyer and
such Seller to effect the transfer from such Seller to the Buyer of the
rights, benefits, obligations and burdens of such Non-Assignable Contract in
all material respects (a "Back-to-Back Arrangement"). Any such Back-to-Back
Arrangement shall expressly be made subject to the provisions of this _Section
8.3.1._ Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 8.3.1_, until such
time as such Seller and the Buyer execute and deliver a Back-to-Back
Arrangement, the provisions of _Section 8.3.1.1_ shall apply with respect to
such Non-Assignable Contract;

8.3.1.3 During the period of any arrangement under Section 8.3.1.1 with
respect to a Non-Assignable Asset and the term of any other Back-to-Back
Arrangement, the Buyer and the applicable Seller shall continue to cooperate
and use Reasonable Efforts to obtain such consents, authorizations, or waivers
as necessary to make such assignment to and assumption by the Buyer of such
Non-Assignable Asset effective as soon as practicable after the Closing Date.
If, despite the use of such Reasonable Efforts, the applicable consent,
authorization or waiver necessary to effect the assignment and assumption of
any Non-Assignable Contract is not obtained from the applicable Third Party on
or before the date that is six (6) months after the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall use Reasonable Efforts to replace such Non-Assignable Contract with a
substitute Contract reasonably acceptable to Buyer (and shall keep such Seller
reasonably informed as to the status of such efforts on no less than a
monthly basis), and the Parties obligations under this _Section 8.3.1_
(including any Back-to-Back Arrangement as may have been entered into) shall
expire as of the date that the Buyer executes such replacement Contract
(other than with respect to any of the Parties respective obligations under
this _Section 8.3.1_ accruing or arising prior to such date, which shall
survive until fully performed);

 

8.3.1.4 The applicable Seller may elect in its sole discretion to terminate
any arrangement under _Section 8.3.1.1_ with respect to a Non-Assignable
Contract and any other Back-to-Back Arrangement as of earlier of (a) the date
that the relevant underlying Contract expires at the earliest opportunity in
accordance with its terms (including, for any Contract subject to automatic
or "evergreen" renewals, by terminating such Contract as of the end of the
then-current term without renewal thereof) or (b) the second (2nd) anniversary
of the Closing Date, in each case unless the Buyer demonstrates that such
termination would materially and adversely impact the business of the Buyer
with respect to such Non-Assignable Contract (in which case such Sellers
obligations hereunder with respect to such Non-Assignable Contract shall
expire as of the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Closing Date). The Parties
respective obligations under this _Section 8.3.1_ accruing prior to the date
of such termination or expiration shall survive until fully performed; and

8.3.1.5 The Parties obligations under this _Section 8.3.1_ with respect to
any Non-Assignable Real Property Interest (or any other Non-Assignable Asset
that is not a Non-Assignable Contract) shall expire (other than with respect
to any of the Parties respective obligations under this _Section 8.3._1
accruing or arising prior to such date, which shall survive until fully
performed) as of the earlier of (a) the date such relevant Non-Assignable Real
Property Interest (or such other Non-Assignable Asset that is not a Non-
Assignable Contract) is assigned to the Buyer or the relevant underlying
Contract expires at the earliest opportunity in accordance with its terms, or
is otherwise amended or supplemented to directly provide such benefits and
obligations thereunder to the Buyer or (b) the tenth (10th) anniversary of
the Closing Date.

8.3.2 Prior to the Closing, the Seller Companies may be authorized to
utilize certain "master" contracts and agreements that pertain to multiple
facilities owned by each Seller and its Affiliates (each, a "Multi-Site
Contract" and collectively, the "Multi-Site Contracts").  _Schedule 8.3.2_
contains a true and complete listing of all Multi-Site Contracts that pertain
to the Assets and the Business. With respect to all Multi-Site Contracts, the
Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Buyer 

 



26  shall not be entitled to make use of such Multi-Site Contracts after the
Closing and the Sellers intend to terminate all Multi-Site Contracts as to the
Assets and the Business effective as of Closing. Notwithstanding such
termination, the Business (and therefore the Buyer) shall be obligated to
honor any purchase commitments for materials and equipment made under any
Multi-Site Contracts prior to the Closing, but not yet fully performed or
satisfied as of the Closing, so long as such commitments were not made in
violation of the Sellers obligations under _Section 8.5_ and so long as the
Sellers enforce or cause their respective applicable Affiliates to enforce
for the benefit of the Buyer any corresponding obligations of the
counterparties to any such Multi-Site Contracts. To the extent a Multi-Site
Contract by its terms is not terminable as to the Business, the Buyer
covenants and agrees to negotiate diligently and in good faith with the
counterparty(ies) to such Multi-Site Contract in an effort to enter into a new
agreement between the counterparty(ies) and the Buyer, or its applicable
Affiliate, relating to the Business or the Assets as promptly as possible
following the Closing. The Buyer acknowledges that the terms and conditions of
Multi-Site Contracts that relate to other facilities of each Seller and its
Affiliates other than the Facilities (including rate sheets and
other commercial terms and conditions covering such other facilities) are
confidential and proprietary information of each Seller and its Affiliates,
and such information shall be subject to the confidentiality and use
restrictions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.

8.3.3 Each Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate using its Reasonable Efforts
to transfer, obtain or to cause to be transferred or obtained, as of the
Closing, all Permits necessary for the Buyer to own and operate the Business
and the Assets in substantially the same manner as such Seller operated the
Assets during the twelve (12) month period preceding the Closing, including
those Permits set forth on _Schedule 8.3.3_. With respect to Permits set forth
on _Schedules 15.1.4.1_ and _15.1.7.1(c)_ that are not transferred to Buyer at
Closing, during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and
continuing until one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Closing Date
(which one hundred and eighty (180) day period may be extended in thirty (30)
day increments by mutual agreement of the Buyer and the Sellers, _provided_
that, in no case shall such aggregate period, including any extensions, end
later than the date that is nine (9) months after the Closing Date), (i) the
Sellers and the Buyer shall provide or cause to be provided to the other
Party all commercially reasonable assistance as is reasonably requested in
connection with securing (and/or terminating, if required by applicable Law)
any such Permits; and (ii) if any such Permits are not secured prior to the
Closing, the Sellers and the Buyer shall use Reasonable Efforts to cooperate
in any lawful and reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by the other
Parties under which the Buyer shall obtain the benefits and burdens of
such Permits.

8.3.4 No later than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, each of the
Buyer and BP Products shall execute and deliver to one another duly executed
copies of a letter agreement, substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ (the
"Shipping History Assignment Agreement"), regarding the transfer of certain of
BP Products Terminals Pipeline Rights (with respect to fifty thousand
(50,000) barrels per day of BP Products shipping history developed on the
Colonial Pipeline) to Buyer under Colonial Pipeline Companys FERC oil tariff
98.7.0 as described on  _Schedule 2.1.2.4_. If Colonial Pipeline Company
shall not have granted its consent to such transfer as of the Closing Date,
then the Buyer and BP Products shall continue to pursue such consent from
Colonial Pipeline Company from and after the Closing and, to cover any
interim period, the provisions applicable to the same set forth in the
Amendment to the Exchange Agreement shall apply. Each of Buyer and BP Products
acknowledges and agrees that (a) Colonial Pipeline Company will ultimately
determine whether BP Products has sufficient shipping history, as allocated
among the individual line segments described in the Shipping History
Assignment Agreement, as of the proposed effective date of the requested
transfer and (b) in the event that Colonial Pipeline Company notifies Buyer
and BP Products in response to the request that BP Products does not have a
sufficient historical pattern of shipments for any individual line segment to
satisfy the proposed transfer request with respect to such line segment, the
Parties shall cooperate in good faith to revise the request by increasing the
amount of BP Products actual shipping history allocated to the "Pasadena to
Atlanta-Doraville", "Pasadena to Knoxville", "Pasadena to North Augusta", or
"Pasadena to Charlotte"

 



27  line segments, with the exact allocation per line segment to be mutually
agreed by the Parties at the applicable time, in order to effect a total
transfer of fifty thousand (50,000) barrels per day of shipping history to
Buyer to the extent possible as permitted by Colonial Pipeline Company.

8.3.5 Within thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement, the Sellers
will provide complete copies of all Jobber Outlet Incentive Program ("JOIP")
contracts and agreements identified in Table 2 of _Schedule 2.1.4.1_ , to the
extent in Sellers possession and control, to selected employees or
representatives of the Buyer that have been mutually agreed to by both the
Buyer and the Sellers, (the "Clean Team") for the sole purpose of the Buyer
reviewing and establishing appropriate post Effective Time payment
calculations and procedures. Certain JOIP contracts, which are identified in
Table 2 to _Schedule 2.1.4.1_ , are not being provided to the Clean Team for
review because the Sellers have been unable to locate a copy of the formal
written JOIP contract. With respect to any JOIP contract identified in Table 2
to _Schedule 2.1.4.1_ that is not provided to the Clean Team, the Sellers will
provide the Clean Team with the following information regarding the JOIP
contract or arrangement with the applicable jobber: jobber name, retail
location address to which the JOIP contract relates, contract effective date,
contract type, outstanding JOIP contract balance, payment status, length of
contract in years, contract expiration date, cents per gallon ("CPG")
incentive amount (which is only paid on gasoline and paid semi-annually),
years over which CPG paid, and CPG period end date. Until the earlier to
occur of (i) the expiration or termination of the waiting period referred to
in the HSR Act applicable to the transaction and (ii) the date that is thirty
(30) calendar days prior to the Closing Date, the Clean Team shall not
disclose the contracts, agreements, arrangements or information contained
within them to any other employee of the Buyer without first seeking and
receiving the written consent and approval from the Seller.

taken, all other actions consistent with this _Section 8.4_ necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act (including any extensions thereof) as soon as practicable; and (d)
obtain all other actions or non-actions, approvals, consents, waivers,

8.4.2 Each of the Buyer and the Sellers shall: (a) promptly notify the other
Parties of, and if in writing, furnish the other Party with copies of (or, in

permit the other Parties to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in
good faith any comments made by the other Parties in relation to) any proposed
competition-related, voluntary, written communication to a Governmental
Authority, (b) keep the other Parties informed of any developments, meetings
or discussions with any Governmental Authority in respect of any competition-
related filings, 

 



28  investigation or inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (c) not independently participate in any meeting or discussions
with any Governmental Authority in respect of any competition-related
filings, investigation or inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement without giving the other Parties prior notice of such meeting
or discussions and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the
opportunity to attend or participate. Each of the Buyer and the Sellers may,
however, designate any non-public information provided to any Governmental
Authority as restricted to "Outside Antitrust Counsel" only and any
such information shall not be shared with employees, officers or directors or
their equivalents of the other Parties without approval of the Parties
providing the non-public information.

 

8.4.3 For purposes of this _Section 8.4_, without limiting the foregoing,
each of the Sellers and the Buyer agrees to use its respective Reasonable
Efforts to obtain all clearances, consents, approvals and waivers that may be
required by any competition-related Governmental Authority, so as to enable
the Buyer and the Sellers to close the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as soon as practicable (and in any event no later than the
Long-Stop Date).

8.4.4 In the event that any Proceeding that seeks to prohibit, prevent, or
restrict the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is actually
threatened or commenced and such Proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be
expected to seek, to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the
Sellers and the Buyer shall use its respective Reasonable Efforts to avoid or
resolve any such Proceeding and each of the Buyer and the Sellers shall
cooperate with the others and use its respective Reasonable Efforts to
contest and resist any such Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed
or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

8.4.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this Agreement,
(a) no Party will be required to pay any consideration (except filing and
application fees) to any other Person from whom any consents, approvals or
authorizations are requested pursuant to this _Section 8.4_, and (b) neither
the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall be required, in connection with the
matters covered by this _Section 8.4_, to (i) commence litigation (as opposed
to defend litigation) or maintain such litigation once commenced, (ii) agree
to any restrictions on, or modifications of, the operation or conduct of their
existing business or any future business activities, whether absolute or
conditional; (iii) agree to divest, hold separate (by trust or otherwise) or
surrender control of any of their current assets or businesses, whether in
whole or in part and whether absolutely or conditionally; (iv) agree to any

the earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement, the

Assets and the Business for acquisition by the Buyer and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Sellers will
not, and will cause the Seller Companies and the Cogen Company to
not, without the prior written consent of the Buyer (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) or except for such actions
as may be undertaken to separate the Assets and the Business from the Seller
Companies and their Affiliates and otherwise transition and prepare the

confidentiality restrictions subject to the Seller Companies global data
privacy policies regarding data related to employees. Any information obtained

contemplated under this Agreement, except where it has received the prior
written consent of such Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 8.7_
shall not limit or otherwise restrict the Buyer or its Affiliates from
contacting or having business dealings with any such Person with whom the
Buyer or such Affiliate has or may have business dealings, so long as such
contact or business dealings relate to the Buyers or its Affiliates
operation of their business and not to any Sellers or its Affiliates
business dealings with such Person with respect to the Business or the Assets
or with respect to any aspect of the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement.

32  identified in _Schedule 8.7.2(a)_ between signing and the Effective Time
relating to any other event, circumstance or Liability, besides the QQQ Issue,

faith judgment at the time such contact is initiated, would reasonably likely
result in a Liability to any Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to this
Agreement will be conducted in accordance with the protocols indicated in
_Schedule 8.7.2(b)_ ; provided, however, that Buyer shall promptly notify such
Seller if, during any such contact, the Governmental Authority indicates that

would reasonably likely result in a Liability to Buyer or its Affiliates
pursuant to this Agreement will be conducted in accordance with the protocols
indicated in _Schedule 8.7.2(b)_ ; provided, however, that such Seller shall
promptly notify Buyer if, during any such contact, the Governmental Authority

unable to and does not deliver to the applicable beneficiary an acceptable
Substitute Credit Support Arrangement and/or is unable to obtain a release of

Seller at the relevant time. From and after the Effective Time, the Buyer
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless such Seller and its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives, from and against any and all Losses

any Credit Support Arrangement without liability to Buyer. 

8.8.2 For any Credit Support Arrangement maintained by any Seller after the

Section 8.14 _Title and Surveys_.

 

8.14.1 _Refinery, Cogen Company and Terminals Real Property_. Buyer and
Sellers acknowledge that, except as expressly provided in this _Section
8.14_ and subject to Sellers delivery of the executed Title Certificates to
the Title Company, all issues relating to title to the Refinery Owned Real
Property and the Cogen Company Leased Real Property, which are reflected in
the ascribed real estate folders in the Data Room or in the Refinery Title
Commitments as of the date of this Agreement, were addressed and resolved by
Buyer and Sellers prior to the date of this Agreement and that Buyer will
be precluded from making any claim against the Seller or its Affiliates with
respect to title to the Refinery Owned Real Property and the Cogen Company
Leased Real Property.

8.14.1.1 _Title Commitments_.

(a) BP Products has caused the Title Company to prepare and issue title
commitments with respect to the Refinery Owned Real Property and the Cogen
Company Leased Real Property (together with any updates thereto, the "Refinery
Title 

 



35  Commitments"). Each of the Refinery Title Commitments sets forth the Title
Companys report of the state of title to the applicable real property fee or
leasehold interest, together with all exceptions or conditions to such title
which are of record or otherwise known to the Title Company, including all
Encumbrances, if any, affecting the applicable real property interests, which
may appear in a Title Policy, if issued. The copies of the underlying
documents evidencing or creating the exceptions and conditions set forth in
the Refinery Title Commitments shall be provided by the Title Company or BP
Products through the electronic data rooms maintained by Sellers (the "Data
Room") or through SureClose electronic access maintained by the Title Company
and shall include the most legible copies available of all such exceptions and
conditions shown therein (the "Refinery Title Exception Documents").

(b) BP Products has caused the Title Company to issue title commitments
with respect to the Terminals Owned Real Property (together with any updates
thereto, the "Terminals Title Commitments"), which Terminals Title Commitments
set forth the Title Companys report of the state of title to the
applicable real property fee, together with all exceptions or conditions to
such title which are of record or otherwise known to the Title Company,
including all Encumbrances, if any, affecting the applicable real property
interests, which may appear in a Title Policy, if issued. The copies of the
underlying documents evidencing or creating the exceptions and conditions set
forth in the Terminals Title Commitments shall be provided by the Title
Company or BP Products through the Data Room or through the SureClose
electronic access maintained by the Title Company and shall include the most
legible copies available of all such exceptions and conditions shown therein
(the "Terminals Title Exception Documents").

 

(c) The cost of any title commitment and any Title Policy issued for the
benefit of Buyer shall be paid one-half (1/2) by Buyer and one-half (1/2) by
Sellers.

8.14.1.2 _Surveys_.

 

(a) BP Products has delivered to Buyer, or otherwise provided to Buyer through
the Data Room, a boundary survey of the Refinery Owned Real Property within
the boundaries of the Refinery, which survey does not include the off-site
Refinery Owned Real Property known as the Green Belt, Landfarm, Hurricane
Levee, TWC and Malone properties (the "Refinery Survey"). The cost of such
Refinery Survey incurred prior to the date hereof shall be borne by Sellers.
The cost of any modifications or updates to the Refinery Survey which are
mutually agreed to by both Buyer and Seller shall be paid one-half (1/2) by
Buyer and one-half (1/2) by Sellers and the resulting survey is herein called
the "Updated Refinery Survey". If, within thirty (30) days after the execution
of this Agreement, Buyer elects to obtain a boundary survey of the Green
Belt, Landfarm, Hurricane Levee, TWC and Malone properties (such tracts are
herein called the "Ancillary Tracts" and the boundary survey of the Ancillary
Tracts is herein called the "Ancillary Tracts Survey"), Seller and Buyer each
agree to pay one-half (1/2) of the cost of the Ancillary Tracts Survey, and
the obligation of each party to pay its share of the cost of the Ancillary
Tracts Survey shall survive the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, delivery of any Updated Refinery Survey
or any Ancillary Tracts Survey shall not be a condition to either partys
obligation to consummate the transactions covered by this Agreement and shall
not permit either party to delay the Closing because any Updated Refinery
Survey or any Ancillary Tracts Survey has not been completed or delivered.

 

(b) BP Products shall, prior to Closing, obtain new boundary surveys for each
of the Terminals Owned Real Property (the "Terminals Surveys"). All Terminals
Surveys shall be prepared by a licensed surveyor or professional engineer
qualified to

 



36  conduct surveys in the state where the property being surveyed is located.
All Terminals Surveys shall distinguish and clearly label each separate parcel
that comprises the Terminals Owned Real Property. The cost of each such
Terminals Survey, and any modifications thereto agreed upon by Buyer and
Seller, shall be paid one-half (1/2) by Buyer and one-half (1/2) by Sellers.

 

(c) Any Updated Refinery Survey and the Terminal Surveys will be posted by
Sellers in the real estate folders in the Data Room and Seller will give
notice to Buyer designating the exact folder numbers in which such surveys
have been posted within two (2) Business Days after such surveys have been
posted. In the event that Buyer and Sellers are not able to mutually agree as
to any modifications or updates to the Refinery Survey or the Terminal
Surveys, either party shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to
cause the surveyor to incorporate such modification or update to the Refinery
Survey or the Terminal Surveys, as applicable.

8.14.1.3 _Buyer s Title Objections_.

 

(a) With respect to each Terminal Owned Real Property, within sixty (60) days
after delivery by BP Products of the Terminals Title Commitment and the
Terminals Survey for such Terminal Owned Real Property (whichever shall be
provided later), Buyer shall furnish BP Products written notice with respect
to such location setting forth all title defects, Encumbrances (other than
Permitted Encumbrances) or other matters (excluding the failure to obtain any
third-party consent required under any Real Property Lease, which consents are
addressed under other provisions of this Agreement and excluding matters
which constitute Permitted Encumbrances) which Buyer requests that BP
Products cure ("Terminals Title Defects"). Except as expressly provided for
herein, matters shown on the Terminals Surveys or contained in the Terminals
Title Commitments to which Buyer does not object within the prescribed sixty
(60) day period shall be deemed to be Permitted Encumbrances.

(b) With respect to any update of a title commitment which was issued with
respect to the Refinery Owned Real Property or Cogen Company Leased Real
Property after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time and which sets forth new exceptions to title not previously disclosed in
such prior title commitment, within fourteen (14) days after delivery by BP
Products of such updated title commitment, Buyer shall furnish BP Products
written notice with respect to such location, but only with respect to new
exceptions to title, setting forth all title defects, Encumbrances (other than
Permitted Encumbrances) or other matters (excluding the failure to obtain
any third-party consent required under any Real Property Lease, which
consents are addressed under other provisions of this Agreement and excluding
matters which constitute Permitted Encumbrances) which Buyer requests that BP
Products cure ("Post-Signing Title Defects"; and Post-Signing Title Defects,
together with the Terminals Title Defects, shall collectively be referred to
herein as, "Title Defects"). Except as expressly provided for herein,
new exceptions to title not previously disclosed on a prior title commitment
shown on any update to a title commitment which was issued with respect to the
Refinery Owned Real Property, Cogen Company Leased Real Property or the
Terminal Owned Real Property to which Buyer does not object within the
prescribed fourteen (14) day period shall be deemed Permitted Encumbrances.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none
of the following shall be a Title Defect: (i) any matter, including a new
title exception in any title commitment, relating to the Ancillary Tracts or
(ii) any matter, including a new title exception in any title commitment,
relating to the Refinery Owned Real Property or the

 



37  Cogen Company Leased Property resulting from any Updated Refinery Survey or
any Ancillary Tracts Survey.

8.14.1.4 _Seller s Rights to Cure and Permitted Encumbrances_. BP Products
shall have until any time on or prior to Closing, at its sole cost and
expense, if it so elects, to cure all or a portion of such asserted Title
Defects. Any asserted Title Defects which are waived (in writing) by Buyer or
cured within such time to Buyers satisfaction shall be deemed Permitted
Encumbrances. Any Title Defect which individually involves less than three
hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) to remedy shall be deemed to be waived by
Buyer and to be a Permitted Encumbrance; _provided_ that, any Title Defects
which relate to a valid and currently existing and enforceable option
to purchase, right of first offer or right of first refusal vested in a Third
Party with respect to the Real Property or lack of access to or from the Real
Property shall each not be subject to the three hundred thousand dollars
($300,000) minimum threshold and shall not be deemed a Permitted Encumbrance.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, BP Products shall have no obligation to remedy
a Title Defect, and Buyer shall have no right to receive a reduction of the
Base Purchase Price, as set forth in  _Section 8.14.1.5_ or any other remedy
afforded to Buyer under this Agreement, if such Title Defect is a Permitted
Encumbrance.

8.14.1.5 _Uncured Title Defects_. Except as provided for in _Section
8.14.1.4_ and only if the subject Title Defect exceeds the Title Defect
thresholds in _Section 8.14.1.4_ above, if BP Products is either unwilling
or unable to cure any Title Defect, Buyer may elect, on a property-by-property
basis, to receive a reduction of the Base Purchase Price in an amount equal to
the lesser of (i) the amount necessary to cure such Title Defect or (ii) the
reduction in the fair market value of the property or properties affected by
any such Title Defect, as reasonably determined by BP Products and agreed to
by Buyer (such amount, the "Title Defect Amount"). If Buyer and BP Products
disagree over the determination of the amount to cure any Title Defect with
respect to any parcel of property or the reduction in fair market value
attributable to any Title Defect on the subject property, Buyer and BP
Products shall use Reasonable Efforts to resolve such disagreement within ten
(10) Business Days. To the extent the foregoing resolution of any such
reduction in the Base Purchase Price with respect to a property cannot
be accomplished prior to Closing, Buyer may withhold one-half of the proposed
reduction in the Base Purchase Price at Closing and the Parties shall resolve
such issue post-Closing. Upon such resolution Buyer or BP Products shall make
a payment to the other to reflect the Finally Determined reduction, if any.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.14.1.5_, Buyer
shall be permitted at any time prior to and after Closing to work with the
Title Company and/or any surveyor to remove, insure around, revise or
otherwise modify any matter shown on any title commitment or survey,
regardless of whether such matter is a Permitted Encumbrance, an uncured Title
Defect, or any other matter affecting the subject property without waiving
any of its rights under this _Section 8.14.1.5_.

8.14.1.6 _Cooperative Effort in Obtaining Title Policies_. If the Buyer and
BP Products had an unresolved Title Defect at Closing for which one-half of
the proposed resolution amount was withheld at Closing, then Buyer and BP
Products will cooperate for a period of six (6) months following Closing to
resolve such dispute pursuant to _Section 20.11_, _provided_ that the Finally
Determined reduction in the Base Purchase Price attributable to such Title
Defect will not exceed the aggregate proposed deduction (and not just the
portion retained by Buyer) for such Title Defect that was applied by the Buyer
and BP Products at the Closing.

8.14.1.7 _Cooperative Effort in Obtaining Title Policies_. The Sellers shall
cooperate with the Buyer in the Buyers efforts to acquire Title Policies with
respect to the Owned Real Property and the Cogen Company Leased Real
Property, including, if required by the Title Company, by entering into the
Title Certificates and such other standard title certificates as are
acceptable to the Title Company and Sellers, in order to issue
Title Policies.

 



38 Section 8.15 _FCC Licenses for the Refinery_. At the Closing, Buyer and
BP Products will enter into a Radio Tower Sharing Agreement substantially in
the form of _Exhibit D_ hereto (the "Radio Tower Sharing Agreement"), which
will provide for (i) the joint use of the radio tower located on the
BP Chemicals site and currently used in the Refinery Business and the
respective businesses of BP Chemicals and Styrolutions, (ii) the process for
the modification of the FCC Licenses relating to the Refining Business (FCC
License No. WPAH364) and creation of new FCC license in the name of Buyer
with certain assigned frequencies, and (iii) provide for a transition plan
such that when Buyer has completed its construction of a new radio tower
located at the Refinery, which will provide radio communication services
required by the Refinery Business, the new FCC license can then be modified to
transfer it to the new tower. The Terms and conditions of the Radio Tower
Sharing Agreement shall control in all matters associated with FCC License
No. WPAH364.

Section 8.16 _Operatorship as of the Closing_. Subject to the terms of the
Transition Services Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Buyer shall assume
all responsibilities of the operator of record of each of the pipelines in the
Texas Pipelines System to the extent such pipelines and the related assets
included in the Texas Pipelines System have been transferred to Buyer,
including for all operations, maintenance, repair, expansion, and management
activities (including all emergency response and regulatory compliance)
thereof.

 

Section 8.17 _Related Person Transactions_. On or prior to the Closing Date,
the Sellers shall have terminated or caused to be terminated all agreements
with Related Persons that are enumerated in _Schedule 15.1.14_.

Section 8.18  _Retail Assigned Contracts_. Seller agrees to use Reasonable
Efforts to preserve the business relationships with the branded jobbers who
are parties to the Assigned Branded Jobber Contracts, including using
Reasonable Efforts to cause such Assigned Branded Jobber Contracts that
expire between signing and the Effective Time to be renewed consistent with
the Ordinary Course of Business; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, BP Products is not prohibited from terminating an Assigned Branded
Jobber Contract as permitted by the provisions of _Schedule 7.3.2_.

Section 8.19 _Proceedings filed against Sellers and Buyer_. If any Proceeding
is filed by any Third Party after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time against both a Seller Company and Buyer arising solely out of a
public announcement of this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents or,
subject to _Section 5.1.4_, any Proceeding is filed by any Third Party after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time against either a
Seller Company or Buyer (but not both) arising solely out of a public
announcement of this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents and Buyer
or any Seller Company, as the case may be, is later joined as a party to said
Proceeding (the "Joint Proceedings"), Sellers and Buyer shall each pay fifty
percent (50%) of the costs of defense of any such Joint Proceeding. All Losses
ultimately resulting from a Joint Proceeding will be apportioned between
Sellers and Buyer in accordance with the terms of the final resolution or
settlement of the Joint Proceeding and as Finally Determined in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement.

and such parties shall enter into a mutual release agreement, with each of
such parties being released of any

POST-CLOSING BASE PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS

Section 12.1 _Base Purchase Price Adjustments_.

12.1.1 On or within two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, BP
Products shall cause to be taken a measurement of the Hydrocarbon Inventory
as of the Effective Time and shall cause a valuation of such Hydrocarbon
Inventory as of the Effective Time (the "Closing Hydrocarbon Inventory Value")
to be undertaken and calculated pursuant to the procedures set forth on
_Schedule 12.1.1_.

12.1.2 On or within two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, BP
Products shall cause to be taken a measurement of the Non-Hydrocarbon
Inventory as of the Effective Time and shall cause a valuation of such Non-
Hydrocarbon Inventory as of the Effective Time (the "Closing Non-Hydrocarbon
Inventory Value") to be undertaken and calculated pursuant to the procedures
set forth on _Schedule 12.1.2_.

12.1.3 [Intentionally Omitted.]

 



47 12.1.4 (a) The Buyer and each Seller agree that all of the items listed on
_Schedule 12.1.4(a)_ relating to the Business or operation of the Assets
(such items and such other payments, the "Prorated Payments") shall be
prorated as of the Effective Time, with the Sellers liable to the extent the
Prorated Payments relate to any time period prior to the Effective Time and
the Buyer liable to the extent the Prorated Payments relate to any time period
on (including those Prorated Payments arising as a result of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and after the Effective
Time (in each case, measured in the same units used to compute the Prorated
Payment in question, or otherwise measured by calendar days). The Prorated
Payments relating to a time period shall be based on the number of days in
the actual year or other appropriate period (i) before the Effective Time and
(ii) including and after the Effective Time. The Sellers and the Buyer agree
to furnish each other with such documents and other records as may be
reasonably requested in order to confirm all Prorated Payments calculations
made in accordance with this _Section 12.1.4_.

 

(b) Following the Closing Date, the Sellers shall prepare the Sellers
calculation of the actual Net Prorated Amount as of the Effective Time (the
"Closing Net Prorated Amount").

Section 12.2 _Closing Statement_. On or within ninety (90) days following the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall deliver to the Buyer a closing statement (the
"Closing Statement") that will set forth the following (each, a "Closing
Adjustment Amount"):

12.2.1 the Closing Hydrocarbon Inventory Value;

 

12.2.2 the Closing Non-Hydrocarbon Inventory Value; and

12.2.3 the Closing Net Prorated Amount.

Section 12.3 _Resolution of Disputes with respect to the Closing Statement_.

12.3.1 If the Buyer fails to object to any portion of the Closing Hydrocarbon
Inventory Value, Closing Non-Hydrocarbon Inventory Value or Closing Net
Prorated Amount within sixty (60) days following the Buyers receipt of the
Closing Statement from the Sellers, then such portion of the applicable
Closing Adjustment Amounts not objected to shall be final and binding upon
the Sellers and the Buyer.

12.3.2 If the Buyer disagrees with any portion of the Closing Adjustment
Amounts reflected on the Closing Statement, then the Buyer must notify the
Sellers in writing of such disagreement within sixty (60) days following the
Buyers receipt of the Closing Statement by setting forth the Buyers
calculation of the disputed portion of such Closing Adjustment Amount (the
"Disputed Closing Adjustment Amounts"), and describing the basis for such
disagreement (such notification, an "Objection Notice"). If an Objection
Notice is timely delivered to the Sellers, then the Buyer and the Sellers
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve their disagreements with respect to
any Disputed Closing Adjustment Amounts. In the event that the Buyer and the
Sellers are unable to resolve all such disagreements within thirty (30) days
after the Sellers receipt of any such Objection Notice, either the Buyer or
the Sellers may at any time thereafter submit such remaining disagreements to
the Independent Accountants. If the parties cannot agree within five (5) days
on a single impartial accountant to serve as the Independent Accounts, then BP
Products and Buyer will each nominate an impartial accountant to serve as an
Independent Accountant, and the two Independent Accountants so designated
shall select a third impartial accountant to serve as the third Independent
Accountant.

 



48 12.3.3 The Buyer and the Sellers shall use Reasonable Efforts to cause the
Independent Accountants, once appointed, to resolve all remaining
disagreements with respect to the calculation of the Disputed Closing
Adjustment Amounts as soon as practicable, but in any event shall direct the
Independent Accountants to render a determination within thirty (30) days
after retention of the Independent Accountants. The Independent Accountants
shall consider only those items and amounts in the Buyers and the Sellers
respective calculations of the Closing Adjustment Amounts that are identified
as being items and amounts to which the Buyer and the Sellers have been unable
to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accountants may not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by any Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by
any Party. The Independent Accountants determination of the Disputed Closing
Adjustment Amount shall be based solely on written materials submitted by the
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand ( _i.e._ , not on
independent review), and on the definitions included in this Agreement and the
calculation methodologies set forth on _Schedules 12.1.1_ and  _12.1.2_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Independent Accountants will have no
authority to interpret any provision of this Agreement and any and all
disputes regarding the interpretation or meaning of any provision of this
Agreement will be resolved pursuant to _Section 20.11_. The determination of
the Independent Accountants shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties
and shall not be subject to appeal or further review.

 

12.3.4 The costs and expenses of the Independent Accountants in determining
any Disputed Closing Adjustment Amount shall be borne by the Buyer, on the
one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which
the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the
amount actually contested by such Party. For example, if the Buyer claims
the Closing Hydrocarbon Inventory Value is $1,000 less than the amount
determined by BP Products, and BP Products contests only $500 of the amount
claimed by the Buyer, and if the Independent Accountants ultimately resolve
the dispute by awarding the Buyer $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs
and expenses of the Independent Accountants will be allocated sixty percent
(60%) ( _i.e._ , 300 ÷ 500) to BP Products and forty percent (40%) ( _i.e._ ,
200 ÷ 500) to the Buyer. In connection with their determination of any
Disputed Closing Adjustment Amount, the Independent Accountants shall,
pursuant to the terms of this _Section 12.3.4_, also determine the allocation
of its fees and expenses between the Buyer and the Sellers, which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties and shall,
except in the event of manifest error, not be subject to appeal or further
review.

 

Section 12.4 _Payment of Adjustment Amounts._

12.4.1 Within ten (10) Business Days after any final Closing Adjustment Amount
is determined by mutual agreement of the Buyer and the Sellers or pursuant to
the procedures in  _Section 12.3_, the Buyer shall make a payment to the
Sellers, or the Sellers shall make a payment to the Buyer, as applicable, with
respect to such final Closing Adjustment Amount, in accordance with the
following payment instructions: 

(a) With respect to the Closing Hydrocarbon Inventory Value, either the Buyer
shall pay to BP Products the amount by which the final Closing Hydrocarbon
Inventory Value exceeds the Estimated Hydrocarbon Inventory Value or BP
Products shall pay to the Buyer the amount by which the Estimated Hydrocarbon
Inventory Value exceeds the final Closing Hydrocarbon Inventory Value;

(b) With respect to the Closing Non-Hydrocarbon Inventory Value, either the
Buyer shall pay to BP Products the amount by which the final Closing Non-
Hydrocarbon Inventory Value exceeds the Estimated Non-Hydrocarbon Inventory
Value or BP Products shall pay to the Buyer the amount by which the Estimated
Non-Hydrocarbon Inventory Value exceeds the final Closing Non-Hydrocarbon
Inventory Value; and

 



49 (c) With respect to the Closing Net Prorated Amount, either the Buyer
shall pay to the Sellers the amount by which the final Closing Net Prorated
Amount exceeds the Estimated Net Prorated Amount or the Sellers shall pay to
the Buyer the amount by which the Estimated Net Prorated Amount exceeds the
final Closing Net Prorated Amount;

_provided_ , _however_ , that, if more than one final Closing Adjustment
Amount is concurrently determined by mutual agreement of the Buyer and the
Sellers or pursuant to the procedures in _Section 12.3_, then the Buyer shall
make one net payment to the Sellers, or the Sellers shall make one net payment
to the Buyer, as applicable, with respect to all such final Closing
Adjustment Amounts in accordance with the preceding payment instructions.

12.4.2 The amounts paid by the Buyer or by the Sellers pursuant to this
_Section 12.4_ shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to such account or accounts of the Seller (as may be designated by such Seller
in writing) or of the Buyer (as may be designated by the Buyer in writing),
as the case may be. Buyer shall be entitled to rely on the instructions of any
one Seller and such instructions shall bind all Sellers. The amounts paid by
the Buyer or by the Sellers pursuant to this _Section 12.4_ shall bear
interest from and including the Closing Date to, but excluding, the date of
payment at a rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate. Such interest shall be
payable at the same time as the payments to which it relates and shall
be calculated on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty-five (365) days
and the actual number of days for which it is due.

Section 12.5 _Access_. In order for the Sellers to prepare and the Buyer to
review the Closing Statement and Closing Adjustment Amounts, each of the
Sellers and the Buyer shall permit the other Parties and its Representatives
to have reasonable access to such Partys (a) books, records and other
documents (including work papers, schedules, financial statements, memoranda,
etc.) pertaining to or necessary for the Sellers preparation of the Closing
Statement or the Buyers review of the Closing Adjustment Amounts and provide
such other Party with copies thereof, and (b) employees and accountants
involved in preparation of the Closing Statement, in each case, as reasonably
requested by such other Party.

necessary (as determined by the Buyer and such Seller in good faith) to
operate the assets and businesses described on _Schedule 13.6.1_ at

 



52  Closing and post-Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Sellers access

manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with each others or their
Affiliates respective use of such Easement as applicable. Buyer and each

Section 13.9 _Environmental Control Bonds_.

13.9.1 The Buyer acknowledges that the construction and equipment of the
environmental facilities listed on _Schedule 13.9.1(a)_ (collectively the
"Environmental Facilities"), which are included in the Assets, were financed
with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the $189 million tax-exempt
bonds listed on _Schedule 13.9.1(b)_ (such bonds, the "Environmental Control
Bonds"). In connection with the issuance of the Environmental Control Bonds,
BP Products and/or its Affiliates entered into certain agreements as to the
use of the Environmental Facilities, designed to maintain the tax exempt
status of the interest on the Environmental Control Bonds.

 

13.9.2 Liabilities arising under the Environmental Control Bonds are not being
assumed by the Buyer and shall be retained by BP Products and its Affiliates,
except to the extent such Liabilities result from the Buyers failure to
comply with its obligations under this _Section 13.9_. The Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that BP Products and its Affiliates reserve the right, in BP
Products or its relevant Affiliates sole discretion, to retire, at any time,
any or all of the Environmental Control Bonds. Buyer shall have no obligation
to assure compliance with any arbitrage or rebate provisions of 

 



53  Section 148 of the Code with respect to the Environmental Control Bonds or
to provide for the payment of any principal, interest, redemption price,
tender price, cost of remedial action, counsel fees, issuer fees, trustee
fees, loss of financial benefit or the costs of any Internal Revenue Service
examination of, the Environmental Control Bonds, provided nothing herein shall
be construed to limit Buyers Liability for failure to fulfill such
obligations under _Sections 13.9.3_ and _13.9.4_ below. The Buyer is
obligated to fulfill Buyers obligations under _Sections 13.9.3_ and _13.9.4_
only during the time periods specified in such sections. The Buyer is not
liable for the taxability of the Environmental Control Bonds except to the
extent it results from Buyers failure to comply with its obligations under
this _Section 13.9_.

 

13.9.3 The Buyer hereby covenants and agrees that from and after the Effective
Time, for any period that the Buyer continues to operate, or have operated on

Section 16.4 _Limitations of Liability_. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything herein provided to the contrary:

16.4.1 _De Minimis Amounts_. No Buyer Indemnified Party shall make any claim
for indemnification under _Section 16.2.1_ or _Section 16.2.4_ (excluding a
claim relating to the Fundamental Representations, which shall not be subject
to or limited by the provisions of this _Section 16.4.1_) (a) with respect to
any occurrence or matter (or any series of related occurrences or matters,
which may be in the form of a class action proceeding) relating to the
Refinery Assets, the Refinery Business, the Cogen Company Interests, the Cogen
Company Business or the Cogen Company Assets that involves total Losses of
less than three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) (the "Refinery De Minimis
Amount") arising out of the same occurrence or matter (or any series of
related occurrences or matters, which may be in the form of a class action
proceeding), or (b) with respect to any occurrence or matter (or any series
of related occurrences or matters, which may be in the form of a class action
proceeding) relating to the Non-Refinery Assets that involves total Losses of
less than one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) (the "Non-Refinery De
Minimis Amount") arising out of the same occurrence or matter (or any series
of related occurrences or matters) (for the avoidance of doubt, and without
limiting the foregoing, as used in this  _Section 16.4.1_, "any series of
related occurrences or matters" includes the Losses of all class members whose
claims arise out of related occurrences or matters, which would otherwise
support an indemnification claim under this Agreement);

16.4.2 _Threshold Amounts_. No indemnification shall be payable to any Buyer
Indemnified Party pursuant to  _Section 16.2.1_ or _Section 16.2.4_
(excluding claims relating to the Title Representations or the Fundamental
Representations, which shall not be subject to or limited by the provisions of
this _Section 16.4.2_) (a) with respect to any occurrence or matter relating
to the Refinery Business, the Refinery Assets, the Cogen Company Business, the
Cogen Company Interests or the Cogen Company Assets, unless and until the
total of all Losses for which the Sellers would otherwise have an
indemnification obligation under _Sections 16.2.1_ and _16.2.4_ exceeds ten
million dollars ($10,000,000) in the aggregate (the "Refinery Threshold
Amount"), whereupon the Buyer Indemnified Party may claim indemnification
only for the amount of such Losses, or portion thereof, in excess of such
Refinery Threshold Amount, or (b) with respect to any occurrence or matter
relating to the Non-Refinery Assets, unless and until the total of all Losses
for which the Sellers would otherwise have an indemnification obligation under
_Sections 16.2.1_ and _16.2.4_ exceeds three million dollars ($3,000,000) in
the aggregate (the "Non-Refinery Threshold Amount"), whereupon the Buyer
Indemnified Party may claim indemnification only for the amount of such
Losses, or portion thereof, in excess of such Non-Refinery Threshold Amount.
For the avoidance of doubt, and subject to  _Section 16.4.7_, if the amount
of Losses with respect to an occurrence or matter (or series of related
occurrences or matters) exceeds the Refinery De Minimis Amount or Non-Refinery
De Minimis amount, as applicable, the Buyer Indemnified Party may apply the
total of all such Losses in determining whether the Refinery Threshold Amount
or Non-Refinery Threshold has been met;

 



74 16.4.3 _Refinery Covered Remediation Indemnities_.

 

16.4.3.1 Subject to _Sections 16.4.1_, _16.4.3.2_ and _16.4.7_ , if a Seller
becomes obligated to indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section
16.2.4_ with respect to any Environmental Liability for Remedial Work relating
to contamination of the surface, subsurface soil or groundwater at the
Refinery Real Property (a "Refinery Covered Remediation Indemnity"), the
amount of such Refinery Covered Remediation Indemnity obligation for which the
Seller may be liable shall, without limiting the obligations of the Sellers
for any Liability other than a Refinery Covered Remediation Indemnity, be
limited to the amount of Losses attributable to such Refinery Covered
Remediation Indemnity _multiplied by_ a percentage determined by the date on
which the Refinery Covered Remediation Indemnity was first duly asserted in
writing against the Indemnifying Party by a Buyer Indemnified Party prior to
the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date as set forth below;

unless and until the total of all Losses for which the Sellers would otherwise
have an indemnification obligation for Refinery Covered Remediation
Indemnities exceeds ten million dollars ($10,000,000) in the aggregate (the
"Refinery Covered Remediation Indemnity Threshold Amount"), whereupon the
Buyer Indemnified Party may claim indemnification only for the amount of such
Losses, or portion thereof, in excess of such Refinery Covered Remediation
Indemnity Threshold Amount and in accordance with _Section 16.4.1_,
_provided_ that (i) the Refinery Covered Remediation Indemnity Threshold
Amount is independent from the Refinery Threshold Amount and (ii) amounts
applied against either such threshold amount shall not be applied against the
other threshold amount;

16.4.4 _Refinery Non-Specific Event Pre-Closing Third Party Claims_. Subject
to _Section 16.4.7_, in the event of an indemnification claim pursuant to
_Section 16.2.5_ respecting a Refinery Non-Specific Event Pre-Closing Third
Party Claim, the amount of the indemnity obligation of the Sellers with
respect to such Refinery Non-Specific Event Pre-Closing Third Party Claim

determined by the earlier of the date on which written notice given by the
Non-Governmental Third Party was received by the Seller Companies,
a Proceeding was filed against the Seller Companies by the Non-Governmental
Third Party or a claim was first duly asserted in writing against the
Indemnifying Party by a Buyer Indemnified Party prior to the tenth (10th)

Cogen Company Business or the Cogen Company Assets that is not covered by 
_Section 16.4.3_ or _Section 16.4.4_ (an "Other Refinery Environmental
Claim"), the amount of the indemnity obligation of the Sellers with respect to
such Other Refinery Environmental Claim shall be limited to the aggregate
Losses attributable to such Other Refinery Environmental Claim multiplied by a
percentage determined by the date on which a claim was first duly asserted in
writing against the Indemnifying Party by a Buyer Indemnified Party prior
to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date as set forth below;

16.4.7 _Caps_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein, in no
event will the aggregate indemnification obligations of the Sellers (a) under
_Sections 16.2.1_, _16.2.4_ , _16.2.5_ and _16.2.7_ (other than for breaches
of Title Representations or Fundamental Representations) exceed (i)
with respect to any occurrence or matter relating to the Refinery Business,
the Refinery Assets, the Cogen Company Interests, the Cogen Company Business
or Cogen Company Assets, five hundred million 

 



76  dollars ($500,000,000) and (ii) with respect to any occurrence or matter
relating to the Non-Refinery Assets, forty million dollars ($40,000,000); and
(b) under  _Section 16.2.7_ exceed twenty million dollars ($20,000,000),
such amount being a subset of and applying against the forty million dollars
($40,000,000) liability cap with respect to Non-Refinery Assets;

 

16.4.8 No Buyer Indemnified Party may assert a claim for indemnification
hereunder with respect to Losses resulting from or arising out of, or
attributable to, the coming into force of, or the change in, any applicable
Law, including any applicable Environmental Law or Permit (including any new
or modified cleanup standard or requirement for Remedial Work), on or after
the Effective Time;

16.4.9 No Buyer Indemnified Party may assert a claim for indemnification
hereunder to the extent the Losses result from or arise out of, or are
attributable to any soil, ground water, surface water or soil gas sampling,
surveys, investigations, explorations, laboratory analysis or testing which
any Buyer Indemnified Party voluntarily undertakes after the Effective Time,
excluding any such sampling, surveys, investigations, explorations, laboratory
analysis or testing that are (i) required by any Environmental Law or the
unsolicited direction of any Governmental Authority; (ii) performed during
any renovation, reconstruction or expansion of any machinery, equipment,
fixtures, structures or buildings at any of the Facilities or Real Property
conducted by the Buyer Indemnified Party in the Ordinary Course of Business,
(iii) necessary to defend a claim by a Third Party made against the Buyer or
its Affiliates or to prosecute a previously noticed valid claim for
indemnification under this Agreement, or (iv) required to be performed by or
on behalf of the Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with its Assumed
Liabilities under the Refinery Consent Decrees and Orders; _provided_ that the
Parties acknowledge that meetings by the Buyer with Governmental Authorities
conducted in compliance with _Section 16.4.10_ below shall not constitute a
solicitation of action by a Governmental Authority;

16.4.10 No Buyer Indemnified Party may assert a claim for indemnification
hereunder to the extent the Losses result from or arise out of, or are
attributable to Environmental Liabilities discovered by a Governmental
Authority as a proximate result of an authorized officer or employee of
Buyer or Buyers Affiliates voluntary notifications to, or voluntary
communications or interactions with such Governmental Authority on or after
the Effective Time, unless (a) the Buyer Indemnified Party, in making such
notification, communication or interaction complied in all material respects
with the provisions of _Section 13.16_ or (b) the Buyer Indemnified Party,
prior to making such notification, communication or interaction, obtained a
written opinion of outside counsel opining that the Environmental Liability
was a result of a violation of applicable Environmental Law, or any
Environmental Permit, and Buyer shall not cause or direct any other Person to
assist Buyer in indirectly circumventing the purposes of this _Section
16.4.10_;

16.4.11 In the event Losses suffered by any Indemnified Party are
recoverable under more than one provision of this Agreement and even though
an Indemnified Party is permitted to rely on each provision of this _Article
16_ independently, such Indemnified Party shall only be permitted to recover
with respect to any particular Losses suffered by it one time, under one such
provision, as it is the Parties intent that once any particular Losses have
been recovered by a particular Indemnified Party under one provision, such
Losses no longer exist with respect to such Indemnified Party and, therefore,
recovery by such particular Indemnified Party for such same Losses under
another provision would constitute an unintended and prohibited "double"
recovery;

 

16.4.12 Any claims involving the Refinery Covered Remediation Indemnity must
be brought under _Section 16.2.4_ and will be subject to the additional
limitations contained in _Section 16.4.3.1_, _16.4.3.2_ and _16.4.7_ ;

 



77 16.4.13 Nothing in this _Article 16_ shall be construed as limiting any action
against a Party which is based on Fraud by such Party;

16.4.14 Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the
Buyer acknowledges that:

16.4.14.1 BP Pipelines is not, in this Agreement, making any representation or
warranty or providing any indemnification with respect to the Business or the
Assets other than with respect to the Texas Pipelines System Assets and,
accordingly, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to make
indemnification claims under this Agreement (including under this _Article
16_) to the extent arising out of or relating to a breach of any
representation and warranty, covenant or other agreement under this Agreement
relating to the Business or the Assets against BP Pipelines other than to the
extent such representation or warranty or covenant or agreement relates
directly to the Texas Pipelines System Assets; and

16.4.14.2 BP Products is not, in this Agreement, making any representation or
warranty or providing any indemnification with respect to the Texas Pipelines
System Assets and, accordingly, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to make indemnification claims under this Agreement (including under
this _Article 16_) to the extent arising out of a breach of any
representation and warranty, covenant or other agreement under this Agreement
relating to the Texas Pipelines System Assets against BP Products;

16.4.15 No indemnification claims may be brought by any Buyer Indemnified
Party with respect to the ownership, operation or use of the Injection Wells
by the Seller Companies or their respective Affiliates prior to the Effective
Time, except as set forth in _Section 16.2.8_; and 

16.4.16 No indemnification claims may be brought by any Buyer Indemnified
Party to the extent that the matter which is the subject of the indemnity
claim (a) is for Remedial Work that is within the scope of Buyers obligation
to be responsible for Remedial Work pursuant to _Article 4_ (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, Remedial Work resulting from, caused by or incurred
in connection with the ownership or operation of the Assets and the Business
from and after the Effective Time), (b) results from or arises out of Buyers
failure to maintain or operate environmental control assets and systems in
compliance with applicable Laws, or (c) is exacerbated (including allowing or
causing the migration of Hazardous Substances into soil or groundwater beyond
the existing levels prior to Buyers actions or failure to perform) by
Buyers performance or failure to perform, in violation of applicable Law, any
Remedial Work. Furthermore, if Buyer is conducting Remedial Work for which it
is responsible under _Article 4_ and subsequently discovers the presence of
a substance that would support an indemnification claim for costs to perform
additional Remedial Work necessitated by the presence of such substance (the
"Additional Remedial Work Costs") against the Seller but the Additional
Remedial Work Costs arising out of or relating to such additional Remedial
Work would nonetheless be addressed by Buyers conduct of the underlying
Remedial Work, then no indemnification claim for such Additional Remedial Work
Costs may be brought by the Buyer against the Sellers as a result of its
subsequent discovery of the presence of such substance. If Buyer is conducting
Remedial Work for which Sellers have an indemnification obligation under this
Agreement and subsequently discovers the presence of a substance that would,
at the time of such discovery, support a separate and independent
indemnification claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party against Sellers pursuant to
this _Article 16_ (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes the time
limitations for asserting indemnification claims set forth herein), such
additional indemnification claim for additional Remedial Work shall be deemed
to have been included in the scope of the original indemnification claim
brought by the Buyer Indemnified Party against Sellers.

 



78 Section 16.5 _Disregard of Materiality Qualifiers_. For purposes under this 
_Article 16_ of determining whether any breach or inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty by a Party has occurred, or the amount of Loss
related thereto, in connection with the assertion of an indemnification claim
under this  _Article 16_, such determination shall be made without regard to
any qualifier as to "material," "materiality," or Material Adverse Effect, as
expressly contained in such representations and warranties.

 

Section 16.6 _Exclusive Remedy_.

16.6.1 The Parties acknowledge and agree that, subject to _Section 20.7_, the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities in _Article 4_ and the retention of the
Retained Liabilities in  _Article 5_, the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Agreement, including the indemnification provisions set forth in
_Section 8.6.2_, _Section 8.8.1_, Section 1.8 of _Schedule 9.1_ ,  _Section
13.3_, _Section 13.6_, this _Article 16_ and _Article 17_, and the
termination rights in _Article 19_ contain, and shall be, the exclusive
remedies of the Sellers, the Seller Indemnified Parties and their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Buyer, the Buyer Indemnified Parties and
their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all
contemplated transactions with respect to the Retail Assigned Contracts.
Without limiting the prior sentence and except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each Party hereby waives any claim or cause of action pursuant to
common or statutory Law or otherwise (including any claims under the federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42
U.S.C. §§ 9601 _et seq_., any other Environmental Laws and any claims arising
pursuant to the Retail Assigned Contracts) against each other Party and its
Affiliates with respect to Losses of any nature whatsoever that relate to this
Agreement or are attributable to the Assets, the Business or the Assumed
Liabilities, whether arising before, on or after the Effective Time. Each
Party agrees that the previous sentence shall not limit or otherwise affect
any nonmonetary right or remedy which any Party may have under this Agreement
or otherwise limit or affect any Partys right to seek equitable relief,
including the remedy of specific performance for nonmonetary relief.

16.6.2 All indemnification Liabilities of the Sellers with respect to the
representations and warranties in _Section 15.1.6_ and Tax matters shall be
governed by _Article 17_ and, except as expressly provided in _Section
16.1_, not this  _Article 16_.

16.6.3 _Right to Recoupment or Setoff_. In the event that any Seller fails to
indemnify or reimburse a Buyer Indemnified Party in accordance with the
provisions of this _Article 16_, including within any appropriate time
periods specific in this Agreement, for any Losses incurred by such Buyer
Indemnified Party, then, in each case, Buyer, on behalf of such Buyer
Indemnified Party, may, but is not obligated to, elect to offset against any
Earnout Amount any Finally Determined amounts; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
prior to exercise of the foregoing remedy, Buyer will deliver, or cause to be
delivered, written notice to BP Products at least thirty (30) days prior to
the date on which Buyer intends to exercise such remedy. If Buyer chooses to
offset against any Earnout Amount in accordance with this  _Section 16.6.3_,
Buyer will be entitled to offset against any of its obligations to pay such
Earnout Amount to BP Products in accordance with _Section 6.5_ on a dollar-
for-dollar basis.

 

Section 16.7 _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

16.7.1 If any Third Party shall notify any Party with respect to any action or
claim by a Third Party (a "Third Party Claim") that may give rise to a right
to claim for indemnification against any other Party under _Section 16.2_ or
_Section 16.3_, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party thereof in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure
to give timely notice shall not affect the right to indemnification to the
extent such failure to give timely notice is not prejudicial to the
Indemnifying Party.

 



79 16.7.2 The Indemnifying Party, in accordance with the procedures set forth
in  _Section 16.8_, will have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to
assume and conduct the settlement or defense of the Third Party Claim with
counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless the judgment or
proposed settlement involves only the payment of money damages and does not
impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party. As
provided in _Section 16.8_, the Indemnifying Party may assume the settlement
or defense of a Third Party Claim, at the Indemnifying Partys cost and
expense, without also accepting and agreeing to the claim for indemnification
described in the related Claim Notice. The Indemnified Party shall have the
right at its sole cost and expense to employ separate counsel in any action
regarding a claim hereunder and to participate in the defense thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in any such defense with separate counsel reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnifying Party at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if (i) so
requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable
opinion of both counsel to the Indemnified Party and counsel to the
Indemnifying Party (or, if they disagree, of an independent counsel acceptable
to each of them) a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate
representation necessary; _provided further_ that the Indemnifying Party shall
not be required to pay for more than one such counsel (plus any appropriate
local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any single
Third Party Claim.

16.7.3 Unless and until the Indemnifying Party assumes the settlement or
defense of the Third Party Claim as provided in _Section 16.7.2_, the
Indemnified Party may defend against the Third Party Claim in any manner it
reasonably may deem appropriate for the account of the Indemnifying Party,
and, if the Indemnified Party defends such Third Party Claim and is
determined to be entitled to indemnification from the Indemnifying Party, then
the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for the
reasonable expenses of defending such Third Party Claims.

16.7.4 In no event will the Indemnified Party consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

16.7.5 The Indemnified Party agrees, at the Indemnifying Partys cost and
expense, to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in
contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to
contest, including the making of any related counterclaim or cross-complaint
against any Person (other than a Buyer Indemnified Party, if the Indemnified
Party is a Buyer Indemnified Party, or a Seller Indemnified Party, if
the Indemnified Party is a Seller Indemnified Party).

16.7.6 The Party that is conducting the settlement or defense against
the Third Party Claim shall provide each other Party such information
possessed by the Party that is conducting such settlement or defense as such
other Party shall reasonably request with respect to the Third Party Claim and
the settlement or defense thereof.

Section 16.8 _Procedures_. The Party seeking indemnification under _Sections
16.2_ or  _16.3_ (the "Indemnified Party") may make claims for
indemnification hereunder by giving written notice (a "Claim Notice") to the
Party required to provide indemnification hereunder (the
"Indemnifying Party"). Such notice shall briefly explain the specific claim
for which the indemnification claim is being made, the nature of the claim and
the parties known to be involved, and shall specify the amount thereof to the
extent known by the Indemnified Party. Each Indemnifying Party to which a
Claim Notice is given shall respond to any Indemnified Party that has given a
Claim Notice (a "Claim Response") within thirty (30) days (the
"Response Period") after the date that the Claim Notice is given. Any Claim
Notice or Claim

 



80  Response shall be given in accordance with the notice requirements
hereunder, and any Claim Response shall specify whether or not the
Indemnifying Party giving the Claim Response disputes the claim for
indemnification described in the Claim Notice and whether it will defend any
Third Party Claim specified in such Claim Notice at its own cost and expense.
If any Indemnifying Party fails to give a Claim Response within the Response
Period, such Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have disputed the claim
for indemnification described in the related Claim Notice and to have elected
not to defend any Third Party Claim specified in such Claim Notice. The
aforesaid election or deemed election by the Indemnifying Party not to assume
the settlement or defense of the Indemnified Party with respect to any Third
Party Claim specified in such Claim Notice, however, shall, except as
contemplated by the following proviso, be subject to the right of the
Indemnifying Party to subsequently assume the settlement or defense of the
Indemnified Party with respect to any such Third Party Claim at any time prior
to settlement or final determination thereof; _provided_ that
the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to so assume the settlement
or defense of the Indemnified Party with respect to any Third Party Claim that
the Indemnifying Party has (or is deemed to have) previously elected not to
defend to the extent that the Indemnified Party would be materially
prejudiced as a result of such assumption.

Section 16.9 _Determination of Amount of Losses_. The Losses giving rise to
any indemnification obligation hereunder shall be limited to the actual Loss
incurred by the Indemnified Party that remains after deducting therefrom any
Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party and insurance proceeds
or other payment or recoupment actually received by the Indemnified Party as a
result of the events giving rise to the claim for indemnification, including
any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually received by the
Indemnified Party (less the amount of any deductible paid or reasonable costs
incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection therewith). Upon the request
of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall provide
the Indemnifying Party with information sufficient to allow the Indemnifying
Party to calculate the amount of the indemnity payment in accordance with this
_Section 16.9_. An Indemnified Party shall (a) take all reasonable steps
to mitigate damages in respect of any claim for which it is seeking
indemnification and shall use Reasonable Efforts to avoid any costs or
expenses associated with such claim and, if such costs and expenses cannot be
avoided, to minimize the amount thereof and (b) use its Reasonable Efforts to
recover under insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or other similar
agreements for any Losses prior to seeking indemnification under this
Agreement. If an Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable
insurance policies, or from any other Persons alleged to be responsible for
any Losses, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying
Party, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party and reimburse the Indemnifying Party, as directed by the
Indemnifying Party, for any payment made or expense incurred by the
Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment
up to the amount actually received by the Indemnified Party (less the amount
of any deductible paid or reasonable costs incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection therewith). The Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the
Indemnified Party for all reasonable legal fees and other out-of-pocket
expenses reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party in successfully pursuing
any claim for indemnification against the Indemnifying Party hereunder.

Section 16.10 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity and Reimbursement Payments_. All
indemnification payments or payments of Closing Adjustment Amounts made under
this Agreement shall be treated as purchase price adjustments for Tax
purposes to the extent permitted under applicable Laws.

Section 16.11 _Limitation of Damages_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED TO
THE CONTRARY IN ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT
THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF EACH PARTY, INCLUDING OBLIGATIONS FOR
ASSUMED LIABILITIES AND RETAINED LIABILTIES, AND THE RECOVERY BY ANY PARTY OR
INDEMNITEE OF ANY LOSSES SUFFERED OR INCURRED BY IT AS A RESULT OF ANY BREACH
OR NONFULFILLMENT BY A PARTY OF ANY OF ITS

 



81  REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS, AGREEMENTS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL BE LIMITED TO ACTUAL DAMAGES AND SHALL NOT INCLUDE
OR APPLY TO, NOR SHALL ANY PARTY OR INDEMNITEE BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER, ANY
INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES
(INCLUDING ANY DAMAGES ON ACCOUNT OF LOST PROFITS OR OPPORTUNITIES OR BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE) SUFFERED OR INCURRED BY ANY PARTY OR
INDEMNITEE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH LOSSES ARE IN THE CONTEXT OF AND
DEMANDED IN A THIRD PARTY CLAIM.

TAX MATTERS

Section 17.1 _Filing of Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes_.

(a) With respect to each Tax Return of the Cogen Company, other than any Tax
Return of a Seller Consolidated Group, relating solely to a Pre-Closing Date
Taxable Period that is required to be filed after the Closing Date and every
other Tax Return required to be filed by any of the Seller Companies with
respect to the Assets (each a "Pre-Closing Tax Return"), Seller Companies or
the Cogen Company shall (i) cause such Pre-Closing Tax Return to be prepared
in a manner consistent with prior practices of the entity filing such returns,
except as otherwise required by applicable Laws, (ii) cause to be included in
such Pre-Closing Tax Return all Tax Items required to be included therein, and
(iii) except in the case of any Tax Return to be filed by an entity other than
the Cogen Company, deliver a draft of such Pre-Closing Tax Return, together
with copies of pertinent supporting documentation and workpapers, to the Buyer
for the Buyers review and reasonable comment at least thirty (30) days prior
to the due date for filing any such Pre-Closing Tax Return. BP Products shall
revise such Pre-Closing Tax Return to reflect the Buyers reasonable comments,
if any, _provided_ that the Buyer requests such changes in writing within
fifteen (15) days of the receipt of such Pre-Closing Tax Return, and (unless
such return may be filed by the Seller Companies) shall send the Pre-Closing
Tax Return to the Buyer for filing. The Party required by Law to file each
Pre-Closing Tax Returns will timely file such return with the appropriate
Governmental Authority and, except in the case of any Tax Return of an entity
other than the Cogen Company, will provide a copy thereof to the other Party.
Not later than five (5) days prior to the due date for payment of Taxes with
respect to any such Pre-Closing Tax Return, BP Products shall pay to the Buyer
an amount equal to the amount of Tax shown as due on such Pre-Closing Tax
Return.

 

(b) With respect to each Tax Return of the Cogen Company, other than any Tax
Return of a Seller Consolidated Group, or with respect to the Assets that
relates to a Straddle Period (a "Straddle Period Tax Return"), the Buyer shall
(i) cause such Straddle Period Tax Return to be prepared in a manner
consistent with prior practices of the entity filing such returns, except as
otherwise required by applicable Laws; (ii) cause to be included in such
Straddle Period Tax Return all Tax Items required to be included therein; and
(iii) except in the case of any income tax return to be filed by an entity
other than the Cogen Company, deliver a draft of such Straddle Period Tax
Return, together with copies of pertinent supporting documentation and
workpapers, to BP Products for BP Products review and reasonable comment
at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing any such Straddle
Period Tax Return. The Buyer shall revise such Straddle Period Tax Return to
reflect the BP Products reasonable comments, if any, _provided_ that BP
Products requests such changes in writing within fifteen (15) days of the
receipt of such Straddle Period Tax Return, and will provide a copy of the
Straddle Period Tax Return to the Buyer. The Buyer will cause all Straddle
Period Tax Returns to be timely filed with the appropriate Governmental
Authority and will provide a copy thereof to BP Products. In the case

 



82  of any Straddle Period Tax Return of the Cogen Company, or any other
Straddle Period Tax Return that is not permitted by Law to be filed by the
Seller Companies but must be filed by Buyer and its Affiliates, not later
than five (5) days prior to the due date for payment of Taxes with respect to
any such Straddle Period Tax Return (but not less than ten (10) days from the
BP Products receipt of such Straddle Period Tax Return from the Buyer, as
contemplated above in this _Section 17.1(b)_), BP Products shall pay to the
Buyer an amount equal to its share of Tax for the Straddle Period as
determined pursuant to _Section 17.1(d)_.

 

(c) With respect to any property Tax Return, notwithstanding _Section
17.1(b)_, the Buyer shall be responsible for the timely payment of such
property Taxes; the Buyer shall notify BP Products of the proration of such
property Taxes under _Section 17.1(d)_; and BP Products shall pay to the
Buyer its share of such property Taxes at least twenty (20) days prior to the
due date for such property Taxes (or, if later, within five (5) days following
receipt of the notice of billing).

(d) The portion, if any, of Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period is, in the
case of any Taxes that are either (i) based upon or related to income or
receipts, or (ii) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), equal to
the amount that would be payable as determined by an interim closing of the
books if the relevant Tax period ended on and included the date immediately
preceding the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including
depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between
the portion of the relevant Tax period ending on and including the date
immediately preceding the Closing Date and the remainder of such period in
proportion to the number of days in each period; _provided_ , _further_ , that
any franchise Tax or other Tax providing the right to do business shall be
allocated to the period during which the income, operations, assets or capital
comprising the base of such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the right
to do business for another period is obtained by the payment of such Tax. In
the case of any other Taxes, including property Taxes imposed based on
ownership of the Assets on January 1st of the year that includes the Closing
Date, the portion, if any, of such Taxes that is attributable to the Straddle
Period shall be the amount of such Tax for the entire period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days up to, but not
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire period.

(e) The Buyer shall not amend (or file any claim for refund with respect to)
any Pre-Closing Tax Return without the prior written consent of BP Products,
which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned or delayed, unless
otherwise required by applicable Laws. The Buyer shall not cause or permit the
Cogen Company to engage in any transaction not in the Ordinary Course of
Business on the Closing Date.

Section 17.2 _Transfer Taxes_. Each of the Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Sellers, on the other hand, shall be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of
all state and local transfer, sales, use, stamp, registration or other similar
Taxes ("Transfer Taxes") resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, regardless of the Person liable for such Transfer Taxes under
applicable Law. The Sellers shall be responsible for preparing all Tax Returns
required to be filed by them in respect of Transfer Taxes, and shall cause
all such Tax Returns to be timely and properly filed. Prior to filing the Tax
Returns for Transfer Taxes, the Sellers shall provide such returns to Buyer
for at least twenty (20) days for Buyers review and reasonable comment. The
Sellers shall revise such Tax Returns for Transfer Taxes to reflect the
Buyers reasonable comments, if any. Buyer shall provide such comments to the
Sellers in a timely manner. Any determination or agreement between the Buyer
and the Sellers with

 



83  respect to the valuation of assets for purposes of Transfer Taxes is limited
in scope to Transfer Taxes and shall not constitute an agreement for purposes
of Section 1060 of the Code. 

Section 17.3 _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, in the case
of any audit, examination or other proceeding with respect to Taxes (the "Tax
Proceeding") for which any Seller is or may be liable pursuant to this
Agreement, the Buyer shall inform such Seller within ten (10) days of the
receipt of any notice of such Tax Proceeding, and shall afford such Seller,
at such Sellers expense, the opportunity to control the conduct of such Tax
Proceeding. The Buyer shall execute or cause to be executed powers of attorney
or other documents necessary to enable such Seller to take all actions
desired by such Seller with respect to such Tax Proceeding to the extent such
Tax Proceeding may affect the amount of Taxes for which such Seller is liable
pursuant to this Agreement. Such Seller shall have the right to control any
such Tax Proceeding and to initiate any claim for refund, file any amended
return or take any other action that it deems appropriate with respect to such
Taxes.

Section 17.4 _Access to Information_. After the Closing, the Sellers shall,
and shall cause the Seller Companies to, grant to the Buyer (or its designees)
access at all reasonable times to all of the information, books and records
relating to the Assets within the possession of the Seller Companies, and
shall afford the Buyer (or its designees) the right (at the Buyers expense)
to take extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, each of the foregoing
solely to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the Buyer (or its
designees) to prepare Tax Returns and to conduct negotiations with Taxing
Authorities. After the Closing, the Buyer shall grant to each Seller (or
its designees) access at all reasonable times to all of the information,
books and records relating to the Assets, Excluded Assets or Cogen Company
Excluded Assets within the possession of the Buyer (including Tax work papers
and correspondence with Taxing Authorities), and shall afford each Seller (or
its designees) the right (at such Sellers expense) to take extracts therefrom
and to make copies thereof, each of the foregoing solely to the extent
reasonably necessary to permit such Seller (or its designees) to prepare Tax
Returns and to conduct negotiations with Taxing Authorities.

Section 17.5  _Tax Liabilities and Tax Indemnity_. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement, _Section 16.1_, this _Section 17.5_ and
_Section 17.6_ shall apply to indemnification by the Seller to the Buyer for,
and shall be the sole remedy of the Buyer in respect of, the Losses described
in the following sentence. Each Seller agrees to, severally and not jointly,
indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer from and against any and all Losses that
the Buyer may suffer for (a) any breach by such Seller of the representations
and warranties found in _Section 15.1.6_, (b) any Taxes attributable to the
Assets or the Business for a Pre-Closing Date Taxable Period, and; (c) any
Taxes or similar charges attributable to the Foreign Trade Zone subzone
covering the Assets and Business assessed on any Foreign Trade Zone inventory
during any Pre-Closing Date Taxable Period _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the event Losses suffered by any Indemnified Party are recoverable under more
than one provision of this Agreement and even though an Indemnified Party is
permitted to rely on each provision of this _Article 17_ independently, such
Indemnified Party shall only be permitted to recover with respect to any
particular Losses suffered by it one time as it is the Parties intent that
once any particular Losses have been recovered by a particular Indemnified
Party under one provision, such Losses no longer exist with respect to such
Indemnified Party and, therefore, recovery by such particular Indemnified
Party for such same Losses under another provision would constitute an
unintended and prohibited "double" recovery.

 

Section 17.6 _Tax Indemnity Claims_. The provisions of this _Section 17.6_
shall apply only to the indemnification provided for under _Section 17.5_.
If a claim for Taxes is made against the Buyer and if the Buyer intends to
seek indemnity with respect thereto under _Section 17.5_, the Buyer shall
promptly furnish written notice to each Seller of such claim. Failure of the
Buyer to so notify any Seller within sixty (60) days of the claim being made
against the Buyer shall terminate all rights of the Buyer to indemnity by such
Seller as to such claim to the extent such Sellers position is prejudiced as
a result

 



84  thereof (whether due to an adverse effect on its ability to contest such
claim or otherwise). Such Seller shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of
such notice to undertake, conduct and control (through counsel of its own
choosing and at its own expense) the settlement or defense thereof, and the
Buyer shall cooperate with such Seller in connection therewith. If such Seller
elects to undertake the settlement or defense thereof, then such Seller shall
promptly furnish written notice to the Buyer of such undertaking. Such Seller
shall permit the Buyer to participate in such settlement or defense through
counsel chosen by the Buyer (but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall
be paid by the Buyer); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer shall be
entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel reasonably
acceptable to Seller at the expense of such Seller if (i) so requested by
such Seller to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of both counsel
to such Seller and counsel to the Buyer (or, if they disagree, of an
independent counsel acceptable to each of them) a conflict or potential
conflict exists between such Seller and the Buyer that would make such
separate representation necessary. So long as such Seller, at such Sellers
cost and expense, (a) has undertaken the settlement or defense of such claim,
(b) is reasonably contesting such claim in good faith by appropriate
proceedings, and (c) has taken such action (including the posting of a bond,
deposit, or other security) as may be necessary to prevent any action to
foreclose a lien against or attachment of the property of the Buyer for
payment of such claim, the Buyer shall not pay or settle any such claim.
Notwithstanding compliance by such Seller with the preceding sentence, the
Buyer shall have the right to pay or settle any such claim, but in such event
it shall waive any right to indemnity by such Seller for such claim. If
within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Buyers notice of a claim of
indemnity hereunder, such Seller does not notify the Buyer that it elects (at
such Sellers cost and expense) to undertake the settlement or defense
thereof and assume full responsibility for all indemnified Losses with respect
thereto, or, if such Seller gives such notice and thereafter fails to contest
such claim in good faith or to prevent action to foreclose a lien against or
attachment of the Buyers property as contemplated above, the Buyer shall have
the right to contest, settle or compromise such claim and the Buyer shall not
thereby waive any right to indemnity for such claim under this Agreement.

Section 17.7 _Tax Refunds_. Refunds received or receivable (to the extent
not received due to offset against other Taxes) with respect to Taxes for
which any Seller or any of its Affiliates (including any Taxes due from the
Cogen Companies for a Pre-Closing Taxable Period or the portion of the
Straddle Period ending prior to the Closing Date) have responsibility
hereunder shall be promptly paid as directed by such Seller, and the Buyer
shall cause such Seller to be promptly notified of such refunds upon their
receipt or becoming receivable, as the case may be. 

Section 17.8 _Certification of Non-Foreign Status_. At the Closing, each
Seller shall deliver to the Buyer a Certificate of Non-Foreign Status signed
under penalties of perjury (a) stating that it is not a foreign corporation,
foreign partnership, foreign trust or foreign estate, (b) providing its U.S.
Employer Identification Number, and (c) providing its address, all pursuant
to Section 1445 of the Code.

Section 17.9 _Counterparty Taxpayer Identification Numbers_.

(a) In connection with the performance of services and/or the provision
of accounting systems by any Seller Company or the Cogen Company pursuant to
one or more Transition Services Agreements, Technology Agreements, BP
Trademark Sub-License and Brand Management Agreements, Fuel Station Services
Agreements or Framework Interface Agreements as provided herein or
accompanied hereby, the Sellers and Buyer acknowledge that the Seller
Companies or the Cogen Company may transfer to Buyer information with respect
to the tax identity and/or tax status of counterparties as well as other tax-
related information contained in customer lists, contracts, licenses or other
legal agreements that Seller is transferring to Buyer (such information
collectively referred to herein as "Tax Information"). Without limiting the
generality of the preceding sentence, the phrase "Tax Information" includes
but is not limited to (i) Taxpayer Identification Numbers as set forth on IRS
Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer 

 



85  Identification Number and Certification, (ii) information from one or more
forms in the IRS Form W-8 series, (iii) identification numbers as set forth in
other tax forms or documents, and (iv) certifications with respect to
exemptions from tax withholding.

(b) Buyer acknowledges that any provision by a Seller Company or the Cogen
Company of Tax Information is for the purpose of facilitating compliance with
applicable tax law requirements, including but not limited to the requirement
to perform backup withholding to the extent required by Code §3406\. Buyer
agrees to treat all Tax Information as confidential information pursuant to
Code §3406(f).

(c) In the event the Internal Revenue Service or other tax authority imposes
any tax, fine, penalty, expense or other such cost on a Seller Company or the
Cogen Company on account of the provision of Tax Information to Buyer or on
account of Buyers use of any Tax Information, or in the event that any Seller
Company incurs any other Liability on account of the provision of Tax
Information to Buyer or on account of Buyers use of Tax Information, Buyer
shall indemnify and reimburse the Seller Company with respect to any such cost
or Liability and shall make payment to the Seller Company within ninety (90)
days of the Seller Companys submission of request for such payment.

(d) Each Seller Company and the Cogen Company disclaims any and all
responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of the Tax Information.
Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, Buyer shall not
seek any reimbursement or other payment from a Seller Company or the Cogen
Company in the event the Internal Revenue Service or other tax authority
imposes any tax, fine, penalty, expense or other such cost on Buyer on account
of Buyers use of any Tax Information or in the event that Buyer incurs any
other Liability on account of Buyers use of any Tax Information.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Section 18.1 _Environmental Consent Decrees and Orders_.

18.1.1 The Refinery Consent Decrees and Orders are set forth on _Schedule
18.1.1(a)_ (the "Refinery Consent Decrees and Orders"), and certain
terminated Consent Decrees and Orders are set forth on _Schedule 18.1.1(b)_
(the "Terminated or Completed Consent Decrees and Orders"). The Parties agree
that prior to the Effective Time and thereafter, as necessary, the Parties
shall cooperate and work in good faith to secure all requisite and necessary
modifications to and the transfer of the Liabilities under the Refinery
Consent Decrees and Orders from BP Products to the Buyer and to cooperate and
work in good faith in assisting BP Products and its Affiliates to be fully
released from any further Liabilities thereunder except for Seller Retained
Environmental Liabilities. The Buyer agrees to and shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be responsible for and perform, as necessary, all Liabilities
under the Refinery Consent Decrees and Orders that are not Seller Retained
Environmental Liabilities. The Buyer agrees to cause the provisions of this
_Section 18.1.1_ to be binding upon (i) any successors or assigns of the
Buyer, (ii) any transferee of all or any portion of the Refinery Facilities
and (iii) any grantee of rights of use and/or operation thereof.

18.1.2 Except as provided elsewhere in this Agreement, the Buyer shall not be
entitled to reimbursement or recovery from BP Products or any of its
Affiliates for any Losses, including indirect corporate and administrative
overhead costs, incurred in performing any obligations under the Refinery
Consent Decrees and Orders following the Effective Time.

 



86 18.1.3 The Buyer acknowledges that in connection with BP Products
settlement negotiations relating to potential fines and penalties
attributable to BP Products activities prior to the Closing which are covered
by the Refinery Consent Decrees and Orders, the Governmental Authorities may
seek to impose additional reporting and monitoring requirements and operating
standards on the Refinery Business. In such event, the Buyer agrees to
participate in such settlement efforts. Any such additional reporting and
monitoring requirements or additional operating standards sought by the
Governmental Authorities shall be subject to Buyers approval, which approval
will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

Section 18.2 _Fuels Compliance_. BP Products shall be responsible for all Fuel
Compliance Obligations arising any time prior to the Effective Time and all
Fuel Compliance Obligations for which Buyer is not liable pursuant to this
_Section 18.2_. The Refinery shall not create a benzene deficit within the
meaning of 40 C.F.R. § 80.1230(c) for the gasoline benzene annual averaging
period (or portion thereof) immediately prior to the Effective Time, nor
shall the Refinery carry forward a benzene deficit from that averaging period
(or portion thereof). The Refinery shall not create a sulfur compliance
deficit within the meaning of 40 C.F.R. § 80.205(e) for the gasoline sulfur
annual averaging period (or portion thereof) immediately prior to the

deficit from that averaging period (or portion thereof). From and after the
Effective Time, the Buyer shall be responsible for all Fuel Compliance
Obligations arising (whether as a result of shipping, production, blending or
otherwise) any time at or after the Effective Time, except to the extent such
Fuel Compliance Obligations are the direct result of any Seller Companys
actions or failure to act in compliance with its obligations under this
Section 18.2 or any breach of a representation or warranty by the Seller
Companies. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, BP Products shall not exceed
a maximum average gasoline benzene concentration of 1.30 volume percent at the
Refinery during the period commencing on July 1, 2012 and ending at the
Effective Time, and Buyer shall not exceed a maximum average gasoline benzene
concentration of 1.30 volume percent at the Refinery during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2013. BP Products
and Buyer will reasonably cooperate with each other to make available to
the other such information and data as the other may reasonably require to
comply with all Fuel Compliance Obligations.

 

Section 18.3 _Post-Closing Delivery of Environmental Reporting Data_. Each
Party (the "Cooperating Party") shall use Reasonable Efforts in cooperating
in the other Partys (the "Obligated Party") preparation and certification of
environmental and emissions reports required by the Obligated Party or its
Affiliates or required by any Governmental Authority or applicable Law
relating to the Assets or the Business prior to the Effective Time (the
"Environmental Reports") by (a) providing the Obligated Party with
environmental and emissions information relating to the Assets or the
Business with respect to the period prior to the Effective Time and (b)
causing the relevant employees of the Cooperating Party to reasonably
cooperate with the Obligated Party in the Obligated Partys preparation and
certification of such Environmental Reports. After the Effective Time, upon
reasonable request of any Obligated Party, the Cooperating Party will provide
such Obligated Party with information for the Environmental Reports,
including information for the reports set forth on _Schedule 18.3_ by the
due dates set forth on _Schedule 18.3_. The Cooperating Party shall use
Reasonable Efforts to deliver such information in the format and based upon
prevailing regulatory requirements and practices consistent with those used
by the Sellers in the Business prior to the Effective Time. The Obligated
Party will promptly reimburse the Cooperating Party for all reasonable out of
pocket costs (including direct internal costs with direct internal costs
being reimbursed at cost plus five percent (5%)) incurred by the Cooperating
Party in connection with the Cooperating Partys cooperation contemplated by
this _Section 18.3_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 18.3_, nothing in this _Section 18.3 _and no provision of
information by Cooperating Party or cooperation by the employees of the
Cooperating Party shall be deemed a representation, warranty or certification
by or on behalf of the Cooperating Party as to the accuracy or adequacy of any
information so provided or the appropriateness of the format in which such
information 

 



87  is provided. Each Obligated Party shall be solely responsible for the filing
and certification of all Environmental Reports for the operation of the Assets
and the Business during its respective time of ownership.

TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

Section 19.1 _Termination of Agreement_. The Parties may terminate this
Agreement, as provided below:

19.1.1 The Buyer and the Sellers may terminate this Agreement by mutual
written consent at any time before the Closing;

eighty (180) days after the date of this Agreement or such later date as the
Buyer and the Sellers agree in writing (the "Long-Stop Date"), unless the
failure of the Closing to occur by such date results primarily from such
terminating Party breaching any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Party may
unilaterally extend this date by notice in writing to the other Parties for up
to an additional one hundred and eighty (180) days if a second request is made

$100,000,000 in the aggregate, the Sellers may terminate this Agreement. 

The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
19.1_ shall give notice of such termination to the other Parties in the
manner set forth in _Section 20.5_.

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 20.1 _Press Releases and Confidentiality_.

20.1.1 The Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall
hold in confidence and not disclose or issue any press release or make any
public announcement relating to the terms or subject matter of this Agreement
without the prior written approval of the Sellers, on the one hand, or the
Buyer, on the other hand, respectively, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; _provided_ that any Party may
make any public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by
applicable Law or any listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly
traded securities (in which case, the disclosing Parties will advise and
consult with the other Party regarding the content of such disclosure before
making such disclosure).

20.1.2 Prior to the Closing, each Party shall keep confidential all
information obtained from the other Parties, either before or after the
Closing, which relates to the Buyers proposed purchase of the Assets or the
Business, the Sellers proposed sale of the Assets or the Business, the
contents of this Agreement or the negotiation of this Agreement, and the
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall not reveal
such information to, or produce copies of any written information for, any
Person outside its management group or its professional advisors
(including lenders and prospective financing sources) without the prior
written consent of the Sellers, on the one hand, or the Buyer, on the other
hand, respectively, unless such disclosing Party is required to disclose such
information by judicial or administrative process or by any other
requirements of applicable Law.

20.1.3 If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement should fail to
close for any reason, each Party shall return to the other as soon as
practicable all originals and copies of written or recorded information and
confirm destruction of all information in electronic form provided to
such Party by or on behalf of the other Parties and none of such information
shall be used by such Party, or its Representatives, in the business
operations of any Person or for any other purpose. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Partys obligations under this _Section 20.1_ shall not
apply to any information or document that (a) is or becomes available to the
public other than as a result of a disclosure by such Party or its Affiliates
in violation of this Agreement or other obligation of confidentiality under
which such information may be held or (b) was obtained or is or becomes
available to such Party on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than
the other Party or its Representatives. Except as may be required by
applicable Law, the Parties shall seek appropriate protective orders or
confidential treatment for the schedules to this Agreement in connection with
any filing with or disclosure to any Governmental Authority. The
Parties obligations under this _Section 20.1_ shall survive the Closing or
termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any Party (and any employee, Representative or other agent of any
Party) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind,
the Tax treatment and Tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other Tax
analyses) that are provided to it relating to such Tax treatment and Tax
structure; _provided_ , _however_ , that such disclosure may not be made (x)
until the earlier of (i) the date of public announcement of discussions
relating to the transactions and (ii) the date of the execution of an
agreement to enter into the transactions and (y) to the extent required to be
kept confidential to comply with any applicable federal or state securities
laws.

 

20.1.4 From and after the Effective Time, each Seller shall hold, and shall
cause its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to hold, in
confidence, unless required to disclose such information by judicial or
administrative process or by any other requirements of applicable Law or in
the exercise of its remedies hereunder, all proprietary and
confidential documents and information of or concerning the Business, the
Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, except to the extent that such

 



89  information is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a
direct result of the disclosure of any such information by such Seller, its
Affiliates or its or their respective Representatives in violation of any
applicable confidentiality obligations.

20.1.5 If any Party is required by Law, regulation or legal or regulatory
process to disclose any proprietary or confidential information contemplated
by this _Section 20.1_, such Party being required to make such disclosure
(the "Disclosing Party") shall (a) take all reasonable steps to preserve the
confidentiality of such information, including requesting that such
information not be disclosed to non-parties or the public; (b) give each other
Party prompt written notice of such request or requirement so that such other
Party may seek, at its sole cost and expense, an appropriate protective order
or other remedy; and (c) cooperate with each other Party, at such other
Partys sole cost and expense, to obtain such protective order. In the event
that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, such Disclosing
Party (or such other Persons to whom such request for disclosure is directed)
will furnish only that portion of such information which, on the advice
of such Disclosing Partys counsel, is legally required to be disclosed and,
upon each other Partys request, use its best efforts to obtain assurances
that confidential treatment will be accorded such information.

 

Section 20.2 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the Indemnified
Parties with the respect to the indemnification provisions set forth in
_Article 16_, this Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any
Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

 

Section 20.3 _Succession and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. The Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other
hand, may not assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or
obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the Sellers, on
the one hand, or the Buyer, on the other hand, respectively; except that the
Sellers or Buyer may by notice to the other Parties assign its rights or
delegate its obligations hereunder in whole or in part to any of its
Affiliates,  _provided_ that no such assignment shall relieve the delegating
Party of its obligations hereunder.

Section 20.4  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original but which together will constitute
one and the same instrument.

Section 20.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Texas without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of
the State of Texas or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Texas.

Section 20.7 _Entire Agreement and Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement and
the Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or
between the Parties, written or oral, to the extent they have related in any
way to the subject matter of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict
between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the Technology
Agreement, the BP Trademark Sub License and Brand Management Agreement or the
Transition Services Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall
control; provided, however, that nothing herein shall limit any indemnity
provisions or remedies available under the Technology Agreement, the BP
Trademark Sub License and Brand Management Agreement and the Transition
Services Agreement. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be
valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Buyer and the
Sellers. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless
the same shall be in writing and signed by the Party against whom the waiver
is sought to be enforced.

Section 20.8 _Severability_. If one or more of the provisions of this
Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect under applicable law, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions this Agreement, and
this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction
in such manner as will effect as nearly as lawfully possible the purposes and
intent of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision, and the remaining
provisions hereof shall be given full force and effect.

Section 20.9 _Transaction Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the Buyer and the Sellers will bear their own costs and expenses
(including legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. The fees and expenses incurred by either Buyer or Sellers that are
in the nature of

 



91 filing fees, recording costs, permit fees, and similar items will be shared
one half by Buyer and one half by the Sellers.

Section 20.10 _Amendment of Schedules with Respect to Representations and
Warranties_.

 

20.10.1 Subject to _Section 20.10.2_, each Party agrees that, with respect to
the representations and warranties of such Party contained in this Agreement,
such Party shall have the right until the Closing to supplement or amend the
Schedules with respect to any matter that would have been required to be set
forth or described in the Schedules. In addition, Sellers shall be entitled
to supplement or amend the Schedules without any adjustment pursuant to this
_Section 20.10_ or otherwise to reflect matters which (i) Seller is agreeing
to add to _Schedule 2.2.17_ as a Retained Liability, (ii) are Pre-Effective
Retained Proceedings or (iii) are subject to _Section 5.1.4 (a) or (b)_ for
which Seller is responsible, in each case solely for the purpose of ensuring
that such schedules are not inaccurate as of the Effective Time and for no
other purpose and with no other effect.

20.10.2 If any Party wishes, as permitted pursuant to  _Section 20.10.1_, to
supplement or amend the Schedules after the date of execution of this
Agreement but prior to the Closing, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith
to agree in writing upon an appropriate adjustment to the Base Purchase Price
to reflect the information provided in the supplement or the amendment (any
such adjustment, a "Disclosure Adjustment"). If the Parties agree in writing
on a Disclosure Adjustment, then such Disclosure Adjustment shall be deducted
from the Base Purchase Price and the Buyer shall be deemed to waive any
further right to make a claim with respect to such supplement or amendment to
the Schedule, and such supplement or amendment shall be incorporated into
the applicable Schedule. If the Parties fail to agree upon a Disclosure
Adjustment, and the cumulative additions or changes in the Schedules taken as
a whole would reasonably be expected to result in Losses of Buyer of no more
than five million dollars ($5,000,000) in the aggregate, then (a) such
Schedule shall be deemed amended or supplemented for purposes of determining
whether the conditions in _Section 10.1_ have been met but (b) Buyer shall
accept such changes and be deemed to have waived any claims for
indemnification which could have been available with respect to the changes.
If the Parties fail to agree upon a Disclosure Adjustment and the cumulative
additions or changes in the Schedules taken as a whole would reasonably be
expected to result in Losses of Buyer in excess of five million dollars
($5,000,000) in the aggregate, but less than or equal to one hundred million
dollars ($100,000,000) in the aggregate, then (i) such Schedule shall
be deemed not amended or supplemented for purposes of determining whether the
conditions in _Section 10.1_ have been met; (ii) such supplement or amendment
shall not be incorporated into the applicable Schedule; and (iii) Buyer shall
retain all of the remedies available to Buyer or the Buyer Indemnified Parties
under this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents, including any of the
rights to indemnification hereunder or thereunder as if such Schedule had not
been supplemented or amended. If the Parties fail to agree upon a Disclosure
Adjustment and the cumulative additions or changes in the Schedules taken as a
whole could reasonably be expected to result in Losses of Buyer in excess of
one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) in the aggregate, then Buyer or
Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by delivering written
notice to the other Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Base Purchase
Price shall not be reduced for any Disclosure Adjustment for (1) any
amendments to _Schedule 15.1.3.3_ with respect to Section _15.1.3.3(a)_ , (2)
any amendments to _Schedule 15.1.3.3_ with respect to _Section 15.1.3.3(c)_
if BP Products could not remove the applicable Assigned Branded Jobber
Contract pursuant to the provisions of _Schedule 7.3.2_ or (3) any amendment
of a Schedule for which any provision of this Agreement other than this
_Section 20.10_ separately contemplates and requires an adjustment to the
Base Purchase Price with respect thereto, including _Sections 7.3_ and _8.14;_
and any recovery by Buyer for the same Losses under another provision shall
constitute an unintended and prohibited double recovery. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event there is a Disclosure Adjustment for amendments to
_Schedule 15.1.3.3_ , such Disclosure Adjustment shall not exceed the
adjustment provided for in  _Section 7.3.1_.

 



92 20.10.3 The Buyer acknowledges that there will be no Disclosure Adjustment
with respect to supplements to the Schedules to reflect amendments or
modifications to existing Contracts (including any purchase orders, but
excluding Real Property Leases or Easements) or new Contracts (including any
purchase orders, but excluding Real Property Leases or Easements) being
entered into by the Seller Companies between signing and the Effective Time,
_provided_ such amendments or modifications or additional Contracts were
entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business and were not in violation of
the operating covenants in _Section 8.5_.

Section 20.11 _Dispute Resolution_.

 

20.11.1 Any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents (a "Dispute") shall be resolved in
accordance with this _Section 20.11_. If the Parties are unable to resolve
any Dispute in the normal course of business, any Party may submit a notice of
dispute to the other Party. Within 5 days following delivery of such notice,
senior management of each Party who has the authority to settle the Dispute
and will be responsible for negotiations related to the settlement of the
Dispute will meet or communicate by telephone at a mutually acceptable time
and place to attempt to resolve the Dispute. It is agreed between the Parties
that the content of any communications pursuant to this _Section 20.11.1_
will be and shall remain confidential. The Parties, on behalf of themselves
and their attorneys, hereby agree that they will not in any way reveal the
content or terms of any such communications to any person, firm, corporation,
or entity, with the exception that the disclosure shall not be a violation of
this paragraph where the same is required by Law or court order, or any
agency or authority having jurisdiction to require disclosure; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Parties may disclose the content or terms of such
communications to their, attorneys, accountants, trustees, financial advisors
and/or their tax related consultants, as may be necessary in their business
affairs. If such Dispute has not been resolved within thirty (30) days after
delivery of the notice of dispute, then the Parties may proceed to dispute
resolution pursuant to _Section 20.11.2_.

20.11.2 If the Dispute cannot be settled by direct negotiations within thirty
(30) days following delivery of the notice of dispute, any Party may initiate
mediation by giving notice to the other Party or Parties. The place of
mediation is Houston, Texas. The Parties will attempt to agree on a mediator
and, if the Parties are unable to agree upon such mediator within fifteen (15)
days of initiation of the mediation process, then the Parties will request
that the American Arbitration Association appoint the mediator. The expense
and costs of the mediation will be shared equally by the Parties. It is agreed
between the Parties that the content of any communications pursuant to this
_Section 20.11.2_ will be and shall remain confidential. The Parties, on
behalf of themselves and their attorneys, hereby agree that they will not in
any way reveal the content or terms of any such communications to any person,
firm, corporation, or entity, with the exception that the disclosure shall not
be a violation of this paragraph where the same is required by Law or court
order, or any agency or authority having jurisdiction to require disclosure;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the parties may disclose the content or terms of
such communications to their, attorneys, accountants, trustees, financial
advisors and/or their tax related consultants, as may be necessary in their
business affairs. If such Dispute has not been resolved within thirty (30)
days after delivery of the notice of mediation, then the Parties may proceed
to dispute resolution pursuant to _Section 20.11.3_.

20.11.3 If the Dispute cannot be resolved pursuant to mediation in accordance
with _Section 20.11.2_ within thirty (30) days following delivery of the
notice of mediation, then any Party may bring any suit, action or proceeding
related to such Dispute in any court of competent jurisdiction in federal
court situated in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of Texas, Dallas Division, or if such federal court declines to exercise or
does not have jurisdiction, in the district court of Dallas County, the State
of Texas. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction
of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
cause of action and irrevocably 

 



93  waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such cause of action
in any such court or that any such cause of action brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum and further irrevocably waive the
right to object, with respect to such claim, action, suit or proceeding
brought in any such Court, that such Court does not have jurisdiction over
such Party. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY DISPUTE IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO
A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY;
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 20.11_.

 

Section 20.12 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges that the breach
of this Agreement by the other Parties would cause irreparable damage to such
Party and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate
remedy for any such damages. Therefore, the obligations of each Party under
this Agreement, including the Sellers obligation to sell, and cause to be
sold, the Assets to the Buyer and the Buyers obligation to purchase the
Assets from the Seller or the Seller Companies, shall be enforceable by a
decree of specific performance and appropriate injunctive relief may
be applied for and granted in connection therewith, without the requirement
to post any bond or security in connection therewith. Such remedies shall,
however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other
remedies which any Party may have under this Agreement or otherwise.

_(Signature page follows.)_

 



94 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement as of the date
first above written.
