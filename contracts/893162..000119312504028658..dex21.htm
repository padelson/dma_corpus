iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION



THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") is made as of
February 22, 2004 (the "Execution Date") by and among CREDENCE SYSTEMS
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), CATALINE CORPORATION, a
Delaware corporation ("Merger Sub"), and NPTEST HOLDING CORPORATION,
a Delaware corporation ("Company").



RECITALS 



A. The Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and Company each have
determined that the merger of Company with and into Merger Sub pursuant to the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein (the "Merger") is in the
best interests of their respective companies and stockholders.



B. Merger Sub is a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.



C. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, each outstanding share of
common stock of Company shall be converted into a pro rata share of the Merger
Consideration as set forth in Section 1.6(b).



D. Company and Parent desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and other agreements in this Agreement in connection with the
Merger. 



E. The parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and to cause the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization under the provisions of Sections 368(a) of the Code. 



F. The parties intend that, for financial accounting purposes, the Merger
shall be accounted for as a purchase transaction.



G. As an inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement, NPTest Holding,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("NPTest Holding"), has concurrently
herewith entered into an agreement in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the
"Voting Agreement") to vote certain shares of Companys Common Stock (as
defined in Section 1.6(a) hereof) owned by NPTest Holding to approve the
Merger and this Agreement and to subject such shares to certain
restrictions on disposition of such shares.



H. Parent and certain other parties have also entered into concurrently and
in connection herewith a lock-up agreement in the form of Exhibit B hereto, a
registration rights agreement in the form of Exhibit C hereto and a First
Amendment to Rights Agreement dated as of February 20, 2004, to Rights
Agreement dated as of June 2, 1998 between Parent and Equiserve Trust Company,
N.A. (the "Rights Agreement") in the form of Exhibit H hereto (such
agreements, together with the Voting Agreement, the "Ancillary Agreements").



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and representations set
forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree
as follows:



 ARTICLE I



THE MERGER 



 1.1 _The Merger_.



Subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the "Effective Time" (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof), Company
shall be merged with and into Merger Sub, which shall be the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger, and the separate
existence of Company shall thereupon cease.



 

1  1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_.



The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall take
place as soon as practicable after the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted hereby) waiver of each of the conditions set forth in Article
VI hereof or at such other time as the parties hereto agree (the "Closing
Date"). The Closing shall take place at the offices of Morrison and Foerster,
LLP, 755 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California, or at such other location as

Secretary of State of Delaware being the "Effective Time" and the date of such
filing, the "Effective Date").



 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_.



At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the
Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law"). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.



 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.



(a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided by Delaware Law and such Certificate of Incorporation.



(b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided by Delaware Law and such Bylaws.



 1.5 _Directors and Officers_.



At the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub, serving in such capacity
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified. The officers of Merger Sub, holding office
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified.

"Cash Exchange Ratio" shall mean cash in the amount of Five Dollars and
Seventy-Five Cents ($5.75).



"Company Common Stock" shall mean shares of the common stock of Company,
$0.001 par value.



"Company Options" shall mean any and all options or other rights to purchase
or otherwise acquire shares of Company Common Stock, whether or not presently
exercisable or subject to additional conditions prior to exercise, under and
pursuant to the Company 2003 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Company Stock Option
Plan").



 

2 "Merger Consideration" shall mean the aggregate of (i) the Parent Common
Stock Consideration (including cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 1.6(f)), (ii) the Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock
Consideration (including cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.6(f)), and (iii) the cash payable in exchange for all Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6(b).



"Non-Voting Exchange Ratio" shall mean 0.008.



"Parent Common Stock" shall mean shares of the common stock of Parent, $0.001
par value.



"Parent Common Stock Consideration" shall mean that number of shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.6(b), together with the rights
attached thereto and issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, in exchange for
the shares of Company Common Stock held by all holders thereof, except NPTest
Holding.



"Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock" shall mean the shares of non-voting
convertible stock of Parent, $0.001 par value, to be issued to NPTest Holding
in the Merger, pursuant to the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and
Rights (the "Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock Certificate of Designations")
which shall (a) be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to each of
Parent, Company and NPTest Holding as contemplated by Section 5.19, and (b)
provide, _inter alia_ , as follows:



(i) The holders of Parent Common Stock and Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock
shall be entitled to share ratably in proportion to the number of shares held
by them (assuming full conversion of the Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock
into Parent Common Stock at the then current Non-Voting Conversion Ratio), in
any and all economic rights of holders of the capital stock of Parent,
including, but not limited to, any and all dividends and distributions and,
except as set forth in the proviso immediately below, any and all assets of
Parent that are available for distribution to its stockholders in the event
of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
affairs of Parent (a "Liquidation"); _provided_ that, in the event of any
Liquidation, before any payment or distribution of Parents assets (whether
capital or surplus) shall be made to or set apart for the holders of Parent
Common Stock, holders of Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock shall be entitled
to receive $0.001 per share of Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock; 



(ii) The Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock shall not be entitled to vote on
any matter on which the stockholders of Parent shall be entitled to vote, and
no such Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock shall be included in determining
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock voting or entitled to vote on any
such matter;



(iii) Upon any transfer by NPTest Holding of any share of Parent Non-Voting
Convertible Stock to any Person (and if NPTest Holding shall so elect before
Closing, at the option of the holder thereof), then any such share shall
automatically and thereafter (or, as applicable, upon and after any exercise
of that option), without any action on the part of transferor, transferee or
Parent, be converted into 100 fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent
Common Stock (such ratio, as adjusted pursuant to customary anti-dilution
protections in the Non-Voting Convertible Stock Certificate of Designations,
the "Non-Voting Conversion Ratio"). For the sake of clarity, upon any such
conversion, any such Parent Common Stock shall have full voting rights (
_i.e.,_ entitled to vote on any matter on which the stockholders of Parent
shall be entitled to vote, and shall be included in determining the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock voting or entitled to vote on any such matter).



"Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock Consideration" shall mean that number of
shares of Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock issuable pursuant to Section
1.6(b), together with the rights attached thereto and issued pursuant to the
Rights Agreement, in exchange for the shares of Company Common Stock held by
NPTest Holding.

the volume weighted averages (rounded to the nearest 1/10,000) of the trading

("NASDAQ"), as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets (or such other sources
the parties shall agree in writing) on the Effective Date.



"Stock Exchange Ratio" shall mean 0.800.



(b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. By virtue of the Merger and without
any further action on the part of Parent, Company, Merger Sub or the holders
of any of Companys securities, at the Effective Time, the shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
but excluding all Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 1.6(h)) and any
shares cancelled pursuant to Section 1.6(c), will be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into: (i) in the case of NPTest
Holding, the right to receive (u) that number of shares of Parent Non-Voting
Convertible Stock, together with the rights attached thereto and issued
pursuant to the Rights Agreement, that is equal to the Non-Voting Exchange
Ratio _multiplied by_ the number of shares of Company Common Stock then owned
by NPTest Holding, (v) cash equal to the Cash Exchange Ratio multiplied by
the number of shares of Company Common Stock then owned by NPTest Holding; and
(w) cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6(f); and
(ii) in the case of holders of Company Common Stock, other than
NPTest Holding, the right to receive (x) that number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, together with the rights attached thereto and issued pursuant to
the Rights Agreement, that is equal to the Stock Exchange Ratio multiplied by
the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by those holders ( _i.e._
, other than NPTest Holding); (y) cash equal to the Cash Exchange Ratio
_multiplied by_ the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by holders,
other than NPTest Holding; and (z) cash in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with Section 1.6(f).



(c) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock Owned by Company_. At the Effective
Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by Company as treasury
stock and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any direct
or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Company or Parent shall be cancelled
and extinguished without any conversion thereof.



(d) _Treatment of Company Options_. At the Effective Time, the Company Stock
Option Plan and all Company Options then outstanding under the Company Stock
Option Plan shall be assumed by Parent and converted into Parent Options in
accordance with Section 5.8 hereof.



(e) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratios_. The Stock Exchange Ratio, the Non-Voting
Conversion Ratio, the Non-Voting Exchange Ratio and Cash Exchange Ratio shall
be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Parent Common Stock, Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock or
Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change
with respect to Parent Common Stock, Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock or
Company Common Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time.



(f) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will
be issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
or Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock or Parent Non-Voting Convertible
Stock (after aggregating all shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Non-
Voting Convertible Stock to be received by such holder, including all
fractional shares) shall receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by
(ii) the Parent Stock Price, less any amount required to be withheld under
foreign, federal, state or local tax laws.



(g) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common
stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each
stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall
continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.



 

4 (h) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of
the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for
such shares in accordance with Delaware Law (the "Dissenting Shares") shall
not be converted into a right to receive a pro rata portion of the Merger
Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise
loses the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal, such shares of Company
Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into a right to receive a pro rata portion of the Merger
Consideration. Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received
by Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent,
Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or
settle, any such demands.



 1.7 _Surrender of Certificates_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. Parents transfer agent, Equiserve Trust Company, N.A.,
shall act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger.



(b) _Parent to Provide Parent Common Stock, Parent Non-Voting Convertible
Stock and Cash_. At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall make available
to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I, through
such reasonable procedures as Parent may adopt, (i) the shares of Parent
Common Stock and Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock issuable pursuant to
Section 1.6(b) in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient
to permit payment of cash payable pursuant to Section 1.6(b) and cash payable
in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f), less any amounts
required to be withheld from such cash under foreign, federal, state or local
laws.



(c) _Exchange Procedures_.



(i) As soon as reasonably practical after the Effective Time, the Parent shall
cause to be mailed to each holder of record of (A) certificates representing
shares of Common Stock or Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock (the
"Certificates") or (B) uncertificated shares of Common Stock (the
"Uncertificated Shares"), at the Effective Time, whose shares were converted
into the right to receive the consideration set forth in Section 1.6(b) (and
cash in lieu of fractional shares, less any amount required to be withheld
from such cash under foreign, federal, state or local tax laws), (1) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange
Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify), and (2) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares in exchange for
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent Non-Voting
Convertible Stock and cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant
to Section 1.6(b) (and cash in lieu of fractional shares, less any amount
required to be withheld from such cash under foreign, federal, state or local
tax laws).



(ii) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the Merger Consideration
(pursuant to Section 1.6(b)) shall be entitled to receive, upon (A) surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other
agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, or (B) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange
Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, (X) a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock or Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(b), (Y) cash that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(b), and (Z) if applicable, the
cash payment in lieu of fractional shares that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant  



 

5  to Section 1.6(f), and the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so
surrendered or transferred shall forthwith be cancelled.



(iii) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will
issue or cause to be issued to such Person in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, a new certificate into which the shares of such
Persons Company Common Stock are converted on the Effective Date and deliver
or cause to be delivered to such Person cash in immediately available funds
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(b) and, if
any, Section 1.6(f). When authorizing such issuance in exchange therefor,
Parent and/or the Exchange Agent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate to give Parent and/or the Exchange Agent a
reasonable form of indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent
or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.



(d) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock or Parent Non-Voting
Convertible Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to
the holder of any Certificate not surrendered or Uncertificated Shares not
transferred with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Non-
Voting Convertible Stock represented thereby until the holder of record of
such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall surrender such Certificate or
transfer such Uncertificated Share. Subject to applicable law, following
surrender of any such Certificate or transfer such Uncertificated Share, there
shall be paid to the record holder of the Certificate or transfer
such Uncertificated Share representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock or
Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of any such dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
payable (but for the provisions of this Section 1.7(d)) with respect to such
shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock.



(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common
Stock or Parent Non-Voting Convertible Stock is to be issued in a name other
than that in which the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it will be a condition of the issuance
thereof that (i) the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer or the Uncertificated Share shall be
properly transferred and that (ii) the Person requesting such exchange will
have paid to the Exchange Agent, Parent or any other agent designated by
Parent, as applicable, any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Non-

and its subsidiaries who have a "need to know" the contents thereof in
connection with their duties to Parent and Merger Sub and its subsidiaries.

software included in the Intellectual Property of Parent or its subsidiaries
contains any computer code designed to disrupt, disable, harm, distort or
otherwise impede in any manner the operation of such software, or any other
associated software, firmware, hardware, computer system or network (including

subsidiaries, by any Person, including any employee or former employee of
Parent or any of its subsidiaries. Except as would not reasonably be expected

subsidiaries has entered into any agreement, or otherwise has any obligation,
to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any other Person against any claim of
infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property, other than
indemnification provisions contained in purchase orders or license agreements
that arise in the ordinary course of business and that contain such terms
as are typical for the business, services and products of Parent.



(d) To the Parents Knowledge, neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries is,
or will be, as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement, in material breach of
any material license, sublicense, option or other agreement to which it is a
party relating to its Intellectual Property or the valid Intellectual Property
of any other Person. With respect to any license, sublicense, option or other

enforceable and subsisting. Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has
received any written notice of any actual, alleged, possible or potential
infringement of any Intellectual Property of any other Person party. Neither

any suit, action or proceeding that involves a claim of infringement or
misappropriation of any Intellectual Property of any other Person. Neither
Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has brought any action, suit or proceeding
for infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property of Parent or
any of its subsidiaries, or for breach of any license or agreement involving
any Intellectual Property of Parent or any of its subsidiaries, against any
third party, which is not disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents. No
Intellectual Property of Parent  



 

21  or any of its subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding decree, order,
judgment, office action or settlement agreement or stipulation that (i)
restricts in any manner the use, transfer or licensing thereof by Parent or
any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) may affect the validity, use or
enforceability of such Intellectual Property.



(f) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, Parent and each of its subsidiaries has secured valid written
assignments from all its consultants and employees who contributed to the
invention, creation or development of Intellectual Property of Parent or any
of its subsidiaries, of all right, title and interest in and to
such Intellectual Property, to the extent that Parent or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, does not already own such Intellectual Property by operation of
law. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, in each case in which Parent or its subsidiaries has acquired
any Intellectual Property from any Person other than its consultants and
employees, Parent has obtained a valid and enforceable assignment sufficient
to irrevocably transfer all rights in such Intellectual Property (including
the right to seek past and future damages with respect thereto) to Parent or
its subsidiaries. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, to the maximum extent provided for by, and in
accordance with, applicable laws and regulations, Parent or its subsidiaries
have recorded in a timely manner each such assignment with the relevant
governmental authority, including the United States Patent and Trademark
Office, the U.S. Copyright Office or their respective counterparts in any

faith (after consultation with its financial advisors) that such Takeover
Proposal (or written expression of interest) could reasonably be expected to
lead to a transaction more favorable to Companys stockholders from a
financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
(any such more favorable Takeover Proposal being referred to in this Agreement

Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) Companys Board of Directors
shall continue to recommend the Merger until such time as the Board of
Directors determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
continuing to make such recommendation is inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable law at which time
the Companys Board of Directors may change or withdraw its recommendation or
recommend a Superior Proposal; _provided_ that, before and as a condition to
making any such determination to change or withdraw such recommendation or to
recommend a Superior Proposal, Company must first notify Parent, in writing

(or a description of all material terms and conditions thereof), and then only
if Parent fails to make, within 72 hours of receipt of such written
notification, an offer that the Board of Directors of the Company determines,
in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors, is at least as
favorable to the stockholders of Company as such Superior Proposal may the
Companys Board of Directors change or withdraw its recommendation or
recommend a Superior Proposal, and (2) Company shall in all events allow
Company stockholders to vote on the Merger and transactions contemplated
hereby, unless Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section

than 24 hours from such receipt, of any Takeover Proposal or any notice that

public information relating to Company or any of its subsidiaries or for
access to the properties, books or records of Company or any of its
subsidiaries by any Person that has advised Company that it may be considering
making, or that has made, a Takeover Proposal; shall keep Parent informed of
the status and details of any such Takeover Proposal notice or request in all
material respects; and shall provide Parent with a true and complete copy of
such Takeover Proposal notice or request, if it is in writing or an oral
summary thereof, if it is not in writing.



(d) For purposes of this Agreement, "Takeover Proposal" means, with respect
to any Person, any offer or tender offer or proposal for, or any indication of
interest in (whether written or oral), a merger or other business combination
involving that Person or any of its subsidiaries or the acquisition of any
significant equity interest (15%) in, or a significant portion of the assets
(15% or more on a consolidated basis) of, that Person or any of its
subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



4.5 _ Prohibition on Certain Acquisitions by Parent._



Parent shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries not to, acquire (whether
via merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise), or agree to
so acquire, any material amount of assets of or any equity in any Person or
any business or division thereof, unless that acquisition or agreement would
not (a) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not
obtaining, any authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of
any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the Merger or the
expiration or termination of any waiting period under applicable law, (ii)
increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting
the consummation of the Merger or (iii) increase the risk of not being able

Parent, Company will cause any such elections to be timely made in accordance

the period from the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, each party
shall promptly notify the other party in writing of:



(i) the discovery of any event, condition, fact or circumstance that (A)
occurred or existed on or prior to the date of this Agreement and that caused
or constitutes a breach of any representation or warranty made by such party
in this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby or (B) would
reasonably be expected to constitute a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
that party;



(ii) any breach of any covenant or obligation by such party;



(iii) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that may make the timely
satisfaction of any of the covenants or conditions set forth in this Article V
or Article VI impossible or unlikely;



(iv) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of that Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

affecting Company or any of its subsidiaries or Parent or any of its
subsidiaries, as the case may be, that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
the representations and warranties of that party in this Agreement, as the

5.4 _ Confidentiality_.



The parties acknowledge that Parent and Company have previously executed a
Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement dated January 19, 2004 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), a copy of which is attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ , which
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.



5.5 _ Public Disclosure_.



(a) Company and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing any press
releases or otherwise make any public statements or make any other public (or
non-confidential) disclosures (whether or not in response to an inquiry)
regarding the terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and neither shall issue a press release or make any statements or
disclosures without prior consultation with the other, except as may be
required by law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange or with the NASD.



(b) Before any Merger Communication of Parent, Company or any of their
respective "participants" (as defined in Rule 165 of the Securities Act or
Item 4 of Schedule 14A of the Exchange Act) is (i) disseminated to any
investor, analyst, member of the media, employee, client, customer or other
third party or otherwise made accessible on the website of Parent, Company or
any such participant, as applicable (whether in written, video or oral
form via webcast, hyperlink or otherwise), or (ii) utilized by any officer,
senior manager, key employee or advisor of Parent, Company or any such
participant, as applicable, as a script in discussions or meetings with any
such third parties, Parent or Company, as the case may be, shall (or shall
cause any such participant to) provide the other such party and its counsel
with a reasonable opportunity to review any such Merger Communication for  



 

32  purposes of, among other things, determining whether that communication (x)
is required to be filed under Rules 165 and 425 of the Exchange Act or
(y) constitutes "soliciting material" that is required to be filed by Rule
14a-6(b) or Rule 14a-12(b) of the Exchange Act, as applicable. Parent and
Merger Sub or Company, as applicable, shall (or shall cause any such
participant to) give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by the other such party or parties and their counsel on any such Merger
Communication. For purposes of the foregoing, the term "Merger Communication"
shall mean, with respect to any Person, any document or other written
communication prepared by or on behalf of that Person, or any document or
other material or information posted or made accessible on the website of that
Person (whether in written, video or oral form via webcast, hyperlink or
otherwise), that is related to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, if reviewed by a holder of Company Stock, could reasonably be
deemed to constitute either (x) an offer to sell Parent Stock or
a solicitation of an offer to buy Company Common Stock or (y) a
"solicitation" of "proxies" (in each case, as defined in Rule 14a-1 of the
Exchange Act) in favor of the Merger.



5.6 _ Consents; Cooperation_.



(a) Each of Parent and Company shall promptly apply for or otherwise seek,
and use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, all consents and
approvals required to be obtained by it for the consummation of the Merger
under applicable laws and regulations (including those required under HSR),
including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any
Governmental Authority all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents. Company shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals
under any of Companys material contracts in connection with the Merger for
the assignment thereof or otherwise. The parties hereto will consult and
cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating
to HSR or any other federal or state antitrust or fair trade law.



(b) Each of Parent and Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
HSR, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other Federal, state or foreign
statutes, rules, regulations, orders or decrees that are designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws").

 



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.6(a) or (b),
(i) Parent shall not be required to divest any of its or its subsidiaries
businesses, product lines or assets, or to take or agree to take any other
action or agree to any limitation that would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent or of the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time, and (ii) Company and its subsidiaries shall not be required to
divest any of their respective businesses, product lines or assets, or to take
or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation that would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company.



5.7 _ FIRPTA_.



Company shall, on or prior to the Closing Date, provide Parent with a
properly executed FIRPTA Notification Letter, substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit F, which states that shares of capital stock of
Company do not constitute "United States real property interests" under
Section 897(c) of the Code, for purposes of satisfying Parents obligations
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3). In addition, simultaneously
with delivery of such Notification Letter, Company shall have provided to
Parent, as agent for Company, a form of notice to the Internal Revenue Service
in accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section
1.897-2(h)(2) and substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ ,
along with written authorization for Parent to deliver such notice form to
the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of Company upon the Closing of the
Merger.



 

33 5.8 _ Employee Benefit Plans_.



(a)  _Assumption of Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
Company Option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the Company
Stock Option Plan, whether vested or unvested, will be assumed by Parent and
converted into an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (each a
"Parent Option") as set forth in this Section 5.8. Following the assumption of
the Company Options and the Company Stock Option Plan, all references to
Company in the Company Options and the Company Stock Option Plan shall be
deemed to refer to Parent. _Schedule 5.8(a)_ hereto sets forth a true and
complete list as of the date hereof of all holders of outstanding Company
Options under the Company Stock Option Plan, including the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to each such Company Option, the exercise or
vesting schedule, the exercise price per share and the term of each such
Company Option. On the Closing Date, Company shall deliver to Parent an
updated _Schedule 5.8(a)_ hereto current as of a date shortly before such
date. Each such Company Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement shall
retain its respective vesting schedule under the Company Stock Option Plan and
its respective stock option agreement and each such Company Stock Option
shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the
Company Stock Option Plan, except that (i) each such Company Option will be
exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that would be
issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, assuming that all vesting conditions applicable to such
Company Option were then satisfied, multiplied by the quotient obtained by
dividing (A) the sum of the Cash Exchange Ratio and the product obtained by
multiplying the Stock Exchange Ratio by the Parent Stock Price; by (B)
the Parent Stock Price, (such quotient, the "Option Exchange Ratio") rounded
down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii)
the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of such assumed Company Option will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at
which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.
Consistent with the terms of the Company Stock Option Plan and the documents
governing the outstanding Company Options under such plan, the Merger will not
terminate any of the outstanding Company Options under the Company Stock
Option Plan or, except as set forth on _Schedule 5.8(a)_ accelerate the
exercisability or vesting of such Company Options or the shares of Parent
Common Stock which will be subject to those options upon the assumption of
the Company Options in connection with the Merger. It is the intention of the
parties that the Company Options assumed by Parent qualify, to the maximum
extent permissible, following the Effective Time, as incentive stock
options, as defined in Section 422 of the Code, to the extent, and only to
the extent, the Company Options so assumed qualified as incentive stock
options prior to the Effective Time. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of an outstanding Company
Stock Option an appropriate notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant
thereto and that such Company Stock Option shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this
Section 5.8(a) after giving effect to the Merger). Companys employees who
become employees of Parent or of the Surviving Corporation shall receive
grants of stock options under the Parent Stock Option Plans in amounts
commensurate with the number of options granted to similarly situated
employees of Parent and at such times as Parents employees normally receive
grants.



(b) _Assignment of Repurchase Options_. Company shall take all actions
necessary to assign to Parent, as of the Effective Time, all outstanding
rights of Company which it may hold immediately prior to the Effective Time to
repurchase unvested shares of Company Common Stock (the "Repurchase Options"),
which Repurchase Options shall thereafter be exercisable by Parent upon the
same terms and conditions in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except that the shares purchasable pursuant to the Repurchase Options and the
purchase price per shall be adjusted to reflect the exchange of Company
Options set forth in Section 5.8(a).



(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent and the
Company, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall
each adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretative guidance of the SEC
so that the assumption of the Options, and the acquisition of Parent Stock in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Stock held by any officer or
director of Company who may become a covered  



 

34  person of Parent for purposes of Section 16 of the 1934 Act shall be an
exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the 1934 Act.



(d) If requested by Parent, Company shall, immediately prior to the
Closing Date, terminate Companys 401(k) plan and shall provide to Parent a
copy of the resolutions by the Board of Directors of Company such termination.
Companys employees shall be eligible to participate in Parents 401(k)
plan immediately following the Closing Date. For a period of at least 12
months after the Closing Date, Companys employees who become employees of
Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation shall receive employee benefits
commensurate with those provided by Parent and its subsidiaries to similarly
situated employees. Any of the Companys employees who are involuntarily
terminated prior to July 31, 2004 for reasons other than cause will receive
severance benefits in accordance with the more favorable of (i) the severance
policy set forth in Schedule 5.8(d) or (ii) any applicable severance plan
adopted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Parent and/or Surviving
Corporation shall provide or cause to be provided that under each employee
benefit plan, policy, program or arrangement where service is relevant to a
determination of an employees eligibility to participate, vesting, or level
or amount of benefits, employees of Company who become employees of Parent
and/or the Surviving Corporation shall be credited with their period of
service with Company or any predecessor employer prior to the Closing, to the
extent permitted by applicable law and applicable tax qualification
requirements, and subject to any generally applicable break in service or
similar rules. To the extent consistent with applicable law and applicable tax
qualification requirements, Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation shall make
available, or cause to be made available, to those employees of Company who
become employees of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, medical, dental,
disability and other welfare benefits plans and programs, to the extent the
same is offered by Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation generally to their
respective employees, without regard to any preexisting condition limitation,
actively-at-work requirement or similar limitation, provided, and only to the
extent, that any analogous restriction applied to such employee under an
analogous plan of Company had been satisfied as of the Closing Date. In
determining an employees share of the cost of coverage under any plan or
program of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation for the year in which the
Closing occurs, Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation shall make all
commercially reasonable efforts to credit the employee with any pre-Closing
co-pays and deductibles made by or on behalf of such employee under each
comparable plan maintained by Company prior to the Effective Time for such
year.



5.9 _ DandO Indemnification and Insurance_.



Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation
hereby agrees, to do the following:



(a) The Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless the present
and former officers and directors of Company (each an "Indemnified Person")

the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law or any other applicable laws or
provided under Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on
the date hereof; _provided_ that such indemnification shall be subject to any
limitation imposed from time to time under applicable law.



(b) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
provide officers and directors liability insurance (with carriers at least
substantially comparable to in claims paying rating to Companys existing
carriers) in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the

coverage and amount no less favorable than those of Companys policy in
effect on the date hereof (or, with the consent of the Companys Board before
the Effective Time, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, on terms
no less favorable than those of Parents policy).



(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in  



 

35  each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.



(d) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 5.9 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Company or any of its subsidiaries, or
under Delaware Law or any other applicable laws or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.



(e) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification than are
set forth in Companys Certificate of Incorporation and its Bylaws, as the

6.3(e) hereof, including using reasonable efforts to provide counsel with the
