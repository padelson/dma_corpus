exercise of such assumed Company Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Consistent with the terms of the Company Stock Option Plan and the documents governing the outstanding Company Options under such plan, the Merger will not terminate any of the outstanding
Company Options under the Company Stock Option Plan or, except as set forth on <I>Schedule 5.8(a)</I> accelerate the exercisability or vesting of such Company Options or the shares of Parent Common Stock which will be subject to those options upon

adjustments required by this Section 5.8(a) after giving effect to the Merger). Company&#146;s employees who become employees of Parent or of the Surviving Corporation shall receive grants of stock options under the Parent Stock Option Plans in
