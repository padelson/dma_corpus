_AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_



THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of October 22, 2003, by and between INDIAN RIVER BANKING COMPANY ("IRBC"),
a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Florida,
with its principal office located in Vero Beach, Florida, and ALABAMA
NATIONAL BANCORPORATION ("ANB"), a corporation organized and existing under
the laws of the State of Delaware, with its principal office located in
Birmingham, Alabama.



_Preamble_



The Boards of Directors of IRBC and ANB are of the opinion that the
transactions described herein are in the best interests of the parties and
their respective stockholders. This Agreement provides for the merger (the
"Merger") of IRBC with and into ANB. At the Effective Time of such Merger,
the outstanding shares of the capital stock of IRBC shall be converted into
the right to receive shares of the common stock of ANB (except as provided
herein). As a result, stockholders of IRBC shall become stockholders of ANB,
and ANB shall continue to conduct the business and operations of IRBC. The
Merger is subject to the approvals of the stockholders of IRBC, the Florida
Department of Financial Services and the Federal Reserve Board, and
the satisfaction of certain other conditions described in this Agreement. It
is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that, for federal income tax
purposes, the merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the IRC.



Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 11.1 of this
Agreement.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the mutual warranties,
representations, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties agree
as follows:



 ARTICLE 1

_TRANSACTIONS AND TERMS OF MERGER_



 1.1 _Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, IRBC shall be merged with and into ANB in accordance with the
provisions of Section 252 of the DGCL and Section 607.1107 of the FBCA and
with the effect provided in Sections 259 and 261 of the DGCL and the
applicable provisions of the FBCA. ANB shall be the Surviving Corporation
resulting from the Merger and shall continue to be governed by the Laws of
the State of Delaware. The Merger shall be consummated pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, which has been approved and adopted by the ANB Board and
the IRBC Board.



 1.2 _Time and Place of Closing_. The place of Closing shall be at the
offices of Maynard, Cooper and Gale, P.C., Birmingham, Alabama, or such other
place as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties. The Closing will take
place at 9:00 A.M. Central Standard Time on such date and time as the Parties,
acting through their chief executive officers may mutually agree. Subject to
the terms and conditions hereof, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in
writing by the chief executive officers of each Party, the Closing shall occur
on the last business day of the month in which the closing conditions set
forth in Article 9 below have been satisfied (or waived pursuant to Section
11.4 of this Agreement).



 

1 ##### Table of Contents

  

 1.3 _Effective Time_. The Merger and other transactions provided for in this
Agreement shall become effective: (a) on the date and at the time that the
later of the following shall occur: (i) the Certificate of Merger reflecting
the Merger shall be accepted for filing by the Secretary of State of Delaware,
and (ii) the Articles of Merger reflecting the Merger shall be accepted for
filing by the Secretary of State of Florida, or (b) on such date and at such
time subsequent to the date and time established pursuant to subsection 1.3(a)
above as may be specified by the Parties in the Certificate of Merger and
Articles of Merger (provided that such subsequent date and time shall not
be later than a time on the 30th day after the date that the Certificate of
Merger is filed) (such time is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective
Time"). Unless ANB and IRBC otherwise mutually agree in writing, the Parties
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Effective Time
to occur on the date of Closing.



 ARTICLE 2

_EFFECT OF MERGER_



 2.1 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of ANB in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time.



 2.2 _Bylaws_. The Bylaws of ANB in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation immediately following
the Effective Time, until otherwise amended or repealed.



 2.3 _Directors_. ANB currently has 14 directors (the "Incumbent Directors").
The directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective
Time shall consist of the Incumbent Directors and Mr. Griffin A. Greene. ANB
shall take any and all steps required under ANBs Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and/or Bylaws to increase the size of the ANB Board to 15
members as of the Effective Time and appoint Mr. Griffin A. Greene, effective
as of the Effective Time, to fill such vacancy. Thereafter, ANB agrees that it
shall include Mr. Greene in its recommended slate of nominees for election as
director of ANB at ANBs 2004 annual meeting of stockholders. Not in
limitation of the foregoing, if as a result of the timing of the Effective
Time in relation to ANBs 2004 annual meeting of stockholders and mailing of
proxy materials for such meeting, Mr. Greene is not placed in nomination for
election at such meeting, ANB shall cause Mr. Greene to be appointed to the
Board of Directors of ANB to serve until ANBs 2005 annual meeting of
stockholders. Nothing in this Section 2.3 shall require ANB to elect, appoint,
nominate or recommend Mr. Greene for election to the Board of Directors of
ANB if he shall become the subject of a Disqualification.



 ARTICLE 3

_CONVERSION OF CONSTITUENTS  CAPITAL SHARES_



 3.1 _Manner of Converting Shares_. Subject to the provisions of this Article
3, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of ANB, IRBC or the holders of any shares thereof, the
shares of the constituent corporations shall be converted as follows:



(a) each share of ANB Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding from and after the
Effective Time.



 

2 ##### Table of Contents

  

(b) (1) Subject to the potential adjustment provided for in Section 3.1(b)(2)
and/or Section 3.2 below, each share of IRBC Common Stock (excluding shares
held by any IRBC Company, other than in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of
debts previously contracted, and excluding shares held by stockholders who
perfect their dissenters rights of appraisal as provided in Section 3.4 of
this Agreement) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive
0.9408 shares of ANB Common Stock (as such may be adjusted pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, the "Exchange Ratio"); provided that, subject to the
election rights set forth in Section 3.1(c) below, each holder of IRBC Common
Stock shall have an opportunity to elect to receive cash consideration for
such holders shares of IRBC Common Stock in lieu of receiving ANB Common
Stock.



(2) (i) If the Average Quoted Price is less than $48.00, then the Exchange
Ratio automatically shall be increased to an amount to be determined in
accordance with the following table:



    

Average Quoted Price

* * *

 |  |

Adjusted Exchange Ratio

* * * 

---|---|--- 
  

Less than $48.00, and Equal to or greater than $47.00

 |  | 0.9493 
  

Less than $47.00, and Equal to or greater than $46.00

 |  | 0.9578 
  

Less than $46.00, and Equal to or greater than $45.00

 |  | 0.9663 
  

Less than $45.00

 |  | 0.9748 
 



(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Dollar Equivalent Per Share
Consideration" shall be a dollar amount (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to
the product of (A) the Average Quoted Price multiplied by (B) the Exchange
Ratio (as such may be adjusted). For example, if the Average Quoted Price
were $44.00, the Dollar Equivalent Per Share Consideration would be $42.89.
Notwithstanding the adjustment procedure provided for in Section 3.1(b)(2)(i)
above, if the Average Quoted Price is less than $44.00 (and, therefore, the
Dollar Equivalent Per Share Consideration is less than $42.89), the IRBC Board
may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice thereof to the Chief
Executive Officer of ANB prior to the Closing; provided, however, that,
within 5 business days of receiving any such written notice from the IRBC
Board, ANB may, at its sole option and election, void such termination by
either (X) increasing the Exchange Ratio to an amount equal to the
quotient (rounded to the nearest one ten thousandth) of $42.89 (the "Minimum
Dollar Equivalent Per Share Consideration") divided by the Average Quoted
Price, such that the Dollar Equivalent Per Share  



 

3 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Consideration is at least $42.89, or (Y) with respect to each share of IRBC
Common Stock to be converted into shares of ANB Common Stock pursuant to
Section 3.1(b)(1) above or into cash consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(c)
below, paying the holder thereof additional consideration in an amount of cash
equal to the difference of (I) the Minimum Dollar Equivalent Per Share
Consideration minus (II) the product (rounded to the nearest cent) of (x) the
Average Quoted Price multiplied by 0.9748. The aggregate of such cash
payments, if any, is hereinafter referred to as the "Additional Optional Cash
Consideration." For example, if the Average Quoted Price were $42.00, the
IRBC Board provided a notice of termination, and ANB elected to void such
termination, ANB would be required to either increase the Exchange Ratio to at
least 1.021 ( _i.e._ , the quotient of $42.89 divided by $42.00) or make a
cash payment of $1.95 ( _i.e._ , the difference between $42.89 and $40.94) for
each share of IRBC Common Stock to be converted into shares of ANB Common
Stock.



(c) (1) Holders of IRBC Common Stock shall be provided with an opportunity to
elect to receive cash consideration in lieu of receiving ANB Common Stock in
the Merger, in accordance with the election procedures set forth below.
Holders who elect to receive cash in lieu of exchanging their shares of IRBC
Common Stock for ANB Common Stock as specified below shall receive, for each
share of IRBC Common Stock that is so converted, an amount in cash (the "Per
Share Cash Consideration") equal to the product of the Average Quoted Price
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (as such may be adjusted pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the
aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration that ANB is obligated to pay to satisfy
such elections (the "Maximum Cash Amount") shall not exceed 10% (unless and
to the extent that ANB determines in its sole discretion to increase such
amount to a percentage not in excess of 25%) of the sum of (i) the product of
(A) the number of shares of ANB Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
to holders of outstanding shares of IRBC Common Stock as of the Effective
Time multiplied by (B) the Average Quoted Price, and (ii) the aggregate Per
Share Cash Consideration, and (iii) the Additional Optional Cash Consideration
(if any). 



(2) At ANBs election, either the Exchange Agent or IRBCs transfer agent
shall mail an election form in such form as ANB and IRBC shall mutually agree
(the "Election Form") with or following the issuance of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and at least 20 days prior to the date of the IRBC
Stockholders Meeting or on such other date as ANB and IRBC shall mutually
agree (the "Mailing Date") to each holder of record of IRBC Common Stock for
such IRBC Stockholders Meeting. Each Election Form shall permit a holder (or
the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and
instructions) of IRBC Common Stock to elect to receive cash with respect to
all or a portion of such holders IRBC Common Stock (the shares as to which
the election is made being referred to as "Cash Election Shares").



(3) Any shares of IRBC Common Stock with respect to which the holder shall not
have submitted to the Exchange Agent an effective, properly completed Election
Form prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the day before the IRBC Stockholders
Meeting (or such other time and date as ANB and IRBC may mutually agree) (the
"Election Deadline") shall be converted into ANB Common Stock at the Effective
Time, as set forth in Section 3.1(b) of this Agreement (such shares being
referred to as "No Election Shares").



 

4 ##### Table of Contents

  

(4) Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person submitting such
Election Form at or prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election
Form is revoked and a replacement Election Form not submitted prior to the
Election Deadline, the shares of IRBC Common Stock represented by such
Election Form shall become No Election Shares. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable
discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been
properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election
Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such
matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither ANB nor the Exchange Agent
shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an
Election Form. 



(5) Within 5 business days after the Election Deadline, unless the Effective
Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon thereafter as practicable,
the allocation among the holders of IRBC Common Stock in accordance with the
Election Forms shall be effected by the Exchange Agent as follows: 



(i) _Cash Elections Less Than or Equal to the Maximum Cash Amount_. If the
amount of cash that would be paid upon conversion in the Merger of the Cash
Election Shares (the "Potential Cash Payments") is less than or equal to the
Maximum Cash Amount, then:



(1) each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(1); and



(2) each other share of IRBC Common Stock, including each No Election Share,
shall be converted into the right to receive ANB Common Stock pursuant to
Section 3.1(b).



(ii) _Cash Elections More Than the Maximum Cash Amount_. If the amount of the
Potential Cash Payments is greater than the Maximum Cash Amount, then:



(1) the number of Cash Election Shares designated by each holder of IRBC
Common Stock who properly submitted an Election Form shall be automatically
reduced to that number of shares equal to the product of (A) the number of
such holders Cash Election Shares designated in the Election Form and (B) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the maximum number of Cash Election
Shares allowable such that the amount of the Potential Cash Payments is equal
to the Maximum Cash Amount, and the denominator of which is the total number
of Cash Election Shares designated in the Election Forms; 



(2) each Cash Election Share remaining after adjustment pursuant to sub-
section (1) above shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(1);



 

(3) each share of IRBC Common Stock that would have been a Cash Election Share
but for the adjustment pursuant to sub-section (1) above shall automatically
be deemed to be a No Election Share; and



 

5 ##### Table of Contents

  

(4) each other share of IRBC Common Stock, including each No Election Share,
shall be converted into the right to receive ANB Common Stock pursuant to
Section 3.1(b).



(d) At the Effective Time, all outstanding and unexercised options to purchase
shares of IRBC Common Stock pursuant to the IRBC Stock Option Plans (each, an
"IRBC Option") will cease to represent an option to purchase IRBC Common
Stock and will be converted automatically into options to purchase ANB Common
Stock (each, an "ANB Option"), and ANB will assume each IRBC Option subject to
its terms, including any acceleration in vesting that will occur as a
consequence of the Merger according to the instruments governing the IRBC
Option; provided, however, that after the Effective Time:



 

(i) the number of shares of ANB Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of each
IRBC Option will equal the product of (A) the number of shares of IRBC Common
Stock that were purchasable under the IRBC Option immediately before the
Effective Time and (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole share;
and



(ii) the per share exercise price for each IRBC Option will equal the
quotient of (A) the per share exercise price of the IRBC Option in effect
immediately before the Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio,
rounded to the nearest cent.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, each IRBC Option that is intended to be an
"incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the IRC) will be
adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the IRC. As of
the date hereof, the IRBC Options provide for the purchase of no more than an
aggregate of 198,428 additional shares of IRBC Common Stock. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, ANB shall file a Registration Statement
on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the
shares of ANB Common Stock subject to converted or substitute IRBC Options
and shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses associated therewith) for so long as such converted or
substitute IRBC Options remain outstanding.



(e) Assuming (i) that no holders of IRBC Common Stock elect to receive cash in
lieu of ANB Common Stock pursuant to the cash election procedures in Section
3.1(c) above, (ii) that no holders of IRBC Common Stock exercise their
rights under the Dissenter Provisions, and (iii) that there is no adjustment
to the Exchange Ratio pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(2) above or Section 3.2
below, the holders of IRBC Common Stock (including holders of IRBC Options)
shall have the right to receive, in the aggregate, a maximum of 2,237,543
shares of ANB Common Stock as a result of the Merger. As a result of an
adjustment to the Exchange Ratio pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(2)(i) above,
holders of IRBC Common Stock (including holders of IRBC Options) would be
entitled to receive a minimum of 20,216 and a maximum of 80,864 additional
shares of ANB Common Stock in the aggregate.



 3.2 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event IRBC changes the number of
shares of IRBC Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time
as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise
with respect to such stock and the record date therefor shall be prior to the
Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio, the Minimum Dollar  



 

6 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Equivalent Per Share Consideration, and the amounts and formulas contained
in Section 3.1(b)(2)(ii) shall be proportionately adjusted as needed to
preserve the relative economic benefit to the Parties. In the event ANB
changes the number of shares of ANB Common Stock issued and outstanding prior
to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend or similar
recapitalization with respect to such stock and the record date therefor
shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio, the Average Quoted
Price thresholds contained in Section 3.1(b)(2)(i) and Section 3.1(b)(2)(ii),
the other amounts and formulas contained in Section 3.1(b)(2)(ii), and the
share amounts included in Section 3.1(e) shall be proportionately adjusted as
needed to preserve the relative economic benefit to the Parties.



 3.3 _Shares Held by IRBC_. Each of the shares of IRBC Common Stock held by
any IRBC Company, other than in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted, shall be canceled and retired at the Effective Time
and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.



 3.4 _Dissenting Stockholders_. Any holder of shares of IRBC Common Stock who
perfects his dissenters rights of appraisal in accordance with and as
contemplated by Section 607.1320 of the FBCA (the "Dissenter Provisions")
shall be entitled to receive the value of such shares in cash as determined
pursuant to such provision of Law; provided, however, that no such payment
shall be made to any dissenting stockholder unless and until such dissenting
stockholder has complied with the applicable provisions of the FBCA and
surrendered to the Surviving Corporation the certificate or certificates
representing the shares for which payment is being made; provided, further,
nothing contained in this Section 3.4 shall in any way limit the right of ANB
to terminate this Agreement and abandon the Merger pursuant to subsection
10.1(i) below. If any dissenting stockholder gives notice to IRBC, IRBC will
promptly give ANB notice thereof, and ANB will have the right to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. IRBC
will not, except with the prior written consent of ANB, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for
payment. In the event that after the Effective Time a dissenting stockholder
of IRBC fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws or loses, his right to
appraisal and of payment for his shares, the Surviving Corporation shall
issue and deliver the consideration to which such holder of shares of IRBC
Common Stock is entitled under this Article 3 (without interest) upon
surrender by such holder of the certificate or certificates representing
shares of IRBC Common Stock held by him.



 3.5 _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of ANB Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of certificates
for exchange; no dividend or distribution with respect to ANB Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share; and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of ANB. In lieu of any such
fractional share, ANB shall pay to each former stockholder of IRBC who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of ANB Common Stock
an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (a) the Average
Quoted Price by (b) the fraction of a share of ANB Common Stock to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled.

 ARTICLE 4

_EXCHANGE OF SHARES_



 4.1 _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to the former stockholders
of IRBC appropriate transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore
representing shares of IRBC Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of such certificates to the Exchange Agent). After completion of the
allocation procedure set forth in Section 3.1(c)(5) and upon surrender of a
certificate or certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange
Agent (such shares to be free and clear of all liens, claims and
encumbrances), together with a properly executed letter of transmittal, the
holder of such certificate or certificates shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefore: (a) a certificate representing that number of whole shares
of ANB Common Stock which such holder of IRBC Common Stock became entitled to
receive pursuant to the provisions of Article 3 hereof and (b) a check
representing the aggregate cash consideration, if any, which such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Article 3 hereof, and the
certificate or certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on the Per Share Cash Consideration, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares, any Additional Optional Cash Consideration or
any unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of
certificates for IRBC Common Stock. The Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to deliver the consideration to which any former holder of IRBC
Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder
surrenders his certificate or certificates representing the shares of IRBC
Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Section 4.1. The certificate or
certificates for IRBC Common Stock so surrendered shall be duly endorsed as
the Exchange Agent may require. Any other provision of this Agreement
notwithstanding, neither the Surviving Corporation, ANB nor the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to a holder of IRBC Common Stock for any amounts paid or
property delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property Law.



 4.2 _Rights of Former IRBC Stockholders_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of IRBC shall be closed as to holders of IRBC Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and no transfer of IRBC Common Stock
by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered
for exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.1 of this
Agreement, each certificate theretofore representing shares of IRBC Common
Stock ("IRBC Certificate"), other than shares to be canceled pursuant to
Section 3.3 of this Agreement or as to which dissenters rights of appraisal
have been perfected as provided in Section 3.4 of this Agreement, shall
from and after the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right
to receive the consideration provided in Section 3.1 of this Agreement in
exchange therefor. To the extent permitted by Law, former stockholders of
record of IRBC Common Stock shall be entitled to vote after the Effective
Time at any meeting of ANB stockholders the number of whole shares of ANB
Common Stock into which their respective shares of IRBC Common Stock
(excluding Cash Election Shares) are converted, regardless of whether such
holders have exchanged their IRBC Certificates for certificates representing
ANB Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Whenever
a dividend or other distribution is declared by ANB on the ANB Common
Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, the
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions on all shares
issuable pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
any person



 

8 ##### Table of Contents

  

 holding any IRBC Certificate at or after six (6) months after the Effective
Time (the "Cutoff") shall not be entitled to receive any dividend or other
distribution payable after the Cutoff to holders of ANB Common Stock, which
dividend or other distribution is attributable to such persons ANB Common
Stock represented by said IRBC Certificate held after the Cutoff, until such
person surrenders said IRBC Certificate for exchange as provided in Section
4.1 of this Agreement. However, upon surrender of such IRBC Certificate, both
the ANB Common Stock certificate (together with all such undelivered dividends
or other distributions, without interest) and any undelivered cash payments
(without interest) shall be delivered and paid with respect to each share
represented by such IRBC Certificate. No holder of shares of IRBC Common Stock
shall be entitled to receive any dividends or distributions declared or made
with respect to the ANB Common Stock with a record date before the Effective
Time of the Merger.



 4.3 _Identity of Recipient of ANB Common Stock_. In the event that the
delivery of the consideration provided for in this Agreement is to be made to
a person other than the person in whose name any certificate representing
shares of IRBC Common Stock surrendered is registered, such certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer), with the signature(s) appropriately guaranteed,
and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such
delivery shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
delivery to a person other than the registered holder of such certificate
surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of ANB that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable.



 4.4 _Lost or Stolen Certificates_. If any holder of IRBC Common Stock
convertible into the right to receive shares of ANB Common Stock is unable to
deliver the IRBC Certificate that represents IRBC Common Stock, the Exchange
Agent, in the absence of actual notice that any such shares have been acquired
by a bona fide purchaser, shall deliver to such holder the shares of ANB
Common Stock to which the holder is entitled for such shares
upon presentation of the following: (a) evidence to the reasonable
satisfaction of ANB that any such IRBC Certificate has been lost, wrongfully
taken or destroyed; (b) such security or indemnity as may be reasonably
requested by ANB to indemnify and hold ANB and the Exchange Agent harmless;
and (c) evidence satisfactory to ANB that such person is the owner of the
shares theretofore represented by each IRBC Certificate claimed by the holder
to be lost, wrongfully taken or destroyed and that the holder is the person
who would be entitled to present such IRBC Certificate for exchange pursuant
to this Agreement.

other incentive plan, all other written or unwritten employee programs,
arrangements or agreements, all medical, vision, dental or other health plans,
all life insurance plans, and all other employee benefit plans or fringe
benefit plans, including, without limitation, "employee benefit plans"
as that term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, currently adopted,
maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed to by any IRBC
Company or Affiliate thereof for the benefit of employees, retirees,
dependents, spouses, directors, independent contractors or other
beneficiaries and under which employees, retirees, dependents, spouses,
directors, independent contractors or other beneficiaries are eligible to
participate (collectively, the "IRBC Benefit Plans"). Any of the IRBC Benefit
Plans which is an "employee pension benefit plan," as that term is defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA, is referred to herein as a "IRBC ERISA Plan." Each IRBC
ERISA Plan which is also a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section
414(j) of the IRC) is referred to herein as an "IRBC Pension Plan". No IRBC
Pension Plan is or has been a multi-employer plan within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA.



(b) All IRBC Benefit Plans and the administration thereof are in compliance
with the applicable terms of ERISA, the IRC and any other applicable Laws, the
breach or violation of which is reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on IRBC. Each IRBC ERISA Plan which
is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC has received a
favorable determination letter or opinion letter, as applicable, from the
Internal Revenue Service, and IRBC is not aware of any circumstances that
could result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter/opinion
letter. No IRBC Company has engaged in a transaction with respect to any IRBC
Benefit Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as
of the date hereof, would subject any IRBC Company to a tax or penalty
imposed by either Section 4975 of the IRC or Section 502(i) of ERISA in
amounts which are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on IRBC. There are no actions, suits, arbitrations
or claims, including any investigations or audits by the Internal Revenue
Service or any other governmental authority, pending (other than routine
claims for benefits) or threatened against, any IRBC Benefit Plan or any IRBC
Company with regard to any IRBC Benefit Plan, any trust which is a part of
any IRBC Benefit Plan, any trustee, fiduciary, custodian, administrator or
other person or entity holding or controlling assets of any IRBC Benefit Plan,
and no basis to anticipate any such action, suit, arbitration, claim,
investigation or audit exists.



(c) No IRBC ERISA Plan which is a defined benefit pension plan has any
"unfunded current liability," as that term is defined in Section 302(d)(8)(A)
of ERISA, and the fair market value of the assets of any such plan exceeds
the plans "benefit liabilities," as that term is defined in Section
4001(a)(16) of ERISA, when determined under actuarial factors that would apply
if the plan terminated in accordance with all applicable legal requirements.
Since the date of the most recent actuarial valuation, there has been (i) no
material change in the financial position of any IRBC Pension Plan, (ii) no
change in the actuarial assumptions with respect to any IRBC Pension
Plan, (iii) no increase in benefits under any IRBC Pension Plan as a result
of plan

materially adversely affect the funding status of any such plan. Neither any
IRBC Pension Plan nor any "single-employer plan," within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any IRBC
Company, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one
employer with IRBC under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the IRC or
Section 302 of ERISA (whether or not waived) (an "ERISA Affiliate") has an
"accumulated funding deficiency" within the meaning of Section 412 of the IRC
or Section 302 of ERISA, which is reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on IRBC. No IRBC Company has
provided, or is required to provide, security to a IRBC Pension Plan or to any
single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of
the IRC.



(d) No Liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by any IRBC Company with respect to any ongoing,
frozen or terminated single-employer plan or the single-employer plan of any
ERISA Affiliate. No IRBC Company has incurred any withdrawal Liability with
respect to a multi-employer plan under Subtitle D of Title IV of ERISA
(regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate), which
Liability is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on IRBC. No notice of a "reportable event," within the
meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement
has not been waived, has been required to be filed for any IRBC Pension Plan
or by any ERISA Affiliate within the 12-month period ending on the date
hereof.



(e) No IRBC Company has any obligations for retiree health and life benefits
under any of the IRBC Benefit Plans, and there are no restrictions on the
rights of such IRBC Company to amend or terminate any such plan without
incurring any Liability thereunder, which Liability is reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on IRBC.



(f) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.14(f)_ , neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions provided
for herein will (i) result in any payment (including, without limitation,
severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute or otherwise) becoming
due to any director or any employee of any IRBC Company from any IRBC Company
under any IRBC Benefit Plan, employment contract or otherwise, (ii) increase
any benefits otherwise payable under any IRBC Benefit Plan, or (iii) result in
any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefit.

and whether or not qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC), all
contributions due (including any contributions to any trust account or
payments due under any insurance policy) previously declared or otherwise
required by Law or contract to have been made and any employer contributions
(including any contributions to any trust account or payments due under any
insurance policy) accrued but unpaid as of the date hereof will be paid by
the time required by Law or contract. All contributions made or required to be
made under any IRBC Benefit Plan have been made and such contributions meet
the requirements for deductibility under the IRC, and all contributions which
are required and which have not been made have been properly recorded on the
books of IRBC.

Time and covering persons who are currently covered by such insurance;
provided, that in no event shall ANB be obligated to make aggregate premium
payments for such three (3) year period in respect of such policy (or
coverage replacing such policy) which exceed, for the portion related to
IRBCs directors and officers, 200% of the highest annual premium payments
during the last three (3) years on IRBCs current policy (as in effect as of
the date of this Agreement) multiplied by three (3) (the "Maximum Amount"). If
the amount of premium that is necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, ANB shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of directors and officers
liability insurance obtainable for a premium not exceeding the Maximum Amount.



 8.19 _Assumption of Trust Preferred Obligations_. ANB acknowledges that the
Trust holds Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures ("Debentures") issued
by IRBC pursuant to an Indenture (the "Indenture") between IRBC and Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), dated as of
September 30, 2002 and has issued Floating Rate Trust Preferred Securities
(the "Trust Preferred"). Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, ANB
shall upon the Effective Time expressly assume all of IRBCs obligations under
the Indenture (including, without limitation, being substituted for IRBC) and
execute any and all documents, instruments and agreements, including any
supplemental indentures, required by the Indenture, the Debentures or the
Trust Preferred and thereafter shall perform all of IRBCs obligations with
respect to the Debentures and the Trust Preferred (the "Trust Preferred
Assumption"). IRBC __

 shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Consent of the
Trustee to any supplemental indenture or other document, instrument or
agreement required to evidence such assumption by ANB, and ANB shall
cooperate in good faith with such efforts. In addition, IRBC shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Consents of all necessary
parties as required by the Indenture to a supplemental indenture to the
Indenture that shall expressly state that the Debentures shall be pari passu
to ANBs outstanding trust preferred related debentures in all respects (the
"Pari Passu Supplemental Indenture"), and ANB shall cooperate in good faith
with such efforts. If IRBC is unable to obtain such Consent to the Pari Passu
Supplemental Indenture from such necessary parties after using its
commercially reasonable efforts, then ANB shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Consents to the Trust Preferred
Assumption from all necessary parties as required by the indentures governing
ANBs trust preferred related debentures under such circumstances, and IRBC
shall cooperate in good faith with such efforts. __



 8.20 _IRBC Bank_. As a result of the Merger, IRBC Bank will become a wholly-
owned subsidiary of ANB. It is ANBs intention that, in addition to one or
more officers of ANB, the incumbent board of directors of IRBC Bank will
remain in place after the Effective Time, subject to each board members
continued willingness to serve on this board, annual re-election,
shareholders rights to appoint and remove directors, and the requirements of
applicable Law and IRBC Banks articles of association and bylaws. It is
further ANBs intention that IRBC Bank will be operated as a separate
subsidiary of ANB pursuant to IRBC Banks current charter and that
the continued operations of IRBC Bank will be managed and operated consistent
with ANBs operating philosophy for all banking subsidiaries, subject to ANBs
continued attainment of its desired economic results. If ANBs operating needs
or philosophy require future changes at IRBC Bank, ANB will consider such
issues in a deliberate manner and will make such changes as ANB deems
appropriate at that time.

43 ##### Table of Contents

  

 provided for herein shall be conditioned or restricted in a manner
(including without limitation requirements relating to the raising of
additional capital or the disposition of Assets) which in the reasonable
judgment of the Board of Directors of either Party would so materially
adversely impact the economic or business benefits of the transactions
provided for in this Agreement as to render inadvisable the consummation of
the Merger.



(c)  _Consents and Approvals_. Each Party shall have obtained any and all
Consents required for consummation of the Merger (other than those referred to
in Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement) or for the preventing of any Default
under any Contract or Permit of such Party which, if not obtained or made, is
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on such Party. No Consent so obtained which is necessary to
consummate the transactions provided for herein shall be conditioned or
restricted in a manner which in the reasonable judgment of the Board of
Directors of either Party would so materially adversely impact the economic or

action that prohibits, restricts or makes illegal consummation of the
transactions provided for in this Agreement. No action or proceeding shall
have been instituted by any Person, and the Parties shall not have Knowledge
of any threatened action or proceeding by any Person, which seeks to restrain
the consummation of the transactions provided for in this Agreement which, in

them (the "Tax Opinion"), to the effect that (i) the Merger will constitute a

rise to gain or loss to the stockholders of IRBC with respect to such
exchange (except to the extent of any cash received), and (iii) neither IRBC
nor ANB will recognize gain or loss as a consequence of the Merger (except for
income and deferred gain recognized pursuant to Treasury regulations issued

of such significance with respect to the business or economic benefits
expected to be obtained by ANB pursuant to this Agreement as to render
inadvisable the consummation of the transactions pursuant to this Agreement,
(c) would be materially adverse to the interests of ANB on a consolidated
basis or (d) would render the Merger or the other transactions provided for in

or such IRBC Subsidiary under any loan or credit agreement, note,
mortgage, indenture, lease, license, Contract or other agreement or

aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving Corporation and
IRBC Bank or the IRBC Subsidiary at issue.



(m) _Material Condition_. There shall not be any action taken, or any statute,
rule, regulation or order enacted, entered, enforced or deemed applicable to
the Merger by any Regulatory Authority which, in connection with the grant of

bank and savings association holding companies under similar circumstances.

 10.2 _Effect of Termination_.



(a) In the event of a termination of this Agreement by either the ANB Board or
the IRBC Board as provided in Section 10.1, this Agreement shall become void
and there shall be no Liability or obligation on the part of ANB or IRBC
or their respective officers or directors, except that this Section 10.2 and
Article 11 and Sections 8.2 and 8.7 of this Agreement shall survive any such
termination; provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve any
breaching Party from Liability for an uncured willful or breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement giving rise to
such termination.



(b) In the even that this Agreement is terminated (i) by the ANB Board
pursuant to Section 10.1(j) or (ii) by the IRBC Board pursuant to
Section 10.1(k), then IRBC shall, in the case of clause (i), one business day
after the date of such termination or, in the case of clause (ii), on the date
of such termination, pay to ANB, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the amount of $2,000,000 (the "Termination Fee").

pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(ii), and (ii) concurrently with such termination
or within nine months of such termination IRBC enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or consummates an
Acquisition Proposal, then IRBC shall, upon the earlier of entering into a
definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or consummating
an Acquisition Proposal, pay to ANB, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the Termination Fee. For purposes of this Section 10.2(c) the

be deemed to be references to "a majority."



(d) IRBC acknowledges that the agreements contained in Sections 10.2(b) and
10.2(c) are an integral part of the transactions provided for in this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, ANB would not enter into this

to Section 10.2(b) or Section 10.2(c), as the case may be, and, in order to
obtain such payment, ANB commences a suit which results in a judgment for any
of the Termination Fee, IRBC shall pay ANB its costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit.

Form of Rule 145 Agreement





_ _, 200 _ _



Alabama National BanCorporation

1927 First Avenue North

Birmingham, Alabama 35203



Ladies and Gentlemen:



The undersigned has been advised that as of the date of this letter the
undersigned may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Indian River Banking
Company, a Florida corporation ("IRBC"), as the term "affiliate" is defined
for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and
regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Act"). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated
as of October 22, 2003 (the "Merger Agreement"), executed by IRBC and Alabama
National BanCorporation, a Delaware corporation ("ANB"), IRBC will be merged
with and into ANB (the "Merger").



As a result of the Merger, the undersigned will receive shares of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, of ANB (such shares received by the
undersigned as a result of the Merger are hereinafter referred to as the "ANB
Securities") in exchange for any shares of common stock of IRBC owned by the
undersigned.



ANB agrees, for a period of two years after the effective date of the Merger
or for such shorter period as either ANB is subject to the requirements of
Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), or the restrictions of Rule 145(d) are applicable to the
Shares, to file on a timely basis all reports required to be filed by it
pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act so that the public information
provisions of Rule 145(d) promulgated by the SEC, as the same are presently
in effect, are satisfied such that Rule 145(d) may be available to the
undersigned in the event the undersigned desires to transfer any of the
Shares.



The undersigned represents, warrants and covenants to ANB that:



(a) The undersigned shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of
the ANB Securities in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.



(b) The undersigned has carefully read this agreement and the Merger Agreement
and discussed the requirements of such documents and other applicable
limitations upon the undersigneds ability to sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of ANB Securities, to the extent the undersigned has considered
necessary, with the undersigneds counsel or counsel for IRBC.



 

A-1 ##### Table of Contents

  

(c) The undersigned has been advised that the issuance of ANB Securities to
the undersigned pursuant to the Merger has been registered with the
Commission under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, the
undersigned has also been advised that, since at the time the Merger was
submitted for a vote of the shareholders of IRBC, the undersigned may be
deemed to have been an affiliate of IRBC and the distribution by the
undersigned of the ANB Securities has not been registered under the Act, the
undersigned may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of ANB Securities
issued to the undersigned in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or
other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer
or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other
limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act (as
hereafter amended, "Rule 145"), or (iii) ANB has received an opinion of
counsel reasonably acceptable to ANB (or other evidence reasonably acceptable
to ANB) that such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt
from registration under the Act.



(d) The undersigned understands that ANB is under no obligation to register
the sale, transfer or other disposition of the ANB Securities by the
undersigned or on the undersigneds behalf under the Act or to take any other
action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such
registration available.



(e) The undersigned also understands that stop transfer instructions will be
given to ANBs transfer agent with respect to the ANB Securities and that
there will be placed on the certificates for the ANB Securities issued to
the undersigned, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in
substance:



    "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A
TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
APPLIES. THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT DATED _ _ , 2003,
BETWEEN THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND ALABAMA NATIONAL BANCORPORATION,
A COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF ALABAMA
NATIONAL BANCORPORATION." 
--- 
 



(f) The undersigned also understands that unless the transfer by the
undersigned of the undersigneds ANB Securities has been registered under the
Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, ANB
reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to
the undersigneds transferee:



    "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO RECEIVED
SUCH SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER
NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF
WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED
OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933." 
--- 
 



 

A-2 ##### Table of Contents

  

(g) It is understood and agreed that at the request of the undersigned the
legends set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f) above shall be removed by
delivery of substitute certificates without such legend and the related stop
transfer instructions will be lifted forthwith, at such time as (i) the
undersigned is not an affiliate of ANB and a period of at least one year (as
determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of Rule 144 under the Act) has
elapsed since the date of consummation of the Merger, provided that ANB meets
the requirements of paragraph (c) of Rule 144 under the Act at such time,
(ii) the undersigned is not, and has not been for at least three months, an
affiliate of ANB, and a period of at least two years (as determined in
accordance with paragraph (d) of Rule 144 under the Act) has elapsed since the
date of consummation of the Merger or (iii) ANB shall have received an
opinion of counsel or other evidence, in each case reasonably acceptable to
ANB, that such legend and stop transfer instructions are not required for
purposes of the Act.



Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on the part
of the undersigned that the undersigned is an "affiliate" of IRBC as
described in the first paragraph of this letter, or as a waiver of any rights
the undersigned may have to object to any claim that the undersigned is such
an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.



    

Very truly yours,

Attn: Chairman



Re: _Merger of Indian River Banking Company and Alabama National

Gentlemen:



We have acted as counsel to Indian River Banking Company ("IRBC"), a Florida
corporation, in connection with the transactions contemplated by that certain
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 22, 2003 (the "Agreement"),
by and between IRBC and Alabama National BanCorporation ("ANB"). We render
this opinion pursuant to Section 9.2(d) of the Agreement. Capitalized terms
not otherwise defined in this letter have the definitions set forth in the

_[Mutually agreeable, customary assumptions and qualifications to be

Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications and
assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:

authority to carry on the business in which it is engaged, as described in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and to own the properties owned by it.



2\. IRBC Bank is a national banking association duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the United States, with full
corporate power and authority to carry on the business in which it is engaged,

5\. The execution and delivery of the Agreement by IRBC, and
IRBCs compliance with its terms, do not and will not violate any provision
of the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of IRBC. To our knowledge but
without any independent investigation, the execution and delivery of the
Agreement, and compliance with its terms, do not and will not result in any
breach of or default or acceleration under any mortgage, agreement, lease,

Company is a party or by which any IRBC Company is bound. 



6\. In accordance with the Bylaws of IRBC and pursuant to resolutions duly

4\. _Compensation_. From the Effective Date through the termination of
Executives employment:



(a) _Base Salary_. Executives total annual base salary shall be not less
than $160,000, payable with the same frequency as the salaries of other

its designee, as the case may be.

_] monthly automobile allowance or, at Employers option, to the use of an
automobile owned by Employer.



5\. _Compliance With Rules and Policies_. Executive shall comply with all of
the rules, regulations, and policies of Employer now or hereinafter in

by the board of directors of Bank or ANB or their respective designee. 



6\. _Representation of Executive_. Executive represents to Employer that he
is not subject to any rule, regulation or agreement, including without

could, be expected to limit, restrict or interfere with Executives ability
to engage in the activities provided for in this Agreement.



7\. _Disclosure of Information_. Executive acknowledges that any documents and
information, whether written or not, that came or come into Executives
possession or knowledge during Executives course of employment with Bank or
Employer, including, without limitation the financial and business conditions,
goals and operations of Bank, ANB or any of their respective affiliates or
subsidiaries as the same may exist from time to time (collectively,
"Confidential Information"), are valuable, special and unique assets of
Employers business. Executive will not, during or after the term of this
Agreement: (i) disclose any written Confidential Information to any person,
firm, corporation, association, or other entity not employed by or affiliated
with Employer for any reason or purpose whatsoever, or (ii) use any written
Confidential Information for any reason other than to further the business of
Employer. Executive agrees to return any written Confidential Information,
and all copies thereof, upon the termination of Executives employment
(whether  



 

2 ##### Table of Contents

  

 hereunder or otherwise). In the event of a breach or threatened breach by
Executive of the provisions of this Section 7, in addition to all other
remedies available to Employer, Employer shall be entitled to an injunction
restraining Executive from disclosing any written Confidential Information or
from rendering any services to any person, firm, corporation, association or
other entity to whom any written Confidential Information has been disclosed
or is threatened to be disclosed. In the event of any suit or arbitration with
respect to Executives obligations in this Section 7, Executive will pay all
costs incurred by Employer in securing an injunction (or other equitable
remedy) and/or damages, including a reasonable attorneys fee. Executive
further agrees that he will not divulge to any person, firm, corporation,
association, or other entity not employed by or affiliated with Employer, any
of Employers business methods, sales, services, or techniques, regardless of
whether the same is written or not.



8\. _Competition_.



(a) During the period beginning on the Effective Date and, subject to
extension as provided for in Section 9(c) below, ending on the 3rd anniversary
thereof, Executive shall not, individually or as an employee, agent, officer,
director or shareholder of or otherwise through any corporation or other
business organization, directly or indirectly, other than on behalf of the
Bank: (i) carry on or engage in the business of banking or any similar
business in the Florida counties of Indian River or Brevard (the
"Territory"); (ii) perform services for, as an employee, consultant or
otherwise, any bank, bank holding company, bank or bank holding company in
organization, corporation or other person or entity that has a branch or
office in, or conducts any banking or similar business in the Territory;
(iii) solicit or do banking or similar business with any existing or
prospective customer of Bank or ANB or any of their respective subsidiaries or
affiliates in the Territory; or (iv) solicit any employee of Bank or ANB or
any of their subsidiaries or affiliates to leave his or her employment with
Bank or ANB or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates for any reason, or hire
any such employee of Bank or ANB or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates,
without the prior written consent of ANB. In partial consideration for the
non-competition provisions contained herein, Employer shall make a one-time
payment of $10,000 to Executive within 5 days after the Effective Date.



(b) Executive represents that his experience and capabilities are such that
the provisions of this Section 8 will not prevent him from earning a
livelihood.



(c) If Executive violates the provisions of Section 8(a) above, the period
during which the covenants set forth therein shall apply shall be extended
1 day for each day in which a violation of such covenants occurs. The purpose
of this provision is to prevent Executive from profiting from his own wrong if
he violates such covenants.



(d) In the event of any conduct or threatened conduct by Executive violating
any provision of this Section 8, Employer shall be entitled, in addition to
other available remedies, to injunctive relief and/or specific performance of
such provision. In the event of any suit or arbitration with respect to
Executives obligations in this Section 8, Executive will pay all costs
incurred by Employer in securing an injunction (or other equitable remedy)
and/or damages, including a reasonable attorneys fee.



 

3 ##### Table of Contents

  

(e) Executive acknowledges that (i) Executive has occupied, and will continue
to occupy, a position of trust and confidence with Bank prior to the date
hereof and has and will become familiar with Confidential Information,
including without limitation trade secrets, as that term is defined in Section
688.002(4) of the Florida Code; (ii) ANB has required that Executive make the
covenants set forth in Sections 7 and 8 of this Agreement as a material
condition to ANBs acquisition of the capital stock of Bank, including capital
stock owned by Executive; (iii) the provisions of Sections 7 and 8 of this
Agreement are reasonable in geographic scope and duration and are necessary to
protect and preserve Employers legitimate business interests, including,
without limitation, its trade secrets, valuable confidential
business information, relationships with specific prospective and existing
customers, customer goodwill, and specialized training provided to Executive;
and (iv) Employer would be irreparably damaged if Executive were to breach the
covenants set forth in Sections 7 or 8 of this Agreement.



9\. _Termination of Employment_.



(a) If Employer terminates Executives employment hereunder "For Cause," all
rights and obligations specified in Section 8(a) shall survive any such
termination through the 3rd anniversary of the Effective Date, and Executive
shall not be entitled to any further compensation or benefits from Employer.
"For Cause" shall mean (i) abuse of or addiction to intoxicating drugs
(including alcohol); (ii) any act or omission on the part of Executive which
constitutes fraud, personal dishonesty, embezzlement, misappropriation of
corporate assets, incompetence, breach of a duty owed to Bank, or conduct
that, in the sole discretion of Banks board of directors, negatively reflects
upon the Bank; (iii) indictment or conviction of a felony or a crime of moral
turpitude; (iv) the suspension or removal of Executive by federal or state
banking regulatory authorities; or (v) a material breach by Executive of any
of the terms of this Agreement. In addition, the services of Executive
and the obligations of ANB under this Agreement may be terminated For Cause
by Employer due to the death or total disability of Executive. For purposes of
this Section 9, the term "total disability" shall mean Executives inability,
as a result of illness or injury, to perform the normal duties of his
employment for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days.



(b) Employer may terminate Executives employment at any time for any reason;
provided, however, if Employer terminates Executive other than For Cause, or
if Executive terminates his employment for "Good Reason" (as defined below),
Executive shall continue to receive the amount of his then current base salary
until the 3rd anniversary of the Effective Date (to be paid with the
same frequency as Executives salary was paid prior to termination), and all
rights and obligations specified in Section 8(a) shall survive such
termination until the 3rd anniversary of the Effective Date. Other than the
payment provided for in this Section 9(b), Executive acknowledges that he
shall not be entitled to any other payments, benefits or damages from Employer
in connection with a termination of Executive by Employer other than For Cause
or a termination by Executive for Good Reason, and Executive hereby waives
all rights and claims with respect thereto. "Good Reason" means a material
breach of this Agreement by Employer after Executive has notified Employer of
such breach in writing and Employer has failed to cure such breach within 30
days of receipt of such notice.



(c) If Executive resigns or terminates his employment hereunder for any
reason (other than Good Reason) prior to the 3rd anniversary of the Effective
Date, (i) he must provide at  



 

4 ##### Table of Contents

  

 least 30 days prior written notice of such resignation or termination, (ii)
all rights and obligations specified in Section 8(a) shall survive any
such termination until the 3rd anniversary of the Effective Date, (iii)
Executive shall not be entitled to any further compensation or benefits from
Employer, and (iv) Employer shall be entitled to all remedies available under
this Agreement and applicable law. Upon receipt of any such notice of
termination, Employer may elect, at its sole option, to have Executives
resignation or termination effective immediately. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, at Employers sole option and election, Employer may
continue paying to Executive the minimum cash compensation provided for
in Section 4(a) for any period up to, but not to extend past, the 3rd
anniversary of the Effective Date (each such payment, a "Continuation
Payment"), and all rights and obligations specified in Section 8(a) shall
survive until the later of (A) the 3rd anniversary of the Effective Date or
(B) the 1st anniversary of the date of the final Continuation Payment.
Continuation Payments, if any, would be made with the same frequency as
Executives salary was paid prior to any such termination.



(d) The provisions of Section 7 and Section 8 shall in all cases survive the
termination of this Agreement and the termination of Executives employment,
whether voluntary or involuntary.



10\. _Notice_. For the purposes of this Agreement, notices and demands shall
be deemed given when mailed by United States mail, addressed in the case of
Bank to [ _ _] Attention: Chairman of the Board of
Directors, with a copy to ANB at Alabama National BanCorporation, 1927 First
Avenue North, Birmingham, Alabama 35203, Attention: Chief Executive Officer;
or in the case of Executive, to his last known address of record contained in
the Banks personnel files. 



11\. _Miscellaneous_. No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived
or discharged unless such modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in
writing. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this
Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida without
regard to principles of conflicts of laws. This Agreement supersedes and
cancels any prior employment agreement or understanding entered into between
Executive and Bank, including but not limited to that certain Employment
Agreement dated January 7, 2003.



12\. _Validity_. Should any court of competent jurisdiction, arbitrator or
other judicial body decide, hold, adjudge or decree that any provision, clause
or term of this Agreement is invalid, void or unenforceable, such
determination shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, and all
other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as if
such void or unenforceable provision, clause or term had not been included

this Agreement is/are unreasonable, then it is the express intent of the
parties that such court determine the length of time and/or size of the
territory that is/are reasonable and that such court enforce the terms
of this Agreement in accordance with such determination.

_EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT_



THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into this [ _
_] day of [ _ _], 200[ _ _] (the "Effective Date"), by
and between ALABAMA NATIONAL BANCORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("ANB");
INDIAN RIVER NATIONAL BANK, a national banking association ("Bank";
hereinafter together with ANB referred to as "Employer"); and JEFFREY R.
MORTON ("Executive").



_Recitals_



WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger
Agreement") dated October 22, 2003, between ANB and Banks parent holding
company, Bank has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of ANB; and



WHEREAS, Executive has served as the Senior Vice President/Head of Residential
Lending of Bank, and, as a condition to the consummation of the transactions
provided for in the Merger Agreement, Executive and Employer have agreed to
enter into this Agreement.



_Agreement_



NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual recitals and covenants
contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as
follows:



1\. _Employment_. Employer agrees to employ Executive and Executive agrees to
be employed by Employer, subject to the terms and provisions of this
Agreement.



2\. _Employment Term_. The employment of Executive by Employer as provided in
Section 1 will be for a period of 3 years commencing at the Effective Date,
unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of Section 9
hereof; provided, however, that the obligations and rights set forth in
Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination of Executives
Employment, as more particularly described herein.



3\. _Duties; Extent of Services_. Executive shall perform for Bank all duties
incident to the position of Senior Vice President/Head of Residential Lending
of Bank, under the direction of the President/Chief Executive Officer and
board of directors of Bank or its designee. In addition, Executive shall
engage in such other services for Bank or its affiliated companies as Bank
from time to time shall direct. The precise services of Executive and the
title of Executives position may be extended, curtailed or modified by Bank
from time to time without affecting the enforceability of the terms of this
Agreement. Executive shall use his best efforts in, and devote his entire
time, attention and energy, to Banks business. ##### Table of Contents

  

4\. _Compensation_. From the Effective Date through the termination of
Executives employment:



(a) _Base Salary_. Executives total annual base salary shall be not less
than $105,000, payable with the same frequency as the salaries of other
employees of Employer.



(b) _Annual Bonus Opportunity_. Executive shall be eligible to receive an
annual bonus, the amount of which, if any, shall be determined by the Banks
board of directors or its designee after an annual review of the performance
of the Executive and the Bank for the prior calendar year.



(c) _Benefits_. Executive shall be entitled to vacation days, paid holidays
and sick days, and to participate in Employers health and retirements plans,
as provided in Banks Personnel Policy and as such may be amended from time to
time.



(d) _Equity Incentives_. Executive shall be eligible to receive awards under
any stock option, stock purchase or equity-based incentive compensation plan
or arrangement adopted by Employer from time to time for which senior
executives of ANBs other bank subsidiaries are eligible to participate.
Executives participation in, and awards under, such plans and arrangements,
if any, shall be determined from time to time by ANBs board of directors or
its designee, as the case may be.



(e) _Automobile Allowance_. Executive shall be entitled to a $[ _
_] monthly automobile allowance or, at Employers option, to the use of an
automobile owned by Employer.



5\. _Compliance With Rules and Policies_. Executive shall comply with all of
the rules, regulations, and policies of Employer now or hereinafter in
effect. He shall promptly and faithfully do and perform any and all other
duties and responsibilities which he may, from time to time, be directed to do
by the board of directors of Bank or ANB or their respective designee. 



6\. _Representation of Executive_. Executive represents to Employer that he
is not subject to any rule, regulation or agreement, including without
limitation, any non-compete agreement, that purports to, or which reasonably
could, be expected to limit, restrict or interfere with Executives ability
to engage in the activities provided for in this Agreement.



7\. _Disclosure of Information_. Executive acknowledges that any documents and
information, whether written or not, that came or come into Executives
possession or knowledge during Executives course of employment with Bank or
Employer, including, without limitation the financial and business conditions,
goals and operations of Bank, ANB or any of their respective affiliates or
subsidiaries as the same may exist from time to time (collectively,
"Confidential Information"), are valuable, special and unique assets of
Employers business. Executive will not, during or after the term of this
Agreement: (i) disclose any written Confidential Information to any person,
firm, corporation, association, or other entity not employed by or affiliated
with Employer for any reason or purpose whatsoever, or (ii) use any written
Confidential Information for any reason other than to further the business of
Employer. Executive agrees to return any written Confidential Information,
and all copies thereof, upon the termination of Executives employment
(whether



 

2 ##### Table of Contents

  

 hereunder or otherwise). In the event of a breach or threatened breach by
Executive of the provisions of this Section 7, in addition to all other
remedies available to Employer, Employer shall be entitled to an injunction
restraining Executive from disclosing any written Confidential Information or
from rendering any services to any person, firm, corporation, association or
other entity to whom any written Confidential Information has been disclosed
or is threatened to be disclosed. In the event of any suit or arbitration with
respect to Executives obligations in this Section 7, Executive will pay all
costs incurred by Employer in securing an injunction (or other equitable
remedy) and/or damages, including a reasonable attorneys fee. Executive
further agrees that he will not divulge to any person, firm, corporation,
association, or other entity not employed by or affiliated with Employer, any
of Employers business methods, sales, services, or techniques, regardless of
whether the same is written or not.



8\. _Competition_.



(a) During the period beginning on the Effective Date and, subject to
extension as provided for in Section 9(c) below, ending on the 3rd anniversary
thereof, Executive shall not, individually or as an employee, agent, officer,
director or shareholder of or otherwise through any corporation or other
business organization, directly or indirectly, other than on behalf of the
Bank: (i) carry on or engage in the business of banking or any similar
business in the Florida counties of Indian River or Brevard (the
"Territory"); (ii) perform services for, as an employee, consultant or
otherwise, any bank, bank holding company, bank or bank holding company in
organization, corporation or other person or entity that has a branch or
office in, or conducts any banking or similar business in the Territory;
(iii) solicit or do banking or similar business with any existing or
prospective customer of Bank or ANB or any of their respective subsidiaries or
affiliates in the Territory; or (iv) solicit any employee of Bank or ANB or
any of their subsidiaries or affiliates to leave his or her employment with
Bank or ANB or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates for any reason, or hire
any such employee of Bank or ANB or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates,
without the prior written consent of ANB. In partial consideration for the
non-competition provisions contained herein, Employer shall make a one-time
payment of $10,000 to Executive within 5 days after the Effective Date.



(b) Executive represents that his experience and capabilities are such that
the provisions of this Section 8 will not prevent him from earning a
livelihood.



(c) If Executive violates the provisions of Section 8(a) above, the period
during which the covenants set forth therein shall apply shall be extended
1 day for each day in which a violation of such covenants occurs. The purpose
of this provision is to prevent Executive from profiting from his own wrong if
he violates such covenants.



(d) In the event of any conduct or threatened conduct by Executive violating
any provision of this Section 8, Employer shall be entitled, in addition to
other available remedies, to injunctive relief and/or specific performance of
such provision. In the event of any suit or arbitration with respect to
Executives obligations in this Section 8, Executive will pay all costs
incurred by Employer in securing an injunction (or other equitable remedy)
and/or damages, including a reasonable attorneys fee.



 

3 ##### Table of Contents

  

(e) Executive acknowledges that (i) Executive has occupied, and will continue
to occupy, a position of trust and confidence with Bank prior to the date
hereof and has and will become familiar with Confidential Information,
including without limitation trade secrets, as that term is defined in Section
688.002(4) of the Florida Code; (ii) ANB has required that Executive make the
covenants set forth in Sections 7 and 8 of this Agreement as a material
condition to ANBs acquisition of the capital stock of Bank, including capital
stock owned by Executive; (iii) the provisions of Sections 7 and 8 of this
Agreement are reasonable in geographic scope and duration and are necessary to
protect and preserve Employers legitimate business interests, including,
without limitation, its trade secrets, valuable confidential
business information, relationships with specific prospective and existing
customers, customer goodwill, and specialized training provided to Executive;
and (iv) Employer would be irreparably damaged if Executive were to breach the
covenants set forth in Sections 7 or 8 of this Agreement.



9\. _Termination of Employment_.



(a) If Employer terminates Executives employment hereunder "For Cause," all
rights and obligations specified in Section 8(a) shall survive any such
termination through the 3rd anniversary of the Effective Date, and Executive
shall not be entitled to any further compensation or benefits from Employer.
"For Cause" shall mean (i) abuse of or addiction to intoxicating drugs
(including alcohol); (ii) any act or omission on the part of Executive which
constitutes fraud, personal dishonesty, embezzlement, misappropriation of
corporate assets, incompetence, breach of a duty owed to Bank, or conduct
that, in the sole discretion of Banks board of directors, negatively reflects
upon the Bank; (iii) indictment or conviction of a felony or a crime of moral
turpitude; (iv) the suspension or removal of Executive by federal or state
banking regulatory authorities; or (v) a material breach by Executive of any
of the terms of this Agreement. In addition, the services of Executive
and the obligations of ANB under this Agreement may be terminated For Cause
by Employer due to the death or total disability of Executive. For purposes of
this Section 9, the term "total disability" shall mean Executives inability,
as a result of illness or injury, to perform the normal duties of his
employment for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days.



(b) Employer may terminate Executives employment at any time for any reason;
provided, however, if Employer terminates Executive other than For Cause, or
if Executive terminates his employment for "Good Reason" (as defined below),
Executive shall continue to receive the amount of his then current base salary
until the 3rd anniversary of the Effective Date (to be paid with the
same frequency as Executives salary was paid prior to termination), and all
rights and obligations specified in Section 8(a) shall survive such
termination until the 3rd anniversary of the Effective Date. Other than the
payment provided for in this Section 9(b), Executive acknowledges that he
shall not be entitled to any other payments, benefits or damages from Employer
in connection with a termination of Executive by Employer other than For Cause
or a termination by Executive for Good Reason, and Executive hereby waives
all rights and claims with respect thereto. "Good Reason" means a material
breach of this Agreement by Employer after Executive has notified Employer of
such breach in writing and Employer has failed to cure such breach within 30
days of receipt of such notice.



(c) If Executive resigns or terminates his employment hereunder for any
reason (other than Good Reason) prior to the 3rd anniversary of the Effective
Date, (i) he must provide at



 

4 ##### Table of Contents

  

 least 30 days prior written notice of such resignation or termination, (ii)
all rights and obligations specified in Section 8(a) shall survive any
such termination until the 3rd anniversary of the Effective Date, (iii)
Executive shall not be entitled to any further compensation or benefits from
Employer, and (iv) Employer shall be entitled to all remedies available under
this Agreement and applicable law. Upon receipt of any such notice of
termination, Employer may elect, at its sole option, to have Executives
resignation or termination effective immediately. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, at Employers sole option and election, Employer may
continue paying to Executive the minimum cash compensation provided for
in Section 4(a) for any period up to, but not to extend past, the 3rd
anniversary of the Effective Date (each such payment, a "Continuation
Payment"), and all rights and obligations specified in Section 8(a) shall
survive until the later of (A) the 3rd anniversary of the Effective Date or
(B) the 1st anniversary of the date of the final Continuation Payment.
Continuation Payments, if any, would be made with the same frequency as
Executives salary was paid prior to any such termination.



(d) The provisions of Section 7 and Section 8 shall in all cases survive the
termination of this Agreement and the termination of Executives employment,
whether voluntary or involuntary.



10\. _Notice_. For the purposes of this Agreement, notices and demands shall
be deemed given when mailed by United States mail, addressed in the case of
Bank to [ _ _] Attention: Chairman of the Board of
Directors, with a copy to ANB at Alabama National BanCorporation, 1927 First
Avenue North, Birmingham, Alabama 35203, Attention: Chief Executive Officer;
or in the case of Executive, to his last known address of record contained in
the Banks personnel files.



11\. _Miscellaneous_. No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived
or discharged unless such modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in
writing. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this
Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida without
regard to principles of conflicts of laws. This Agreement supersedes and
cancels any prior employment agreement or understanding entered into between
Executive and Bank, including but not limited to that certain Employment
Agreement dated January 6, 2003. 



12\. _Validity_. Should any court of competent jurisdiction, arbitrator or
other judicial body decide, hold, adjudge or decree that any provision, clause
or term of this Agreement is invalid, void or unenforceable, such
determination shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, and all
other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as if
such void or unenforceable provision, clause or term had not been included
herein. Such determination shall not be deemed to affect the validity or
enforceability of this entire Agreement in any other situation or
circumstance, and the parties agree that the scope of this Agreement is
intended to extend to Employer the maximum protection permitted by law. The
parties expressly deem the length of time and the size of the territory
provided for in Section 8 of this Agreement to be reasonable. If, however, any
judicial body or arbitrator decides, holds, adjudges or decrees that the
length of time and/or the size of the territory provided for in Section 8 of
this Agreement is/are unreasonable, then it is the express intent of the
parties that such court determine the length of time and/or size of the
territory that is/are reasonable and that such court enforce the terms of this
Agreement in accordance with such determination.



 

5 ##### Table of Contents

  

13\. _Arbitration_.



(a) Except as may otherwise hereinafter be provided, any dispute or
controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be
settled exclusively by arbitration in Orlando, Florida, in accordance with the
rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The agreement
set forth herein to arbitrate shall be specifically enforceable under
the prevailing arbitration law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employer shall
have the right to seek enforcement by preliminary injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief of the provisions of Section 7 and/or 8
hereof in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction without regard
to whether any such claim has been or can be referred to arbitration.



(b) The parties hereto (i) acknowledge that they have read and understood the
provisions of this Section regarding arbitration and (ii) that performance of
this Agreement will be interstate commerce as that term is used in the Federal
Arbitration Act, and the parties contemplate substantial interstate activity
in the performance of this Agreement including, but not limited to, interstate
travel, the use of interstate phone lines, the use of the U.S. mail services
and other interstate courier services.



(c) Notice of the demand for arbitration shall be filed in writing with the
other party to this Agreement and with the American Arbitration
Association. The demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable
time after the claim, dispute or other matter in question has arisen, and in
no event shall it be made after the date when institution of legal or
equitable proceedings based on such claim, dispute or other matter in
question would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The award
rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and judgment may be entered upon it
in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.



14\. _Parties_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of any successors or assigns to Bank or ANB. Executive may not assign
any of his rights or delegate any of his duties or obligations under this
Agreement or any portion hereof. 



15\. _Waiver of Claims_. In consideration of the obligations of Employer
hereunder, Executive, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
unconditionally releases Employer, its directors, officers, employees and
shareholders, from any and all claims, liabilities and obligations of any
nature pertaining to termination of Executives employment by Employer,
including but not limited to (a) any claims under federal, state or local laws
prohibiting discrimination, including without limitation the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, or (b) any claims
growing out of any alleged legal restrictions on Employers right to terminate
Executives employment, such as any alleged implied contract of employment or
termination contrary to public policy. Executive acknowledges that he has
been advised to consult with an attorney prior to signing this Agreement, that
he has had no less than 21 days to consider this Agreement prior to execution
hereof, and that he may revoke this Agreement at any time within 7 days
following the execution hereof by written notice to Employer.



16\. _Tax Withholding_. All compensation payable pursuant to this Agreement,
including without limitation severance compensation, shall be subject to
reduction by all applicable withholding, social security and other federal,

Employment, as more particularly described herein.

4\. _Compensation_. From the Effective Date through the termination of

than $100,000, payable with the same frequency as the salaries of other
employees of Employer.



(b) _Annual Bonus Opportunity_. Executive shall be eligible to receive an

of the Executive and the Bank for the prior calendar year.

and sick days, and to participate in Employers health and retirements plans,
as provided in Banks Personnel Policy and as such may be amended from time to

(d) _Equity Incentives_. Executive shall be eligible to receive awards under
any stock option, stock purchase or equity-based incentive compensation plan
or arrangement adopted by Employer from time to time for which senior
executives of ANBs other bank subsidiaries are eligible to participate.
Executives participation in, and awards under, such plans and arrangements,
if any, shall be determined from time to time by ANBs board of directors or
its designee, as the case may be.



(e) _Automobile Allowance_. Executive shall be entitled to a $[ _
_] monthly automobile allowance or, at Employers option, to the use of an
automobile owned by Employer.



5\. _Compliance With Rules and Policies_. Executive shall comply with all of
the rules, regulations, and policies of Employer now or hereinafter in
effect. He shall promptly and faithfully do and perform any and all other
duties and responsibilities which he may, from time to time, be directed to do
by the board of directors of Bank or ANB or their respective designee. 



6\. _Representation of Executive_. Executive represents to Employer that he
is not subject to any rule, regulation or agreement, including without
limitation, any non-compete agreement, that purports to, or which reasonably
could, be expected to limit, restrict or interfere with Executives ability
to engage in the activities provided for in this Agreement.



7\. _Disclosure of Information_. Executive acknowledges that any documents and
information, whether written or not, that came or come into Executives
possession or knowledge during Executives course of employment with Bank or
Employer, including, without limitation the financial and business conditions,
goals and operations of Bank, ANB or any of their respective affiliates or
subsidiaries as the same may exist from time to time (collectively,
"Confidential Information"), are valuable, special and unique assets of
Employers business. Executive will not, during or after the term of this
Agreement: (i) disclose any written Confidential Information to any person,
firm, corporation, association, or other entity not employed by or affiliated
with Employer for any reason or purpose whatsoever, or (ii) use any written
Confidential Information for any reason other than to further the business of
Employer. Executive agrees to return any written Confidential Information,
and all copies thereof, upon the termination of Executives employment
(whether  



 

2 ##### Table of Contents

  

 hereunder or otherwise). In the event of a breach or threatened breach by
Executive of the provisions of this Section 7, in addition to all other
remedies available to Employer, Employer shall be entitled to an injunction
restraining Executive from disclosing any written Confidential Information or
from rendering any services to any person, firm, corporation, association or
other entity to whom any written Confidential Information has been disclosed
or is threatened to be disclosed. In the event of any suit or arbitration with
respect to Executives obligations in this Section 7, Executive will pay all
costs incurred by Employer in securing an injunction (or other equitable
remedy) and/or damages, including a reasonable attorneys fee. Executive
further agrees that he will not divulge to any person, firm, corporation,
association, or other entity not employed by or affiliated with Employer, any
of Employers business methods, sales, services, or techniques, regardless of
whether the same is written or not.



8\. _Competition_.



(a) During the period beginning on the Effective Date and, subject to
extension as provided for in Section 9(c) below, ending on the 3rd anniversary
thereof, Executive shall not, individually or as an employee, agent, officer,
director or shareholder of or otherwise through any corporation or other
business organization, directly or indirectly, other than on behalf of the
Bank: (i) carry on or engage in the business of banking or any similar
business in the Florida counties of Indian River or Brevard (the
"Territory"); (ii) perform services for, as an employee, consultant or
otherwise, any bank, bank holding company, bank or bank holding company in
organization, corporation or other person or entity that has a branch or
office in, or conducts any banking or similar business in the Territory;
(iii) solicit or do banking or similar business with any existing or
prospective customer of Bank or ANB or any of their respective subsidiaries or
affiliates in the Territory; or (iv) solicit any employee of Bank or ANB or
any of their subsidiaries or affiliates to leave his or her employment with
Bank or ANB or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates for any reason, or hire
any such employee of Bank or ANB or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates,
without the prior written consent of ANB. In partial consideration for the
non-competition provisions contained herein, Employer shall make a one-time
payment of $10,000 to Executive within 5 days after the Effective Date.



(b) Executive represents that his experience and capabilities are such that
the provisions of this Section 8 will not prevent him from earning a
livelihood.



(c) If Executive violates the provisions of Section 8(a) above, the period
during which the covenants set forth therein shall apply shall be extended
1 day for each day in which a violation of such covenants occurs. The purpose
of this provision is to prevent Executive from profiting from his own wrong if
he violates such covenants.



(d) In the event of any conduct or threatened conduct by Executive violating
any provision of this Section 8, Employer shall be entitled, in addition to
other available remedies, to injunctive relief and/or specific performance of
such provision. In the event of any suit or arbitration with respect to
Executives obligations in this Section 8, Executive will pay all costs
incurred by Employer in securing an injunction (or other equitable remedy)
and/or damages, including a reasonable attorneys fee.



 

3 ##### Table of Contents

  

(e) Executive acknowledges that (i) Executive has occupied, and will continue
to occupy, a position of trust and confidence with Bank prior to the date
hereof and has and will become familiar with Confidential Information,
including without limitation trade secrets, as that term is defined in Section
688.002(4) of the Florida Code; (ii) ANB has required that Executive make the
covenants set forth in Sections 7 and 8 of this Agreement as a material
condition to ANBs acquisition of the capital stock of Bank, including capital
stock owned by Executive; (iii) the provisions of Sections 7 and 8 of this
Agreement are reasonable in geographic scope and duration and are necessary to
protect and preserve Employers legitimate business interests, including,
without limitation, its trade secrets, valuable confidential
business information, relationships with specific prospective and existing
customers, customer goodwill, and specialized training provided to Executive;
and (iv) Employer would be irreparably damaged if Executive were to breach the
covenants set forth in Sections 7 or 8 of this Agreement.



9\. _Termination of Employment_.



(a) If Employer terminates Executives employment hereunder "For Cause," all
rights and obligations specified in Section 8(a) shall survive any such
termination through the 3rd anniversary of the Effective Date, and Executive
shall not be entitled to any further compensation or benefits from Employer.
"For Cause" shall mean (i) abuse of or addiction to intoxicating drugs
(including alcohol); (ii) any act or omission on the part of Executive which
constitutes fraud, personal dishonesty, embezzlement, misappropriation of
corporate assets, incompetence, breach of a duty owed to Bank, or conduct
that, in the sole discretion of Banks board of directors, negatively reflects
upon the Bank; (iii) indictment or conviction of a felony or a crime of moral
turpitude; (iv) the suspension or removal of Executive by federal or state
banking regulatory authorities; or (v) a material breach by Executive of any
of the terms of this Agreement. In addition, the services of Executive
and the obligations of ANB under this Agreement may be terminated For Cause
by Employer due to the death or total disability of Executive. For purposes of
this Section 9, the term "total disability" shall mean Executives inability,
as a result of illness or injury, to perform the normal duties of his
employment for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days.



(b) Employer may terminate Executives employment at any time for any reason;
provided, however, if Employer terminates Executive other than For Cause, or
if Executive terminates his employment for "Good Reason" (as defined below),
Executive shall continue to receive the amount of his then current base salary
until the 3rd anniversary of the Effective Date (to be paid with the
same frequency as Executives salary was paid prior to termination), and all
rights and obligations specified in Section 8(a) shall survive such
termination until the 3rd anniversary of the Effective Date. Other than the
payment provided for in this Section 9(b), Executive acknowledges that he
shall not be entitled to any other payments, benefits or damages from Employer
in connection with a termination of Executive by Employer other than For Cause
or a termination by Executive for Good Reason, and Executive hereby waives
all rights and claims with respect thereto. "Good Reason" means a material
breach of this Agreement by Employer after Executive has notified Employer of
such breach in writing and Employer has failed to cure such breach within 30
days of receipt of such notice.



(c) If Executive resigns or terminates his employment hereunder for any
reason (other than Good Reason) prior to the 3rd anniversary of the Effective
Date, (i) he must provide at  



 

4 ##### Table of Contents

  

 least 30 days prior written notice of such resignation or termination, (ii)
all rights and obligations specified in Section 8(a) shall survive any
such termination until the 3rd anniversary of the Effective Date, (iii)
Executive shall not be entitled to any further compensation or benefits from
Employer, and (iv) Employer shall be entitled to all remedies available under
this Agreement and applicable law. Upon receipt of any such notice of
termination, Employer may elect, at its sole option, to have Executives
resignation or termination effective immediately. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, at Employers sole option and election, Employer may
continue paying to Executive the minimum cash compensation provided for
in Section 4(a) for any period up to, but not to extend past, the 3rd
anniversary of the Effective Date (each such payment, a "Continuation
Payment"), and all rights and obligations specified in Section 8(a) shall
survive until the later of (A) the 3rd anniversary of the Effective Date or
(B) the 1st anniversary of the date of the final Continuation Payment.
Continuation Payments, if any, would be made with the same frequency as
Executives salary was paid prior to any such termination.



(d) The provisions of Section 7 and Section 8 shall in all cases survive the
termination of this Agreement and the termination of Executives employment,
whether voluntary or involuntary.



10\. _Notice_. For the purposes of this Agreement, notices and demands shall
be deemed given when mailed by United States mail, addressed in the case of
Bank to [ _ _] Attention: Chairman of the Board of
Directors, with a copy to ANB at Alabama National BanCorporation, 1927 First
Avenue North, Birmingham, Alabama 35203, Attention: Chief Executive Officer;
or in the case of Executive, to his last known address of record contained in
the Banks personnel files.



11\. _Miscellaneous_. No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived
or discharged unless such modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in
writing. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this
Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida without
regard to principles of conflicts of laws. This Agreement supersedes and
cancels any prior employment agreement or understanding entered into between
Executive and Bank, including but not limited to that certain Employment
Agreement dated January 6, 2003. 



12\. _Validity_. Should any court of competent jurisdiction, arbitrator or
other judicial body decide, hold, adjudge or decree that any provision, clause
or term of this Agreement is invalid, void or unenforceable, such
determination shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, and all
other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as if
such void or unenforceable provision, clause or term had not been included
herein. Such determination shall not be deemed to affect the validity or
enforceability of this entire Agreement in any other situation or
circumstance, and the parties agree that the scope of this Agreement is
intended to extend to Employer the maximum protection permitted by law. The
parties expressly deem the length of time and the size of the territory
provided for in Section 8 of this Agreement to be reasonable. If, however, any
judicial body or arbitrator decides, holds, adjudges or decrees that the
length of time and/or the size of the territory provided for in Section 8 of
this Agreement is/are unreasonable, then it is the express intent of the
parties that such court determine the length of time and/or size of the
territory that is/are reasonable and that such court enforce the terms of this
Agreement in accordance with such determination.

13\. _Arbitration_.



(a) Except as may otherwise hereinafter be provided, any dispute or
controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be
settled exclusively by arbitration in Orlando, Florida, in accordance with the
rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The agreement
set forth herein to arbitrate shall be specifically enforceable under
the prevailing arbitration law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employer shall
have the right to seek enforcement by preliminary injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief of the provisions of Section 7 and/or 8
hereof in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction without regard
to whether any such claim has been or can be referred to arbitration.



(b) The parties hereto (i) acknowledge that they have read and understood the
provisions of this Section regarding arbitration and (ii) that performance of
this Agreement will be interstate commerce as that term is used in the Federal
Arbitration Act, and the parties contemplate substantial interstate activity
in the performance of this Agreement including, but not limited to, interstate
travel, the use of interstate phone lines, the use of the U.S. mail services
and other interstate courier services.



(c) Notice of the demand for arbitration shall be filed in writing with the
other party to this Agreement and with the American Arbitration
Association. The demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable
time after the claim, dispute or other matter in question has arisen, and in
no event shall it be made after the date when institution of legal or
equitable proceedings based on such claim, dispute or other matter in
question would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The award
rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and judgment may be entered upon it
in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.



14\. _Parties_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of any successors or assigns to Bank or ANB. Executive may not assign
any of his rights or delegate any of his duties or obligations under this
Agreement or any portion hereof. 



15\. _Waiver of Claims_. In consideration of the obligations of Employer
hereunder, Executive, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
unconditionally releases Employer, its directors, officers, employees and
shareholders, from any and all claims, liabilities and obligations of any
nature pertaining to termination of Executives employment by Employer,
including but not limited to (a) any claims under federal, state or local laws
prohibiting discrimination, including without limitation the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, or (b) any claims
growing out of any alleged legal restrictions on Employers right to terminate
Executives employment, such as any alleged implied contract of employment or
termination contrary to public policy. Executive acknowledges that he has
been advised to consult with an attorney prior to signing this Agreement, that
he has had no less than 21 days to consider this Agreement prior to execution
hereof, and that he may revoke this Agreement at any time within 7 days
following the execution hereof by written notice to Employer.



16\. _Tax Withholding_. All compensation payable pursuant to this Agreement,
including without limitation severance compensation, shall be subject to
reduction by all applicable withholding, social security and other federal,
state and local taxes and deductions.

_BY HAND DELIVERY_



Indian River Banking Company

958 20th Place

Vero Beach, Florida 32960

Attn: Chairman



     | Re: | _Merger of Indian River Banking Company and Alabama
Nationa_ _l BanCorporation_ 
---|---|--- 



Gentlemen:



We are counsel to Alabama National BanCorporation ("ANB"), a corporation
organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and have
represented ANB in connection with the execution and delivery of the Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 22, 2003 (the "Agreement"), by and
between Indian River Banking Company ("IRBC") and ANB. This opinion
is delivered pursuant to Section 9.3(d) of the Agreement. Capitalized terms
used in this opinion shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement.



_[Mutually agreeable, customary assumptions and qualifications to be
inserted.]_



Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:



1\. ANB is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware with full corporate
power and authority to carry on the business in which it is engaged, as
described in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and to own the properties owned
by it.



2\. The execution and delivery of the Agreement by ANB, and ANBs compliance
with its terms, do not and will not violate or contravene any provision of the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of ANB. To the best of our
knowledge but without any independent investigation, the execution and
delivery of the Agreement, and compliance with its terms, do not and will not
result in any conflict with, breach of, or default or acceleration under any
mortgage, agreement, lease, indenture or other instrument, order, judgment or
decree to which any ANB Company is a party or by which any ANB Company is
bound.



 

D-1 ##### Table of Contents

  

3\. In accordance with the Bylaws of ANB and pursuant to resolutions duly
adopted by its Board of Directors, the Agreement has been duly adopted and
approved by the Board of Directors of ANB.



4\. The Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by ANB.
Assuming valid authorization, execution and delivery by IRBC, the Agreement
constitutes the valid and binding agreement of ANB, enforceable against ANB
in accordance with its terms.



5\. The authorized capital stock of ANB consists of 27,500,000 shares of ANB
Common Stock, of which [ _ _] shares were issued and
outstanding as of [ _ _], and 100,000 shares of preferred
stock, $1.00 par value, none of which is issued and outstanding. The shares of
ANB Common Stock that are issued and outstanding were not issued in violation
of any statutory preemptive rights of shareholders. The shares of ANB Common
Stock to be issued to the stockholders of IRBC as contemplated by the
Agreement are duly authorized, and when properly issued and delivered
following consummation of the Merger will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable.



     

Very truly yours,
