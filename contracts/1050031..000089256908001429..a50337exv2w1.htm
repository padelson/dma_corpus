units and any other equity or equity-based awards (including cash-settled awards), if any,

Knowledge of the Company, each Company Option that is intended to qualify as an &#147;incentive stock
option&#148; under
Section&nbsp;422 of the Code so qualifies, and the exercise price of each other Company Option is
no less than the fair market value of a Share as determined on the date of grant of such Company
Option. The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of all Stock Plans and
the forms of all agreements evidencing outstanding equity or equity based awards thereunder. The
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity securities of each of the Company&#146;s
Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the
Company or by a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any
