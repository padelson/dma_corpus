AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 31, 2008 (this " _Agreement_ "), by and among SMandA, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), Project Victor Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and Project Victor Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "). The Company and Merger Sub are sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Constituent Corporations_ ". 

   

 _R_ _E_ _C_ _I_ _T_ _A_ _L_ _S_ : 

   

 WHEREAS, the parties to this Agreement desire to effect the acquisition of the Company by Parent through a merger of the Company and Merger Sub; 

   

 WHEREAS, in furtherance of the foregoing and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), the respective boards of directors or comparable governing bodies of each of Parent, Merger Sub and, based upon the recommendation of the special committee of its Board of Directors (the " _Special Committee_ "), the Company have approved and adopted this Agreement, the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company with the Company as the Surviving Corporation (the " _Merger_ "), and the other transactions contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

   

 WHEREAS, the board of directors or comparable governing bodies of each of Parent, Merger Sub and, based upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, the Company have determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests of their respective equityholders and have recommended that their respective equityholders adopt this Agreement; 

   

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition to the willingness of the Company to enter into this Agreement, Odyssey Investment Partners Fund III, LP (the " _Guarantor_ ") is executing and delivering to the Company a limited guaranty in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Limited Guaranty_ "), with respect to certain of Parents obligations under this Agreement; and 

   

 WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger as provided in this Agreement. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, each intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE IV 

   

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;_ 
  _EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_   

  

 4.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company: 

  

 (a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (each, a " _Share_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares, Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned or held in treasury by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (each, an " _Excluded Share_ ")) shall be converted into the right to receive $6.25 per Share in cash, without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Taxes as described in _Section 4.2(f)_ (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate formerly representing any of the Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share (other than the Dissenting Shares, which are addressed in clause (d) below) referred to in _Section 4.1(a)_, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. 

   

 (c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

    ##### 

  

  

 (d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a holder thereof who has not voted in favor of the Merger and who is entitled to demand and validly demands payment of the fair value for such Shares as determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but instead shall be converted into the right to receive payment from the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the DGCL, unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right under the DGCL. If any such holder of Shares shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, each Share of such holder shall be treated as a Share that had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with  _Section 4.1(a)_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any written demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall have the right to reasonably participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle, any such demands. 

   

 4.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent and/or Merger Sub shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make all payments under  _Section 4.1(a)_ and _Section 4.3(a)_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;  _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or guarantied by the United States of America, or in commercial paper obligations rated A1 or P1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under _Section 4.1(a)_ and _Section 4.3(a)_ shall be paid to Parent, upon demand. To the extent that there are losses with respect to any such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment under _Section 4.1(a)_ and _Section 4.3(a)_, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments required under  _Section 4.1(a)_ and _Section 4.3(a)_. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of Dissenting Shares or Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in  _Section 4.2(e)_) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and to have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 4.2(e)_) in 

   ##### 

  

   

exchange for the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
_Section 4.2(e)_ ) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such
letter of transmittal, and such letter of transmittal having been duly
completed and validly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in
immediately available funds (less any required Tax withholdings as provided
in _Section 4.2(f)_) equal to (A) the number of Shares represented by such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
4.2(e)_), multiplied by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled and extinguished
of no further force or effect. No interest will accrue or be paid on any
amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due
surrender of the Certificate may be issued to the transferee of such Shares
if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the
Paying Agent, properly endorsed with signature guaranteed, accompanied by all
documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are
not applicable. 

   

 (c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and extinguished and exchanged for the Per Share Merger Consideration (payable in cash in immediately available funds) to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article IV_. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the securityholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than Dissenting Shares or Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this _Article IV_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(f)_ ) upon due surrender of each of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 4.2(e)_), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation, general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature. 

   

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond as Parent or the Paying Agent may deem reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (less any required Tax deductions or withholdings as provided 

    ##### 

  

 

in  _Section 4.2(f)_) equal to the number of Shares represented by such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger
Consideration. 

   

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may be. 

   

 4.3 _Treatment of Stock Plans_. 

  

 (a) _Options; RSUs_. 

   

 (i) At the Effective Time: Each outstanding Company Option granted under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan and the Second Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan, other than the Assumed Options, shall become fully vested and be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three Business Days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Company Option, less any applicable Taxes required to be deducted or withheld with respect to such payment. As used herein, the term " _Company Option_ " shall mean any outstanding option to purchase Shares under any Stock Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Parent may mutually agree prior to the date that is five (5) Business Days before the Closing Date that certain Company Options will not become fully vested and be cancelled as provided above and instead be assumed by Parent concurrently with the consummation of the Merger (any Company Option to be so assumed, an " _Assumed Option_ "). 

  

 (ii) At the Effective Time: Each Assumed Option, shall be converted into an option to acquire, on substantially similar terms and conditions applicable to such Assumed Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for the adjustments provided herein), the number of shares of common stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ "), that is equal to the product, rounded down to the nearest whole share, of (i) the number of Shares subject to such Assumed Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Option Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient, rounded down to the nearest whole cent, of (x) the exercise price per Share applicable under such Assumed Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing adjustments shall comply with Sections 424(a) and 409A of the Code and the Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretative guidance issued 

   ##### 

  

 

thereunder. As used herein, the term " _Option Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Per Share Merger Consideration and
the denominator of which is the per share fair market value of the Parent
Common Stock as of immediately following the Effective Time (as determined in
good faith by Parent). 

   

 (iii) At the Effective Time: Each outstanding Company RSU granted under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan pursuant to the 20072009 Long Term Incentive Plan and 20082010 Long Term Incentive Plan implemented under the Executive Incentive Plan shall become fully vested and be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three Business Days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the total number of Shares subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less any applicable Taxes required to be deducted or withheld with respect to such payment. As used herein, the term " _Company RSU_ " shall mean any outstanding restricted stock unit granted under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan pursuant to the 20072009 Long Term Incentive Plan or 20082010 Long Term Incentive Plan implemented under the Executive Incentive Plan. 

  

 (b) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt resolutions and take all such other actions reasonably required to (i) implement the provisions of _Section 4.3(a)_, (ii) ensure that the Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall terminate and (iii) ensure that no holder of any Company Options (other than Assumed Options) or Company RSUs or any participant in any Stock Plan or other employee benefit arrangement of the Company shall have any rights to acquire, or other rights in respect of, the capital stock of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, except the right to receive the payment contemplated by _Section 4.3(a)_ in cancellation and settlement thereof. 

   

 4.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes the number of Shares, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), division or subdivision of Shares, stock dividend or distribution, consolidation of Shares, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 4.4_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE V 

   

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_   

  

 5.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered to Parent by the Company in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being understood that any matter disclosed in any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed in any other section of the Company Disclosure Schedule if (i) it is readily apparent 

   ##### 

  

 

from such disclosure that it applies to such other section or (ii) such
disclosure is cross-referenced in such other section), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that: 

   

 (a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted, and (iii) is qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except in the case of clause (iii) where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

As of the date of this Agreement, the Limited Guaranty has not been amended or modified in any respect. 

   

 (h) _Ownership of Shares_.

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 6.2(b)(iii)_ to the contrary, if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal which the board of directors of the Company

concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisors, and taking into account adjustments to the terms of this
Agreement that may be offered by Parent pursuant to this  _Section 6.2(e)_,
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the board of directors of the Company may at
any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, if it determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take
such action or any of the actions described in the following clauses (x), (y)
and (z) would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the board of
directors to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, (x)
withhold, withdraw, modify, qualify, or amend or propose publicly to
withhold, withdraw, modify, qualify, or amend, in a manner adverse to Parent
or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation (a " _Change of Company
Recommendation_ "), (y) approve or recommend such Superior Proposal, and/or
(z) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the board
of directors of the Company may not withhold, withdraw, modify, qualify or
amend the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent pursuant to
the foregoing clause (x), approve or recommend such Superior Proposal pursuant
to the foregoing clause (y) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
foregoing clause (z) unless (A) such Superior Proposal did not result from a
breach by the Company of this _Section 6.2_; (B) the Company shall have
provided prior written notice to Parent of its intention to take any
action contemplated in this _Section 6.2(e)_ with respect to a Superior
Proposal at least four (4) Business Days in advance of taking such action,
which notice shall set forth the action the Company intends to take, the
material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including
the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and shall have
contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and other material
documents, including the then current form of each definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ "); and (C) during such four (4) Business Day period, the Company
shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. The Company shall
not withhold, withdraw, qualify, modify or amend the Company Recommendation in
a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub if, prior to the expiration of such
four (4) Business Day period, Parent makes a proposal to adjust the terms and
conditions of this Agreement that the board of the directors of the Company
