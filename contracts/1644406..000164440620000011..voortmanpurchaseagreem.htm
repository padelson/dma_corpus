Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on the Closing Date,
each Principal Seller shall sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase
from each Principal Seller, all (but not less than all) of the Purchased
Shares held thereby. The Purchased Shares will constitute at Closing, in the
aggregate, all (but not less than all) of the issued and outstanding shares in
the capital of Corporation.

2.2 Purchase Price.

Subject to adjustment, if any, in accordance with Section 2.4, the aggregate
purchase price payable by Purchaser for the Purchased Shares shall be an

minus the Principal Sellers\' Allocable Portion of the Adjustment Escrow
Amount, and minus the Principal Sellers\' Allocable Portion of the Escrow

statement (the "Preliminary Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement")
setting forth Corporation\'s good faith estimate of the Working Capital as of
the Effective Time (the "Preliminary Closing Date Net Working Capital
Amount"), which Preliminary Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement shall
be adjusted to include the Inventory Count conducted immediately prior to
Closing, and (ii) the Closing Indebtedness and Cash Statement, which shall set
forth Corporation\'s good faith estimate of the Net Indebtedness of the
Acquired Companies as of Effective Time. If the Preliminary Closing Date Net
Working Capital Amount is greater than the Target Working Capital, the
Purchase Price will be increased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such
excess, and if the Preliminary Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount is less
than the Target Working Capital, the Purchase Price will be decreased dollar-
for-dollar by the amount of such shortfall (the "Closing Net Working Capital
Adjustment"), provided that if the Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment is
less than $150,000 (positive or negative), no adjustment will be made. Within
two days prior to the Closing Date, Agent shall also cause Corporation to

shall prepare and shall deliver to Agent (i) a statement with the
determination of the Working Capital, prepared as of the Effective Time,

internal systems to be received by Independent Distributors and direct
shipments to the U.S. and Canada (excluding Foodservice and Global) and not on
the date such inventory was actually shipped, and (ii) a statement of Net
Indebtedness, the Optionholders Proportionate Adjustment Amount and the

and other matters relating to the preparation of the Draft Statements.

(e) Objection Period. Within 45 days following delivery of the Draft
Statements, Agent (for and on behalf of Sellers) shall notify Purchaser in
writing if they have any objections to the basis of each objection and the amounts in dispute (on an item-by-item
basis if there is more than one amount in dispute) together with Sellers\'
alternative proposed calculation with respect to each component of the Draft
Statements it disputes. Any item or amount of the Draft Statements not so
identified on the notice of objection as an item or amount in dispute shall be
deemed as final and binding. Sellers shall be deemed to have accepted the
Draft Statements in their entirety if Agent (for and on behalf of Sellers)
does not notify Purchaser of any objection within such period of 45 days.

the Draft Statements in accordance with Section 2.4(e), then Purchaser and

remaining in dispute may be submitted by Agent (for and on behalf of Sellers)
or Purchaser for final determination to BDO Canada LLP, or if such firm is
unwilling or unable to act, Grant Thornton LLP (in any such case, the "Third
Party Auditors"). Purchaser and Agent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Third Party Auditors to complete their work within 30
days of their engagement. The Third Party Auditors shall allow each of
Purchaser and Agent (for and on behalf of Sellers) to present their respective
positions regarding the items in dispute in the Draft Statements and the
determination of Working Capital and Net Indebtedness as of the Effective
Time, and each of Purchaser and Agent (for and on behalf of Sellers) shall
have the right to present additional documents, materials and other written
information to the Third Party Auditors regarding the items in dispute. The
Third Party Auditors shall consider such additional documents, materials and
other written information. Any such other documents, materials or other
written information shall be copied to each of Purchaser and Agent and each of
Purchaser and Agent shall be entitled to reply thereto. The Third Party
Auditors shall make their determination in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. The Third Party Auditors may not assign a dollar value to any
disputed item greater than the highest amount or less than the lowest amount
claimed by Purchaser or Agent, as applicable.

(g) Final Determination. Promptly following the 30-day period referred to in
Section 2.4(e) during which no notice of objection was given or the resolution
of any dispute in accordance with Section 2.4(f), as the case may be,
Purchaser shall deliver to Agent (for and on behalf of Sellers) the final
closing date balance sheet, a statement of final Working Capital and a final
statement of Net Indebtedness, Optionholders Proportionate Adjustment Amount
and Optionee Additional Withholding Amount (the "Final Statements"). The Final
Statements shall reflect the resolution of any dispute in accordance with

2.4(h)(iii) is owed by Purchaser (and SPC Investment in respect of any portion
of such sum included in the calculation of the Optionholders Proportionate

(excluding the sum of any portion thereof relating to the Optionholders
Proportionate Adjustment Amount (positive) and the Optionee Additional
Withholding Amount); Principal Sellers to the accounts designated by Agent pursuant to Section 2.3
and to Agent to the account(s) designated thereby for remittance to
Optionholders, in each case by way of wire transfer of immediately available
funds;

Optionholders Proportionate Adjustment Amount (positive) and the Optionee
Additional Withholding Amount, to Principal Sellers, by way of wire transfer
of immediately available funds to accounts designated by Agent pursuant to
Section 2.3;

for remittance to Optionholders, by way of wire transfer of immediately

any portion of such sum included in the calculation of the Optionholders
Proportionate Adjustment Amount) (the "Net Downward Adjustment") and the Net
Downward Adjustment is greater than or equal to the Adjustment Escrow Amount,

immediately available funds to an account designated by SPC Investment.

(i) Fees and Expenses. Sellers and Purchaser shall bear the fees and expenses

by Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, based on the
percentage which the portion of the contested amounts not awarded to Sellers,

actually contested by such Party. For example, if closing accounts receivable
is the only disputed item, and Sellers claim that closing accounts receivable
is $1,000; and Purchaser contest only $500 of the amount claimed by Sellers,
and if the Third Party Auditors ultimately resolve the dispute by awarding
Sellers $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Third
Party Auditors will be allocated 60% (i.e. 300 / 500) to Purchaser and 40%
(i.e. 200 / 500) to Sellers. Sellers and Purchaser will, however, bear their
own fees and expenses in presenting their respective cases to the Third Party
Auditors. (a) On the Closing Date immediately prior to Closing, Purchaser shall:

(i) lend to the applicable Acquired Companies (pursuant to non-interest
bearing, demand promissory notes) an aggregate amount equal to the Net

the Closing Indebtedness and Cash Statement the amounts of Indebtedness set
forth beside such Persons\' respective names by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to accounts designated in writing by Agent prior to the
Closing Date. The Indebtedness Not Payable at Closing shall remain
outstanding; and

(ii) lend to SPC Investment or the relevant Acquired Company (pursuant to non-
interest bearing, demand promissory notes) an amount equal to the sum of (A)
the Optionee Withholding Amount, and (B) the aggregate principal amount of the
Net Settlement Notes, and (C) minus the Optionholders\' Allocable Portion of
any unpaid Transaction Expenses. Optionholders hereby direct (and Principal
Sellers shall cause SPC Investment to direct) Purchaser to pay at Closing the
Optionholders\' Allocable Portion of the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the
Optionholders\' Allocable Portion of the Escrow Indemnity Amount to the Escrow
Agent. Purchaser shall cause SPC Investment (or the relevant Acquired Company)
to remit the Optionee Withholding Amount (if any) to the appropriate
Governmental Entities at the relevant time.

(b) On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay, to the Persons listed on Part A
of the Closing Indebtedness and Cash Statement the amounts of unpaid

accounts designated in writing by Agent prior to the Closing Date.

addition to any other rights it may have under this Agreement (including to

representations, warranties or covenants) or otherwise (including specific
performance), and the exercise of a right of termination will not constitute
an election of remedies.

points thereof) for inspection and copying (at Sellers\' expense, provided

Return 15 days prior to the due date (taking into account any extensions
obtained) on which such amended return must be filed with the appropriate
taxing authorities. Agent (for and on behalf of Sellers) shall have the right
to review the draft of the Tax Returns provided to them by Purchaser and make

item on any such Tax Return, Purchaser and Agent (for and on behalf of
Sellers) shall follow the notification and dispute resolution procedure set
out in Section 8.3(b) to finally resolve the matter except that the references
therein to 10 days shall be read as references to five (5) days.

(b) Filing of Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Periods. Purchaser will cause each
of the Acquired Companies to prepare and file all Tax Returns for each of the
Acquired Companies that are due after the Closing Date in respect of any Pre-
Closing Tax Period basis and in accordance with applicable Law. Purchaser shall provide Agent
(for and on behalf of Sellers) with a draft of such Tax Returns 30 days prior
to the due date (taking into account any extensions obtained) for filing the
Tax Returns with the appropriate taxing authorities. Agent (for and on behalf
of Sellers) shall have the right to review the draft of the Tax Returns
provided to them by Purchaser and make any reasonable comments that they deem
appropriate, which comments shall be accepted by Purchaser. If Agent (for and
on behalf of Sellers) objects to any item on any such Tax Return, it shall,
within 10 days after delivery of such Tax Return, notify Purchaser in writing
that it so objects, specifying with reasonable particularity any such item and
stating the specific factual or legal basis for any such objection. If a
notice of objection is duly delivered, Purchaser and Agent (for and on behalf
of Sellers) shall negotiate in good faith and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such items. If the Purchaser and Agent are
unable to reach such agreement within 10 days after delivery of the notice of
objection, the disputed items shall be resolved by the Third Party Auditors
and any determination by the Third Party Auditors shall be final. The Third
Party Auditors shall resolve any disputed items within 10 days of having the
item referred to them pursuant to such procedures as it may require. If the
Third Party Auditors are unable to resolve any disputed items before the due
date (taking into account any extensions obtained) for such Tax Return, the
Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by the Purchaser and then amended to
reflect the Third Party Auditors\' resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of
the Third Party Auditors shall be borne equally by the Purchaser and Agent.

not relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be exclusively within the control
of the Purchaser.

connection between any Acquired Company and any U.S. state or local taxing
jurisdiction, Purchaser, acting in good faith, determines that it is required
to file a Tax Return in such U.S. state or local taxing jurisdiction for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, Purchaser shall take such steps as are necessary to
file such return and shall provide Agent (for and on behalf of Sellers) with a
draft of such Tax Return 30 days prior to the due date (taking into account
any extensions obtained) for filing the Tax Return (or, in the case of a non-
income Tax Return, the times for review shall be appropriately adjusted to
take into account the number of days from the end of the Tax period to the due
date, taking into account extensions, of the Tax Return) with the appropriate
taxing authorities. If Agent (for and on behalf of Sellers) objects to any
item on any such Tax Return, Purchaser and Agent (for and on behalf of
Sellers) shall follow the notification and dispute resolution procedure set
out in Section 8.3(b) to finally resolve the matter.

(d) Refunds. Other than amounts applied to reduce the quantum of any loss or
monetary remedy payable by the insurers to the Purchaser pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the Representation and Warranty Policy, any refunds of Taxes
(or credit for overpayment of Taxes) of any of the Acquired Companies,
including any interest actually received (or credited) with respect thereto,
from the applicable taxing authorities for any period ending on or before the
Closing (including refunds arising from amended returns filed after the
Closing Date) shall be for the account of Sellers and, if received by (or
credited to) Purchaser or any of the Acquired Companies shall be paid, net of
any Tax costs incurred or accrued on account of the receipt of such refund by
the Acquired Companies receipt, to Sellers within 10 calendar days after Purchaser or any of the
Acquired Companies receives such refund (or is credited with such over
payment). At the request of Agent (for and on behalf of Sellers), Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Acquired Companies to
pursue claims for refunds for periods ending on or before the Closing.

(e) Options. Purchaser will cause the relevant Acquired Company to file the
election described in subsection 110(1.1) of the Tax Act (and undertake the
other procedures described therein) on a timely basis after the Closing Date
so that the Optionholders are not prohibited from claiming the deduction under
paragraph 110(1)(d) of the Tax Act in respect of the surrender of such Options
in accordance with Section2.6(c)(i). Purchaser will also cause the relevant
Acquired Company to issue amended remuneration statements for tax purposes in
connection with the net amounts received by the Optionholders under Section
2.6(c)(i), should those amounts have been subject to a reduction pursuant to
Sections 2.6(c)(i) or 2.6(c)(i).

(f) Section 338 Election. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, neither Purchaser, nor any of the Acquired Companies shall, without
the written consent of Agent (for and on behalf of Sellers) make or change any
Tax election that has retroactive effect to any taxation year, or portion
thereof, ending on or before the Closing (including any election under Section
338 of the Code) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(g) Section 256(9) Election. Purchaser and Sellers hereby covenant and agree
that each of the Acquired Companies shall make an election pursuant to
subsection 256(9) of the Tax Act in respect of any acquisition of control of
the Acquired Companies that occurs as a result of the acquisition of the
Purchased Shares by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement. Purchaser agrees
that it shall take all steps necessary to ensure that such election is
included in the income tax return for each Acquired Company for the taxation
year ending immediately before Closing.

(h) Cooperation. Purchaser and Agent (for and on behalf of Sellers) shall
cooperate, to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns, and any claim, action, suit, audit
or similar proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon the other Party\'s request) the provision of records
and information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return filing
and/or such claim, action, suit, audit or similar proceeding with respect to
Taxes and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation with respect to such records and
information. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall
or shall cause the Acquired Companies to provide within a reasonable period
following such request (but in no case more than (30) days from the date of
such request) any information available to Purchaser or any Acquired Company
that is requested by Agent (for and on behalf of Sellers) to permit Sellers or
any beneficial owners of Sellers to perform any necessary Tax
calculations/determinations and make any required Tax filings.

induce Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, SPC hereby covenants and agrees
with Purchaser that SPC shall not directly or indirectly to, for a period of
18 months from the Closing Date, offer employment to, or solicit or have

failure to act of Purchaser or its Affiliates), then Purchaser shall be
entitled to make a claim for such Damages against the Escrow Indemnity Amount.

Purchaser pursuant hereto. The maximum aggregate liability of Sellers for
Damages based on claims pursuant to (A) Section 9.2(b)(vii) shall be limited
to $500,000, and (B) Section 9.2(b)(viii) shall be limited to $100,000.

or warranty or Damages calculated in respect of such breach or inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained
in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty (the
"Materiality Scrape"), provided, however, that the Materiality Scrape will not
apply to the representations and warranties set out in Section 3.2(u)
(Financial Statements and Financial Controls) to the extent materiality
qualifiers are contained in ASPE, the definition of Material Contracts in
Section 3.2(y) (Contracts) or Section 3.2(w) (Material Adverse Change), nor
will the Materiality Scrape affect the materiality qualifications or
limitations applicable to the conditions set out in Sections 6.2(a) and
6.4(a). The amount of the Damages suffered by Purchaser shall be reduced to
the extent of any Tax benefit available to Purchaser arising in connection
with the accrual, incurrence or payment of any such Damages (including the net
present value of any Tax benefit arising in subsequent taxable years). The
amount of the Damages suffered by Purchaser shall include the net present
value of any net Tax cost incurred by the Purchaser arising from the receipt
of indemnity payments under this Agreement.

Promptly upon obtaining knowledge thereof, the Party seeking indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement (the "Indemnified Party") shall notify the other
Party in writing (the "Indemnifying Party") of any cause which the Indemnified
Party has determined has given rise to indemnification under this Article 9,
provided that no failure to provide such notice promptly, unless the
notification occurs after the expiration of the specified period set out in
Section 9.1, shall limit the rights of the Indemnified Party or Parties to
indemnification hereunder in respect of any such facts, circumstances or
cause, except to the claim may be asserted nor may any action be commenced against an Indemnifying
Party for breach of any representation, warranty or covenant, contained
herein, unless such written notice of such claim or action is received by the
Indemnifying Party describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
with respect to the subject matter of such claim or action on or prior to the
date on which the representation, warranty or covenant on which such claim or
action is based ceases to survive as set forth in this Agreement, irrespective
of whether the subject matter of such claim or action shall have occurred
before or after such date.

9.8 Defense of Third Party Claim.

(a) If any legal proceeding shall be instituted or any claim or demand shall
be asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party (each a "Third
Party Claim"), then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its
expense, after receipt of the Indemnified Party\'s notice under Section 9.7
and upon giving notice to the Indemnified Party within 20 Business Days of
such receipt, to defend the Third Party Claim at its own cost and expense with
counsel of its own selection, provided that:

writing complete responsibility for, and agrees to indemnify the Indemnified
Party in respect of all Damages relating to the Third Party Claim, subject to
the limitations set forth in this Article 9, as applicable;

(ii) the Indemnifying Party furnishes evidence to the Indemnified Party
whenever required by the Indemnified Party, which is satisfactory to the

participate in the defense at its own expense;

be permitted to control and defend the Third Party Claim if such Third Party
Claim:

(iv) seeks injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party;
or

(v) involves criminal liability.

(b) If the Indemnifying Party fails within 20 Business Days from receipt of
the notice of a Third Party Claim to give notice of its intention to defend
the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 9.8, then the Indemnifying
Party shall be deemed to have waived its right to defend the Third Party Claim
and the Indemnified Party shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
undertake or to cause the Indemnifying Party to undertake the defence of the
Third Party Claim and compromise and settle the Third Party Claim on behalf,
for the account and at the risk and expense of the Indemnifying Party,
provided that such Third Party Claim may not be settled or compromised by the
Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(c) If, having elected to assume control of the defense of a Third Party Claim
as contemplated by Section 9.8(a), the Indemnifying Party thereafter fails to
conduct the diligence, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume such control
and the Indemnified Party shall be bound by the results obtained by the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.

(d) Where the defence of a Third Party Claim is being undertaken and
controlled by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make available to the Indemnifying Party
those employees whose assistance, testimony or presence is necessary to assist
the Indemnifying Party in evaluating and defending any such claims.

(e) With respect to any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall make
available to the Indemnifying Party or its representatives on a timely basis
all documents, records and other materials in the possession of the
Indemnified Party, reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party for its use
in defending any such claim and shall otherwise cooperate on a timely basis
with the Indemnifying Party in the defence of such claim.

9.9 Payments.

(a) Any amount due to an Indemnified Party from an Indemnifying Party pursuant
to this Article 9 shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified
Party not later than five days following the final determination of an
indemnification claim by way of wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by the Indemnified Party.

(b) Any amounts payable by or to Principal Sellers under this Article 9 shall
be deemed to be adjustments to the Purchase Price and any amounts payable by
or to Optionholders under this Article 9 shall be deemed to be adjustments to
the "in-the-money" value of the Options, as applicable

9.10 Remedies.

Except pursuant to Section 10.3 and except for the rights of the Purchaser
under the Representation and Warranty Policy, the Parties agree that (a)
following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of Article 9 shall be
the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties, and (b) notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, no breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the
part of any Party, after the Closing, to rescind this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

10.8 Appointment of Agent.

(a) In order to administer efficiently the determination of certain matters
under this Agreement, each Seller grants to SPC (the "Agent") its respective
mandate to act as each such Seller\'s agent with respect to all matters under
this Agreement, other than as contemplated in this Section 10.8.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Agent has full power and
authority to make all decisions and take all actions relating to Sellers\'
respective rights, obligations and remedies under this Agreement including to
receive and make payments, to receive and send notices (including notices of
termination), to receive and deliver documents, to exercise, enforce or waive
rights or conditions, to give releases and discharges, to seek indemnification
on behalf of Sellers and to defend against indemnification claims of
Purchaser. All decisions and actions taken by Agent are binding upon all
Sellers, and no Seller has the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise
contest the same.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else contained in this
Agreement, Agent shall not have the authority to do anything on behalf any
Seller (other than itself only) that will or might have the result of
increasing the liability of any Seller hereunder or decreasing the Purchase
Price payable to any Seller other than in respect of settling adjustments to
the Purchase Price contemplated hereby.

(d) Purchaser is entitled to deal only with Agent in respect of all matters
arising under this Agreement including to receive and make payments, to
receive and send notices (including notices of termination), to receive and
deliver documents, to exercise, enforce or waive rights or conditions, to give
releases and discharges, to seek indemnification against Sellers or any one of
them and to defend against indemnification claims of Sellers.

(e) All references in this Agreement to decisions and actions to be taken by
Sellers or any one of them, as the case may be, are deemed taken by Sellers or
any one of them, as the case may be, if such decisions or actions are taken by
Agent. All references in this Agreement to decisions and actions to be taken
by Purchaser and directed to Sellers or of them, as the case may be, if such decisions or actions are directed by
Purchaser to Agent.

(f) In no event will Purchaser be held responsible or liable for the
application or allocation of any monies paid to Agent by Purchaser, and
Purchaser will be entitled to rely upon any notice provided to Purchaser by
Agent or action taken by Agent acting within the scope of its authority. All
monies received by Agent hereunder for the account of Sellers shall be held by
Agent in trust for Sellers and shall be paid to Sellers, to each to Seller to
the extent entitled thereto hereunder or for the account of whom such monies
are held, reasonably promptly upon receipt.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no payment, notice, receipt or delivery of
documents, exercise, enforcement or waiver of rights or conditions,
indemnification claim or indemnification or a principal defence will be
ineffective by reason only of it having been made or given to or by a Seller,
as the case may be, directly if each of Purchaser and such Seller consent by
virtue of not objecting to such dealings without the intermediary of Agent.

10.9 Amendments.

This Agreement may only be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified by
written agreement signed by Purchaser and Sellers, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld.

10.10 Waiver.

Subject to Section 10.8(c), no waiver of any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other provision
(whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver be binding unless executed in
writing by Agent (for and on behalf of Sellers) or by Purchaser, as the case
may be.

No failure on the part of any Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising
any right under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right; nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or
further exercise of such right or the exercise of any other right.

10.11 Non-Merger.

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the covenants,
representations and warranties shall not merge on and shall survive the
Closing and, notwithstanding such Closing and any investigation made by or on
behalf of any Party, shall continue in full force and effect.

10.12 Entire Agreement.

This Agreement together with the agreements referred to herein constitutes the
entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the
Parties. There are no representations, warranties, covenants, conditions or
other agreements, express or implied, collateral, statutory or otherwise,
between the Parties in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement
except as specifically set forth herein and neither Party has relied or is
relying on any other information, discussion or understanding in entering into
and completing the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when executed and delivered by the
Parties and after that time shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

10.14 Assignment.

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations under this
Agreement shall be assignable or transferable by either Party without the
prior written consent of the other Party, provided that (i) Purchaser may
assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement at any time, in whole
or in part, without the consent of the other Parties to any Affiliate(s) of
Purchaser so long as Purchaser and Purchaser Parent remain liable for the
performance of their respective obligations and liabilities hereunder; and
(ii) Purchaser may after the Closing assign its rights under this Agreement to
any of its financing sources pursuant to the terms of any related debt
financing obtained to complete the transactions contemplated this Agreement
for the purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning
this Agreement as collateral in respect of such Purchaser debt financing
obtained to complete the transactions contemplated this Agreement.

This Agreement shall override the Exhibits and Schedules annexed hereto to the
extent of any inconsistency.

10.16 Severability.

If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined by an arbitrator or any

provision shall be severed from this Agreement and the remaining provisions
shall continue in full force and effect.

10.17 Governing Law.

with the Laws of the province of Ontario and the federal Laws of Canada
applicable therein. Each Party irrevocably attorns and submits to the
