  This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of May 11, 2007, among Cardinal Health, Inc., an Ohio corporation (" _Parent_ "), Eagle Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and VIASYS Healthcare Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 

 WHEREAS, it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub shall commence a cash tender offer (such tender offer, as it may be amended and supplemented from time to time as permitted by this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") at a price per share equal to $42.75, plus, if the Appointment Time shall not have occurred on or prior to the 45th day after the date of this Agreement, an additional $0.007027 for each day during the period commencing on the 45th day after the date of this Agreement and ending on the date of the Appointment Time, net to the sellers in cash without interest (such amount or any greater amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer, the " _Offer Price_ ");

 

 WHEREAS, it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), pursuant to which each outstanding share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, without interest, except for (i) shares of Company Common Stock held by holders who comply with the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") regarding the right of stockholders to dissent from the Merger and require appraisal of their shares and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company or owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent;

 

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) approved this Agreement, (ii) determined that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and (iii) is recommending that the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholders_ ") accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock into the Offer, approve the Merger and adopt this Agreement, in each case, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

 

 WHEREAS, each of the Board of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub has (i) approved this Agreement and (ii) has determined that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of their respective corporations.

 

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:     ARTICLE I 
  
 THE OFFER 
--- 

 

      | SECTION 1.01. _The Offer_. 
---|--- 

 

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Article VII and none of the events or conditions set forth in Annex A (other than clause (e) of Annex A) shall have occurred and be existing and shall not have been waived by Parent or Merger Sub (the conditions set forth in Annex A, the " _Tender Offer Conditions_ "), Merger Sub shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")), as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement and in any event within 8 Business Days after the date of this Agreement, the Offer. Without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not decrease the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, decrease the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer, impose conditions to the Offer in addition to the Tender Offer Conditions, change or waive the Minimum Condition or, except as provided in Section 1.01(c), extend the expiration of the Offer beyond the initial Expiration Date, or amend any other term of the Offer in a manner adverse to the Company Stockholders; _provided_ that Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to increase the Offer Price and to waive any condition of the Offer, except the Minimum Condition. The Company agrees that no shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered in the Offer.

 

 (b) Merger Sub shall file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer on the date that the Offer is commenced, which Tender Offer Statement shall include an offer to purchase, form of transmittal letter and form of notice of guaranteed delivery (together with any supplements or amendments thereto, collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and, subject to the Companys compliance with Section 1.02(c), cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders in accordance with the applicable requirements of the U.S. federal securities laws. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each agree promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company Stockholders to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning Company that is required or reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the obligations relating to the Offer Documents contained in this Section 1.01(b) . The Company and its counsel shall be given the opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents sufficiently in advance of filing with the SEC or dissemination to the Company Stockholders.

 

 (c) Subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Offer shall remain open until midnight, New York City time, at the end of the 20th Business Day after the date that the Offer is commenced (the " _Expiration Date_ "), unless Merger Sub shall have extended the period of time for which the Offer is open pursuant to, and in accordance with, the two succeeding sentences or as may be required by applicable Law, in which event the term " _Expiration Date_ " 

  shall mean the latest time and date as the Offer, as so extended may expire;
_provided, however_ , that Merger Sub may, without the consent of Company, (i)
extend the Offer for one or more periods of not more than five Business Days
if, at the scheduled Expiration Date, any of the conditions of the Offer shall
not have been satisfied or waived; (ii) extend the Offer for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the
staff of the SEC (the " _SEC Staff_ ") thereof applicable to the Offer; or
(iii) if all of the Tender Offer Conditions are satisfied but the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that have been validly tendered and not
withdrawn in the Offer, together with any shares of Company Common Stock then
owned by Parent, is less than 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, commence a subsequent offering period (as provided in Rule 14d-11 under
the Exchange Act) for three to 20 Business Days to acquire outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock.

 

 (d) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and to satisfaction or waiver of the Tender Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause it to, as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date, accept for payment and pay for (after giving effect to any required withholding Tax) all shares of Company Common Stock that have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. If Merger Sub shall commence a subsequent offering period in connection with the Offer, Merger Sub shall accept for payment and pay for (after giving effect to any required withholding Tax) all additional shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered during such subsequent offering period.

 

      | SECTION 1.02. _Company Action_. 
---|--- 

 

 (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, and represents and warrants that the Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held, has, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, unanimously (i) approved this Agreement, and deemed this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company Stockholders; (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, in all respects, and such approval constitutes approval of the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL; and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company Stockholders accept the Offer, that the Company Stockholders tender their shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer to Merger Sub, and that the Company Stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger to the extent required by applicable Law (the " _Company Recommendation_ "). The Company consents to the inclusion of the Company Recommendation in the Offer Documents, subject to Section 4.02(b).

 

 (b) The Company hereby agrees to file with the SEC, as soon as reasonably practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 pertaining to the Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that, subject to Section 4.02(b), contains the Company Recommendation and to promptly mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the Company Stockholders together with the Offer Documents and cause the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by, and in accordance with the applicable requirements of the U.S. federal securities laws. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given the opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 

  14D-9 sufficiently in advance of its filing with the SEC. The Company will use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the U.S. federal
securities laws. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each agree promptly to
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to
the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated
to the Company Stockholders to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent
and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all information
concerning Parent and Merger Sub that is required or reasonably requested by
Company in connection with the obligations relating to the Schedule 14D-9
contained in this Section 1.02(b).

 

 (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company promptly will furnish (or cause its transfer agent to furnish) Parent and Merger Sub with mailing labels, security position listings and any available listing or computer files containing the names and addresses of the Company Stockholders, each as of a recent date, and shall furnish Merger Sub with such additional information and assistance (including updated lists of the Company Stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) as Merger Sub or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of shares of Company Common Stock. Except as required by applicable Law, and except as necessary to communicate the Offer, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the Company Stockholders, Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective representatives) shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information solely in connection with the Offer and the Merger, and, if this Agreement is terminated or the Offer is otherwise terminated, shall promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to the Company or destroy all copies of such information, labels, listings and files then in their possession or in the possession of their agents or representatives.

 

 (d) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Merger Option_ ") to purchase up to that number of newly issued shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Merger Option Shares_ ") equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and Merger Sub immediately following consummation of the Offer, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding on a fully diluted basis (after giving effect to the issuance of the Merger Option Shares) for consideration per Merger Option Share equal to the Offer Price.

 

 (e) The Merger Option shall be exercisable only after the purchase of and payment for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer by Parent or Merger Sub as a result of which Parent and Merger Sub own beneficially at least 80% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. The Merger Option shall not be exercisable if the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto exceeds the number of authorized shares of Company Common Stock available for issuance.

 

 (f) In the event that Parent or Merger Sub wish to exercise the Merger Option, Merger Sub shall give the Company one days prior written notice specifying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are or will be owned by Parent and Merger Sub immediately following consummation of the Offer and specifying a place and a time for the 

  closing of the purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following
receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Merger Sub specifying the
number of Merger Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Merger
Option Shares, the portion of the purchase price owing upon exercise of the
Merger Option that equals the product of (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock purchased pursuant to the Merger Option, multiplied by (ii) the
Offer Price, shall be paid to the Company, at the election of Parent and
Merger Sub, in cash (by wire transfer or cashiers check) or by delivery of a
promissory note having full recourse to Parent.

 (c) In the event that Parents designees are elected or designated to the Board of Directors of the Company, then, until the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Board of Directors of the Company to have at least two directors who are (i) directors on the date of this Agreement, (ii) independent directors for purposes of the continued listing requirements of 

  the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") and (iii) reasonably satisfactory

  SECTION 2.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws_. (a) The
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company
Certificate_ ") shall be amended at the Effective Time so that it is in
substantially the form as set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto (with such changes
or modifications as the Company and Parent may agree) and, as so amended, such
Company Certificate shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein and by
applicable Law.

 

  (b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part
of the Company and Merger Sub, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

 

  SECTION 2.06. _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors

of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal
or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the

the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further
deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or

Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this

authorized in the name of the Company or otherwise to take any and all such

  SECTION 2.09. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock, or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub:

 

 (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Any shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company shall remain outstanding after the Effective Time, appropriately adjusted such that such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the Company after the Merger as it owned immediately prior to the Merger.

 

 (c) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.09(b) and any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.10(b), without interest. The right of any holder of a Certificate to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable Tax Law.

 

 (d) _Dissenting Shares_.

 

 (i) Shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders who have not voted in favor of or consented to the Merger and who have properly demanded and perfected their rights to be paid the fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be canceled and the holder thereof shall not receive the Merger Consideration as compensation for such cancellation, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided, however_ , that if any such stockholder of the Company shall fail to perfect or shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such stockholders rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholders Dissenting Shares in respect of which the stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been canceled, at the Effective Time, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration (payable without any interest thereon) as compensation for such cancellation.

  (ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any notice received by the Company of intent to demand the fair value of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such notices and any other instruments or notices served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (B) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by an order, decree, ruling or injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction, make any payment or other commitment with respect to any such exercise of appraisal rights or offer to settle or settle any such rights.

 

 SECTION 2.10. _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.09(c). Any funds deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.10(a) shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in customary form and contain customary provisions) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of one or more Certificates shall, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of such Certificate or Certificates, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.09(c), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.10(b) may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.10(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any payment to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

 

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of 

   Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates. At the close
of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer,
it shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration to the
holder thereof as provided in this Article II.

 

  (d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for
six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent
shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration
in accordance with this Article II.

 

  (e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person
in respect of any funds from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to four years
after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

  (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the
cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be income
of Parent. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be
made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit
cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in
the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

 

  (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Article II.

 

  (h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent are required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts

  shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Certificates in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent.

Disclosure Schedule_ ") (with specific reference to the particular Section or
subsection of this Agreement to which the information set forth in such
disclosure schedule relates), Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to
the Company as follows:

 

  (a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated
and has all requisite corporate power and authority and possesses all
governmental licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to
enable it to use its corporate or other name and to own, lease or otherwise
hold and operate its properties and other assets and to carry on its business
as now being conducted, except where the failure to have such governmental
licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals individually or in the
aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect
to jurisdictions that recognize that concept) in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary,
other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified,
licensed or in good standing individually or in the aggregate has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Parent has made available to the Company complete and accurate copies of the
Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Certificate_ ")
and the Bylaws of Merger Sub, in each case as amended to the date hereof.

 

  (b) _Authority; Noncontravention_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has
all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver

Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger
Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (other than the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware). This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the
due authorization, execution

   and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, enforceable against Parent
and Merger Sub, as applicable, in accordance with its terms. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance by Parent and
Merger Sub with the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result in,
termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any obligation or
to the loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or
upon any of the properties or other assets of Parent or Merger Sub under (x)
Parent's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, Parent's
Code of Regulations, as amended, the Merger Sub Certificate or the Bylaws of

any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, rights of termination,
modification, cancellation or acceleration, losses or Liens that individually
or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to (1)
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (2) impair in any material respect the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its respective obligations under
this Agreement or (3) prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or
delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, action by or in
respect of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental
Entity is required by or with respect to Parent or Merger Sub in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub or
the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Offer, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (1) (A) the
filing of a premerger notification and report form by Parent under the HSR
Act and the termination of the waiting period required thereunder1 and (B) the
receipt, termination or expiration, as applicable, of approvals or waiting
periods required under any other applicable Antitrust Law, (2) the filing with
the SEC of (X) the Offer Documents by Merger Sub, (Y) the Schedule 14D-9 by
the Company and, if required by applicable Law, the Proxy Statement by the
Company and (Z) such reports under the Exchange Act as may be required in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (3) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, (4) any filings with and approvals of the
NYSE, (5) any filings required pursuant to state securities and "blue sky"
laws and (6) such other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, actions,
registrations, declarations and filings the failure of which to be obtained
or made individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to (x) have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (y) impair in any
material respect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its
respective obligations under this Agreement or (z) prevent or materially
impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

  (c) _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion
or incorporation by reference

   in the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 or the Proxy Statement will, on
the date that such document is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company
and during the pendency of the Offer and the subsequent offering period,
if any (in the case of the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9) and at the
time of the Company Stockholders' Meeting, if any (in the case of the Proxy
Statement), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by
Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer
Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 or the Proxy Statement. The Offer Documents

person (other than UBS Securities LLC) is entitled to any broker's, finder's,

Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties or
assets is or are subject to any Order, writ, judgment, injunction, settlement,

 (d) _Advice of Changes; Filings_. The Company and Parent shall promptly advise the other party orally and in writing if (i) any representation or warranty made by it (and, in the case of Parent, made by Merger Sub) contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate in a manner that would or would be reasonably likely to result in the failure of the condition set forth in Annex A or (ii) it (and, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it (and, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) under this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall, to the extent permitted by Law, promptly provide the other with copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than the portions of such filings that include confidential or proprietary information not directly related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Any Tax Returns described in this Section 4.01(e) shall be complete and correct in all material respects and shall be prepared

   on a basis consistent with the past practice of the Company. The Company
shall notify Parent upon the filing of any such material Tax Return and shall

refrained from performing, by the Covered Securityholders (and matters
incidental thereto) and (ii) shall not be calculated based on the number of
shares tendered or to be tendered into the Offer by the applicable Covered

by independent directors of the Company in accordance with the requirements
of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto and
(ii) the "safe harbor" provided pursuant to Rule 14d-10(d)(2) is otherwise

necessary actions by the Board of Directors of the Company, the Executive
Compensation Committee of such Board or its independent directors.

 

  SECTION 4.02. _No Solicitation_. (a) The Company shall not, nor shall
it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors, officers or employees or any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent,
representative or controlled Affiliate (collectively, " _Representatives_ ")
to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage, or take any other action designed to, or which could
reasonably be expected to, facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or the
making thereof, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
information, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Takeover Proposal or
(iii) waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any
contractual "standstill" or similar obligation of any person other than
Parent. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section 4.02(a)
by the Company. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover
Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to the Appointment Time, in response to a _bona fide_ written Takeover
Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines
(after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) is or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal was not solicited after the
date hereof and was made after the date hereof and did not otherwise
result from a breach of this Section 4.02(a), the Company may, subject to
compliance with Section 4.02(c), (x) furnish information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Takeover Proposal (and
its Representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (which (A) need
not restrict such person from making an unsolicited Takeover Proposal and (B)
shall permit the Company to comply with the terms of Section 4.02(c))
containing confidentiality and other provisions substantially similar to the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement and not less restrictive to

   such person than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are to
Parent; _provided_ that all such information has previously been provided to
Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the
time it is provided to such person and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal, if and only to the extent
that in connection with the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), the Board of
Directors of the Company concludes in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel) that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 

  The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer
from any person relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to,
any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series
of transactions, of assets (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of
the Company) or businesses that constitute 15% or more of the revenues, net
income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15%
or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially
owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, or any
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any person
or the stockholders of any person would own 15% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or of any resulting parent company of the Company,
in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

  The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide offer made by a
third party that if consummated would result in such person (or its
stockholders) owning, directly or indirectly, more than 60% of the shares of
Company Common Stock then outstanding (or of the shares of the surviving
entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in
a merger) or more than 60% of the assets of the Company, which the Board of
Directors of the Company reasonably determines (after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be (i) more
favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view
than the Offer and the Merger (taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the
financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such
offer or otherwise)), (ii) not subject to any due diligence condition and
(iii) reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, taking into
account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

 

  (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to
Parent the Company Recommendation, (B) take any other action or make any
public statement in connection with the Company Recommendation, the Offer, the
Merger or the Company Stockholders' Meeting that is inconsistent with the
Company Recommendation or (C) adopt or recommend, or propose publicly to
adopt or recommend, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause
(i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or
(ii) adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt or recommend, or allow
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar Contract constituting or related to, or

   that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
4.02(a)) (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time prior to the Appointment Time and subject to Section 4.02(c), the
Board of Directors of the Company may (1) in response to a situation other
than as described in clause (2) below, make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change if the Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of
Directors to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law or (2) in response to a Takeover Proposal that the Board
reasonably determines (after consultation with outside counsel and
a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes a
Superior Proposal and that was unsolicited and made after the date hereof and
that did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 4.02, (A) make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors of the
Company has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board of
Directors to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law or (B) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.01(f) and concurrently with or after such termination enter into
an Acquisition Agreement if the Board of Directors of the Company has
concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board of
Directors to terminate this Agreement would be reasonably likely to result in
a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however,_
that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing
clause (B), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (B)
shall be void and of no force or effect, unless concurrently with
such termination the Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee and the
Expenses payable pursuant to Section 5.06(b); _provided, further, however_ ,
that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.01(f) unless the Company has: (A) provided to Parent five Business
Days' prior written notice (such notice, a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ")
advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to take
such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms
and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed
action by the Board of Directors (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new five
Business Day period), (B) during such five Business Day period, if requested
by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this
Agreement in such a manner that the Takeover Proposal which was determined to
constitute a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal and (C) at the
end of such five Business Day period, such Takeover Proposal has not been
withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking
into account any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent in response to a Notice of Superior Proposal, as a result of the
negotiations required by clause (C) or otherwise).

 

  (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours of learning of the relevant information) advise
Parent orally and in writing of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of any such Takeover Proposal (including any changes thereto) and
the identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal. The 

  Company shall keep Parent fully informed in all material respects of the
status and details (including any change to the material terms thereof) of any
Takeover Proposal.

 

 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company from at any time taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a statement required under Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or other applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 4.02(b) .

If any of the information or material furnished pursuant to this Section 5.02 includes materials or information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, each party understands and agrees that the parties have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of the parties that the sharing of such material or information is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or information or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such information provided by the Company that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.

in confidence in accordance with, and shall otherwise abide by and be subject
to, the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement dated April 19,

survive any termination of this Agreement. No investigation pursuant to this
Section 5.02 or information provided or received by any party hereto pursuant
to this Agreement will affect any of the representations or warranties of the
parties hereto contained in this Agreement.

 

  SECTION 5.03. _Further Action; Efforts_.(a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the

applicable Antitrust Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in
all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and
in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) keep the other party reasonably
informed of the status of matters related to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including furnishing the other with any written notices or
other communications received by such party from, or given by such party to,
the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the

Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the

or such other applicable Governmental Entity or other person, give the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences in accordance with Antitrust Law.

  (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in Sections 5.03(a) and (b), each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with any filing or submission required or action to be taken by either Parent or the Company to consummate the Offer and the Merger, in no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates be obligated to propose or agree to accept any undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any divestiture or accept any operational restriction, or take or commit to take any action (i) the effectiveness or consummation of which is not conditional on the consummation of the Offer and the Merger or (ii) that individually or in the aggregate is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse (with materiality, for purposes of this provision, being measured in relation to the size of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole) to (A) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, either before or after giving effect to the Offer or the Merger or (B) Parents ownership or operation of any portion of the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries business or assets (a " _Materially Burdensome Condition_ ").

 

 (d) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any person (other than a Governmental Entity) with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall take any action, agree to take any action or consent to the taking of any action pursuant to this Section 5.03 (including with respect to selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing of assets or conducting its business in a specified manner).

 

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.03 shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(ii), so long as such party has up to then complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 5.03.

 

 SECTION 5.04. _Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Units, Company_ _Director Stock Units and ESPP_.

 

 (a) The parties agree as follows:

 

(i) Subject to Section 5.04(b), each Company Stock Option, to the extent
outstanding and unvested at the Appointment Time, shall vest in full as of the

  Appointment Time, and each Company Stock Option that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted at
the Effective Time into a vested option (a " _Parent Option_ ") to purchase
that number of common shares, without par value, of Parent (" _Parent Common
Shares_ "), equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
the Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
the ratio of the Merger Consideration over the average closing price of Parent
common stock on the last five trading days immediately prior to the Effective
Time (such ratio, the " _Conversion Ratio_ ") (and rounded down to the nearest
whole share), with an exercise price per share equal to the exercise price per
share that existed under the corresponding Company Stock Option divided by the
Conversion Ratio (and rounded up to the nearest whole cent), and with other
terms and conditions that are the same as the terms and conditions of the
applicable Company Stock Option immediately before the Effective Time;
_provided_ that the foregoing conversion shall be carried out in a manner to
ensure that the Company Stock Option or Parent Option does not become subject
to Section 409(A) of the Code and with respect to any Company Stock Option
that is an "incentive stock option" (within the meaning of Section 422 of the
Code), the foregoing conversion shall be carried out in a manner satisfying
the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Parent agrees that it will
maintain the effectiveness of the Companys registration statement on Form S-8
until the Effective Time and Parent shall not deregister any shares of Company
Common Stock previously registered on such Form S-8 until the Effective Time.
Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to file, within 10 days after
the Closing Date, a registration statement on Form S-8 or other appropriate
form under the Securities Act to register the issuance of Parent Common Shares
upon exercise of the Parent Options and to use its reasonable efforts to cause
such registration statement to remain effective until the exercise or
expiration of the Parent Options.

 

 (ii) Each Company Restricted Stock Unit and each Company Director Stock Unit that is outstanding immediately prior to the Appointment Time shall be canceled by the Company and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive within three Business Days following the Effective Time from the Surviving Corporation, in consideration for such cancellation, an amount (less applicable withholdings, if any, and without interest) equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit or Company Director Stock Unit, as applicable.

 

 (iii) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plan) and Parent shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the foregoing actions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 5.04(a) and shall make such other changes to the Company Stock Plan as Parent and the Company may agree are appropriate to give effect to the Merger.

 

 (b) The provisions of Section 5.04(a) shall not apply to the Company ESPP. The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all actions necessary to terminate the Company ESPP effective as of the Effective Time and all outstanding rights thereunder at the 

  Effective Time, and ensure that no new offering periods thereunder commence
during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time.
The offering period currently in effect as of the date of this Agreement shall
end in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP; _provided_ that there
will be no increase in the amount of payroll deductions permitted to be made
by the participants therein during such period; and _provided further_ that,
on the last day of the current offering period, each participant in the
Company ESPP will be credited with the number of share(s) of Common Stock
purchased for his or her account(s) under the Company ESPP in respect of the
applicable offering period in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP,
unless the Effective Time occurs prior to the end of the offering period
currently in effect, in which case all then-outstanding rights to purchase
stock under the Company ESPP shall be accelerated and exercised no later than
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 (c) The Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Stock Option (or former holder of a Company Stock Option) or any participant in any Company Stock Plan, Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any other equity interest therein (including "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights).

 

SECTION 5.05. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

 (a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume the obligations with respect to all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities, including advancement of expenses, for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws, the organization documents of any Subsidiary or any written indemnification Contract between such directors or officers and the Company (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof), without further action, as of the Effective Time and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 

 (b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and other assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.05. In addition, in the event (A) the Surviving Corporation transfers any material portion of its assets, in a single transaction or in a series of transactions or (B) Parent takes any action to materially impair the financial ability of the Surviving Corporation to satisfy the obligations referred to in Section 5.05(a), Parent will either guarantee such obligations or take such other action to insure that the ability of the Surviving Corporation, legal and financial, to satisfy such obligations will not be diminished in any material respect.

 

 (c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain (directly or indirectly through the Companys existing insurance programs) in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person currently covered by the Companys directors and 

  officers liability insurance policy (a complete and accurate copy of which
has been heretofore delivered to Parent), on terms with respect to such
coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on
the date hereof; _provided, however_ , that Parent may (i) substitute therefor
policies of Parent containing terms with respect to coverage (including as
coverage relates to deductibles and exclusions) and amounts no less favorable
to such directors and officers or (ii) request that the Company obtain such
extended reporting period coverage under its existing insurance programs (to
be effective as of the Effective Time); _provided, further,_ that in
satisfying its obligation under this Section 5.05(c), neither the Company nor
Parent shall be obligated to pay more than 250% of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company for such insurance (which annual premiums are
set forth in Section 5.05(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule); _provided_ ,
_further_ that, it is understood and agreed that in the event such coverage
cannot be obtained for such amount or less in the aggregate, Parent shall only
be obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such aggregate
amount.

 

 (d) The provisions of this Section 5.05 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or otherwise.

 

      | SECTION 5.06. _Fees and Expenses_. 
---|--- 

 

 (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section 5.06, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated, except that the filings fees and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation by the financial printer, filing, printing and mailing of the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company.

 

 (b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(e)(i) or Section 7.01(e)(ii), (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f) or (iii)(A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made to the Company or shall have been made directly to the stockholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated (I) by Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) or (II) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iii) and (C) within 12 months after such termination, the Company enters into a definitive Contract to consummate, or consummates, the transactions contemplated by any Takeover Proposal (regardless of whether such Takeover Proposal is made before or after termination of this Agreement), then the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $45,650,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") plus Expenses of up to $7,500,000, by wire transfer of same-day funds on the first Business Day following (x) in the case of a payment required by clause (i) or (ii) above, the date of termination of this Agreement and (y) in the case of a payment required by clause (iii) above, the date of the first to occur of the events referred to in clause (iii)(C) above. " _Expenses_ " shall mean the cash amount necessary to reimburse Parent, Merger Sub and each of their respective Affiliates for all out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred (whether or not billed) at any time (whether before or after the date of this Agreement) prior to the termination of this 

  Agreement by any of them or on their behalf in connection with the Offer, the
Merger, this Agreement, their due diligence investigation of the Company and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the fees and
expenses of counsel, investment banking firms or financial advisors and their
respective counsel and representatives).

 

 (c) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in Section 5.06(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to Section 5.06(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee and/or Expenses, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee and/or Expenses, as the case may be, from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A., in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

 

 SECTION 5.07. _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form previously agreed to by the parties.

 

 SECTION 5.08. _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent.

---|--- 

 

 (a) For a period of twelve months following the Effective Time, the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who remain in the employment of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than any employees covered by collective bargaining agreements) (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") shall receive employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are substantially similar to those received by similarly situated employees of Parent; _provided_ that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation nor any of their Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to issue, or adopt any plans or arrangements providing for the issuance of, shares of capital stock, warrants, options, stock appreciation rights or other rights in respect of any shares of capital stock of any entity or any securities convertible or exchangeable into such shares pursuant to any such plans or arrangements; _provided, further_ , that no plans or arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing for such issuance shall be taken into account in determining whether employee benefits are substantially similar in the aggregate.

    (b) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the
Company shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent
or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee benefit plans
or to continue the employment of any specific person.

 

  (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize the
service of each Continuing Employee as if such service had been performed with
Parent with respect to any plans or programs in which Continuing Employees
are eligible to participate after the Effective Date (i) for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting (but not benefit accrual) under any
defined benefit pension plan, (ii) for purposes of eligibility for
vacation, (iii) for purposes of eligibility and participation under any
health or welfare plan (other than any post-employment health or post-
employment welfare plan), (iv) for purposes of eligibility for any company
matching contributions and (v) unless covered under another arrangement with
or of the Company, for the purpose of determining the amount of any severance
payable under any severance plan of general application, except, in each case,
to the extent such treatment would result in duplicative benefits.

 

  (d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent in which
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the
extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to
such employees under the welfare plans maintained by the Company prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any
analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable
under any such plan, to the extent credited under the welfare plans maintained
by the Company prior to the Effective Time.

 

  (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 5.09, the
provisions of Section 5.09 (a), (c) and (d) shall apply only with respect to
Continuing Employees who are covered under Company Benefit Plans that are
maintained primarily for the benefit of employees employed in the United
States (including Continuing Employees regularly employed outside the United
States to the extent they participate in such Company Benefit Plans).
With respect to Continuing Employees not described in the preceding sentence,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to, comply with all applicable laws, directives and regulations relating to
employees and employee benefits matters applicable to such employees.

 

  (f) Effective as of the day (the " _401(k) Termination Date_ ")
immediately preceding the date that the Company and Parent shall become
members of the same controlled group (within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(14) of ERISA), the Company shall terminate the VIASYS Healthcare Inc.
Retirement and Savings Plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") and the Company
shall contribute to the Company 401(k) Plan as soon as practicable following
the 401(k) Termination Date all contributions required to be made for periods
prior to the 401(k) Termination Date on behalf of participants in the Company
401(k) Plan. The account balances of such participants shall be fully vested
as of the 401(k) Termination Date and the Company shall take any actions
necessary to ensure that such account balances are distributable from the
Company 401(k) Plan on and after the 401(k) Termination Date. Subject to
Parent being

  reasonably satisfied, consistent with the regulations under Section 401(a)(31)
of the Code, that the Company 401(k) Plan meets the requirements for
qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code and the requirements of the
Parent 401(k) Plan (as defined below), Parent shall permit participants who
have an account balance under the Company 401(k) Plan to roll over the
applicable participants "eligible rollover distribution" (as defined under
Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) in the form of cash from the Company 401(k)
Plan to a qualified defined contribution plan maintained by Parent or one of
its Affiliates.

 

 (g) The provisions of this Section 5.09 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i) constitute an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits plans maintained for or provided to Continuing Employees prior to or following the Effective Time or (ii) confer upon or give to any person (including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former employees, directors, or independent contractors of any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 5.09) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

 

 SECTION 5.10. _Takeover Laws_. The Company and its Board of Directors shall (a) use reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) if any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 SECTION 5.11. _Company Rights Agreement_. The Board of Directors of the Company shall take all further actions (in addition to those referred to in Section 3.01(x)) requested by Parent in order to render the Company Rights inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as provided above with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, amend, take any action with respect to, or make any determination under, the Rights Agreement (including a redemption of the Company Rights) to facilitate a Takeover Proposal.
