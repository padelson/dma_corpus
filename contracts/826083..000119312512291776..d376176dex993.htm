ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

Section 1.2  _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time), on a date to be specified by
Parent and the Company (the " _Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later
than the third business day after satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at
such time), at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 4
Times Square, New York, New York 10036, unless another date, time, or place is
agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company.

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger, executed
in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall
become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such later
time as is agreed to by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of
Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to
as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



2 Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company
and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_. At the Effective Time, (i) the certificate of incorporation of
the Company shall be amended and restated to conform to _Exhibit B_ ; and
(ii) the bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated to conform to
_Exhibit C_ , as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors
are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; COMPANY STOCK
OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.3_, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") or any
shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Treatment of
Stock Held by Company Subsidiaries_. All shares of Company Common Stock that
are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of Company Common
Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor. Any shares of Company Common Stock owned by any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company shall not represent the right
to receive the Merger Consideration and shall, at the election of Parent,
either (i) convert into shares of a class

 



3  of stock of the Surviving Corporation designated by Parent in connection
with the Merger or (ii) be cancelled.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
_Section 2.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to $28.00 without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate, which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common
Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ "), or non-certificated shares of Company
Common Stock represented by book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_, without interest.

 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") to receive, on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company,
for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the aggregate
Merger Consideration to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall
become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_. Parent shall deposit or cause
to be deposited such aggregate Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent at
or prior to the Effective Time. Such aggregate Merger Consideration deposited
with the Paying Agent shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent in (i) short-term
direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-term
obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii)
short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Services, (iv)
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion or (v) money market funds
having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized
credit rating agency at the time of such investment. No such investment, and
no losses thereon, shall affect the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to
former holders of Company Common Stock. Parent shall promptly replace or cause
to be replaced any funds deposited with the Paying Agent lost through any
investment made pursuant to this  _Section 2.2(a)_.

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than three business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common
Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in
such form and shall have such other customary provisions as Parent and the
Company may reasonably agree to prior to the Effective Time) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss thereof) or Book-Entry Share
for cancellation to the Paying Agent,

 



4  together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a check in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (y) the
Merger Consideration, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that (x) the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y)
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share surrendered and shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section 2.2_, each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
as contemplated by this _Article II_ , without interest. 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and at the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that evidenced
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. Subject to  _Section 2.2(e)_, if, at any time after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
II_.

 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article II_.

(e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,

 



5  and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement,
without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders
at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts any of them
reasonably determines are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_
"), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder
who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such share of
Company Common Stock pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ")
shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead shall be
entitled to receive the fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock as
may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right,
such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if
they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive,
as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such share of
Company Common Stock, in accordance with _Section 2.1_, without any interest
thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal
and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands for appraisal. 

 



6  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Effective
Time the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Section 2.4 _Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units_.

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to:

(i) cancel, as of the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock granted under any Company Stock Plan (each, an "
_Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised (without regard to the
exercise price of such Option and whether vested or unvested) as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, without the creation
of additional liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), subject,
if applicable, to payment pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_; and

(ii) cancel, as of the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit to acquire
or receive shares of Company Common Stock granted under any Company Stock Plan
(each, a " _Restricted Stock Unit_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) (in each case,
without the creation of additional liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), subject, as applicable, to payment pursuant to _Section
2.4(e)_.

(b) Each Vested Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and has an exercise price per share that is less
than the per share Merger Consideration shall be converted into the right to
receive as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any
event no later than five business days after the Effective Time) a cash
amount equal to the Designated Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock then subject to the Vested Option (subject to applicable Tax withholding
and without interest). Each Vested Option, when so converted, shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist and the holder of such Vested Option shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Designated
Consideration. In the event that the exercise price per share of any Vested
Option or Unvested Option is equal to or greater than the per share Merger
Consideration, such Vested Option or Unvested Option shall be cancelled
without payment therefor and have no further force or effect. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Designated Consideration_ " means, with respect to any
share of Company Common Stock issuable under a particular Option, an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration over (ii) the
exercise price payable per share of Company Common Stock issuable under such
Option.

(c) Each Unvested Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and has an exercise price per share that is less
than the per share Merger Consideration shall be assumed by Parent and shall
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions, including
vesting, applicable to each such Unvested Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Each assumed Unvested Option shall be exercisable (or will
become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole
shares of Parent common stock, par value $0.01 (" _Parent Common Stock_ "),
equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share of Parent
Common Stock) of (i) the number of shares of Company Common

 



7  Stock that would have been issuable upon exercise of such Unvested Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Option Exchange Ratio.
The per share exercise price of each such Unvested Option shall equal the
quotient (which shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by
dividing (x) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock applicable
to such Unvested Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the
Option Exchange Ratio. It is the intention of the parties that the assumption
of the Unvested Options shall be effected in a manner that satisfies the
requirements of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder.

(d) Each Unvested Restricted Stock Unit that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive, on the same terms and conditions (except as specifically provided in
this Agreement) as were applicable to such Unvested Restricted Stock Unit, on
each date (each a " _RSU Vesting Event_ ") in which shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Unvested Restricted Stock Unit would have become vested
and exercisable, and provided that the holder of such Unvested Restricted
Stock Unit is still employed by the Company or the Parent on such date a cash
amount equal to the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock then subject to the Unvested Restricted Stock Unit that would have
otherwise vested on such RSU Vesting Event (subject to applicable Tax
withholding and without interest). Each Unvested Restricted Stock Unit, when
so converted, shall no longer represent the right to acquire Company Common
Stock and shall represent the right to receive the cash consideration as set
forth in this _Section 2.4(d)_. Except as otherwise provided in a Company
Stock Plan or an individual grant agreement related to the Unvested Restricted
Stock Units, no acceleration of the vesting of the Unvested Restricted
Stock Units shall take place as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

(e) Each Vested Restricted Stock Unit that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Vested Restricted
Stock Unit and subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code, a cash
amount equal to the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock then subject to the Vested Restricted Stock Unit (subject to applicable
Tax withholding and without interest). Each Vested Restricted Stock Unit,
when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and the holder of such Vested
Restricted Stock Unit shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

Section 2.5 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article II_
to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence
or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

(b) Each Company Plan complies in form and has been, in all material respects,
established, maintained, administered, and funded in compliance with its
terms and applicable Laws, including ERISA, the Code and similar non-U.S.
laws, as applicable. Each Company Plan intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination
letter from the IRS or is entitled to rely upon a favorable opinion issued by
the IRS, and to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no existing
circumstances or any events that have occurred that could reasonably be
expected to affect adversely the qualified status of any such Company Plan.
All contributions to the Company Plans that were required to be made by the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company under such Company Plans have been
made, and all benefits accrued under any unfunded Company Plan have been
paid, accrued or otherwise adequately reserved to the extent required by, and
in accordance with, GAAP, and with respect to each Company Plan that is funded
wholly or partially through an insurance policy, all premiums required to
have been paid under the insurance policy have been paid. Neither the Company
nor its Subsidiaries is or reasonably could be subject to either a material
liability pursuant to Section 502 of ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant to

had any liability with respect to a plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Code
Section 412, including any "single employer" defined benefit plan or any
"multiemployer plan" each as defined in Section 4001 of ERISA.

(d) Except as required under Section 601 _et seq._ of ERISA, no Company Plan
provides benefits or coverage in the nature of health, life or disability
insurance following retirement or other termination of employment.

(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,

director, officer or independent contractor of the Company or any of its

reimburse any current or former service provider to the Company for any tax
incurred by such service provider pursuant to Sections 409A or 4999 of the
Code.

(g) With respect to each Foreign Company Plan, the fair market value of the
assets of each funded Foreign Company Plan, the liability of each insurer for
any Foreign Company Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve
established for any Foreign Company Plan, together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit
obligations, as of the date of this Agreement, with respect to all current and
former participants in such Foreign Company Plan according to the
actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to such Foreign Company Plan and no transaction contemplated by
this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to 

 



19  be less than such benefit obligations. Each Company Plan which, under the
Laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States, is required to be
registered or approved by any Governmental Authority, has been so registered
and approved and, to the Knowledge of the Company, has been maintained in good
standing with applicable requirements of the Governmental Authorities, and if
intended to qualify for special tax treatment, to the Knowledge of the

could reasonably be expected to affect adversely the special tax treatment

(b) The Company shall and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and their
respective officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents, advisors,
Affiliates and other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ")
(i) to immediately cease any solicitation, encouragement, discussions or
negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover
Proposal and request that any such Person promptly return or destroy all
confidential information concerning the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries
and (ii) until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_ , not to, directly or indirectly,
(A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way
of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries regarding, or the making
of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, a Takeover Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
other Person information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging
or facilitating, a Takeover Proposal or (C) enter into any letter of intent,

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.2(b)_,
if at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company or any of its Representatives receives a written Takeover Proposal
from any Person or group of Persons, which Takeover Proposal did not result
from any material breach of this _Section 5.2_, (A) the Company and its
Representatives may contact such Person or group of Persons to clarify the
terms and conditions thereof and (B) if the Company Board, or any committee
thereof, determines in good faith, after consultation with independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives may (x) furnish, pursuant
to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public
information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person
or group of Persons who has made such Takeover Proposal; _provided_ that the
Company shall promptly provide to Parent any material non-public 

 



37  information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided to any Person given such access which was not previously provided to
Parent or its Representatives; and (y) engage in or otherwise participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such
Takeover Proposal. Prior to taking any of the actions referred to in this
_Section 5.2(c)_, the Company shall notify Parent and Merger Sub that it
proposes to furnish non-public information and/or enter into discussions or
negotiations as provided in this _Section 5.2(c)_.

(d) The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of any material
developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any Takeover Proposal on a
current basis and upon the request of Parent shall apprise Parent of the
status of such Takeover Proposal. The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing
any information to Parent in accordance with this _Section 5.2_. If the
Company Board receives a Takeover Proposal, then the Company shall promptly
provide to Parent a redacted copy of such Takeover Proposal, which redacted
copy shall include disclosure of the identity of the Person that submitted
such Takeover Proposal, as well as the proposed price and material conditions.

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.2(e)_ or _Section
5.2(f)_, the Company Board shall not (i) (A) fail to recommend to its
stockholders that the Company Stockholder Approval be given (the " _Company
Board Recommendation_ ") or fail to include the Company Board Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or
publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or in a manner
adverse to Parent modify, the Company Board Recommendation, (C) take any
formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection
with a tender offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation against
such offer or a temporary "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company
Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act or (D) adopt, approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to the stockholders of
the Company a Takeover Proposal (actions described in this clause (i) being
referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (ii) authorize,
cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, agreement or agreement in principle with respect to any
Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (each,
a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "), (iii) take any action pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)(ii)_, or (iv) terminate, amend, release, modify or fail to
enforce any provision of, or grant any permission, waiver or request under,
any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement entered into by the
Company in respect of or in contemplation of a Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into a Company Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal not solicited in a manner that
constitutes a material violation of this _Section 5.2_, or terminate,
amend, release, modify or fail to enforce any provision of, or grant any
permission, waiver, or request under, any standstill, confidentiality or
similar agreement entered into by the Company in respect of or in
contemplation of a Takeover Proposal, if and only if, prior to taking such
action, the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation
with independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (x) that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that in connection
with the Takeover Proposal of any bidder (w) the Company has given Parent at
least three business days prior written notice of its intention to

 



38  take such action (which notice shall include an unredacted copy of the
Superior Proposal, an unredacted copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements and an unredacted copy of any financing commitments relating
thereto (other than the same type of redactions permitted by Section 4.5 of
the Insight Merger Agreement)), (x) the Company has negotiated, and has caused
its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such
notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to
propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement and the Voting Agreement such
that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal, (y) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall
have considered in good faith any proposed revisions to this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have
determined that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior
Proposal if such revisions were to be given effect and (z) in the event of any
material change to the material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company
shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent
with that described in clause (w) above and the notice period shall have
recommenced, except that the notice period shall be at least two business
days; and _provided_ ,  _further_ that the Company has complied in all
material respects with its obligations under this _Section 5.2_ and provided,
further, that any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
sentence shall be void and of no force and effect, unless the Company
termination is in accordance with _Section 7.1_ and the Company pays Parent
the applicable Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 7.3_ prior to or
concurrently with such termination. 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Company Board
may change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to
change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or, in a manner adverse to Parent, modify,
the Company Board Recommendation (" _Change of Recommendation_ ") if the
Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, prior to taking such action, (x) the Company Board has given Parent at
least three business days prior written notice of its intention to take such
action, (y) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the extent
Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to revise the terms of this
Agreement and the Voting Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the
need for taking such action, and (z) following the end of such notice period,
the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any revisions to this
Agreement and the Voting Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to effect a Change
of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. 

(g) Except to the extent provided in _Section 5.2(d)_ or _Section 5.2(e)_,
nothing in this  _Section 5.2_ shall prohibit the Company Board from: (i)
taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, if failure to do so would violate
applicable Law or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the
Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, in either case, if the Company Board has determined in good
faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that the failure to do so would
create a material risk of a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary 

 



39  duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that any disclosures (other than
those made pursuant to clause (ii) of this _Section 5.2(g)_) permitted under
this  _Section 5.2(g)_ that is not an express rejection of any applicable
Takeover Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation shall be deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry,
proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) or
"group," within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, relating to,
in a single transaction or series of related transactions, any (A) acquisition
of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries equal to 20% or more of the
Companys consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of the Companys
revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (B) acquisition
of 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock, (C) tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially
owning 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock, (D) merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or (E)
any combination of the foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the
percentage of consolidated assets, consolidated revenues or earnings
and Company Common Stock involved is 20% or more; in each case, other than
the Transactions.

(i) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any written
Takeover Proposal that the Company Board has determined, after consulting with
the Companys outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors, in its
good faith judgment is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with
its terms, taking into account all legal, regulatory and financial aspects
(including certainty of closing) of the proposal and the Person making the
proposal, and if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to
the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the
Transactions (including any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent in response to such proposal or otherwise);  _provided_ that for
purposes of the definition of " _Superior Proposal_ ", the references to "20%"
in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
"50%."

requirements of _Section 5.3(b)_, a meeting of its stockholders (including
any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_
") for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to
_Section 5.2_, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies giving the Company Stockholder Approval
and shall take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure
the vote or consent of the stockholders of the Company required by
the Company Charter Documents, the rules of The Nasdaq Global Select Market
or the DGCL. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders
Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure
that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided
to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in
advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting or (ii) if as of the time for
which the Company Stockholders

 



40  Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there
are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person

calendar days after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall amend
the Proxy Statement and file it with the SEC and the Company and Parent shall
cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation of
the foregoing. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC or its staff
concerning the Proxy Statement and shall cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to its stockholders at the earliest practicable time after the
resolution of any such comments. The Company shall notify Parent promptly upon
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government
officials and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government

Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent
and Merger Sub will furnish to the Company in writing the information relating
to it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. Parent shall ensure that
such information supplied by it in writing for inclusion (or incorporation by
reference) in the Proxy Statement will not, on the date it is first mailed to
stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting or filed with the SEC (as applicable), contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or mailing the
Proxy Statement or filing any other required filings (or, in each case, any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with an opportunity to
review and comment on such document or respond and shall include in such
document or response comments reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company shall
ensure that the Proxy Statement (i) will not, on the date it is first mailed
to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading and (ii) will comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to
information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.

 

Section 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to
promptly (i) unless, with respect to any action, another standard of
performance is expressly provided for herein, take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper
or advisable to cause the other partys (with respect to Parent and Merger
Sub) or parties (with respect to the Company) conditions to

 



41  Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions,
including preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect
all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications, title affidavits (including non-
imputation affidavits) and other documents and (ii) obtain all approvals,
consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from
any Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to

registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents,
approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations relating to Antitrust Laws, which are dealt with in _Section
5.4(c)_ below). For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman
Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, all applicable foreign antitrust Laws and all
other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and use its, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use
their respective, reasonable best efforts to obtain executed payoff
letters, lien terminations and instruments of discharge for the Indebtedness

such Indebtedness prior to or simultaneously with the Closing, subject to the
payment of such amounts to the lenders in accordance with the provisions of
such payoff letters.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and
Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (x) take all action
necessary to ensure that the restrictions of any state takeover statute or
similar Law are not, and do not become, applicable to any of the Transactions
and (y) if the restrictions of any state takeover statute or similar Law
become applicable to any of the Transactions, take all action necessary to
ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise lawfully minimize the
effect of such Law on the Transactions.

 

(c) Each party hereto agrees to make any required filings of Notification and
Report Forms pursuant to the HSR Act and to make any other required filings
or submissions with foreign antitrust or competition authorities with respect
to the Transactions as promptly as practicable (and with respect to
Notification and Report Forms pursuant to the HSR Act within fifteen (15)
business days of the date hereof) and to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law. Further, Parent agrees to
promptly take any and all steps, and to cause each Subsidiary and controlled
Affiliate of Parent to promptly take any and all steps, necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment, including avoiding the commencement of
any action to prohibit the Transactions, and obtain all consents under any
Antitrust Laws that may be required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or
local Governmental Authority, in each case with competent jurisdiction,
including agreeing to sell, license, hold separate or otherwise dispose of
any of their assets or business owned as of the date hereof, in whole or in
part, or to conduct or limit any aspect of any of their assets or business in
any specified manner, provided that the impacted assets and
business generated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 not in
excess of $200 million in the aggregate, so as to enable the

 



42  parties to close the Transactions no later than the Outside Date; _provided_
, _however_ , nothing in this _Section 5.4_ shall permit the Company to agree
to sell, license, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets or
business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, in whole or in part, or to conduct or
limit any aspect of their respective assets or business in any specified
manner, or to permit the foregoing actions without the prior written consent
of Parent; _provided_ , _further_ , nothing in this _Section 5.4_ shall
obligate Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
agree to sell, license, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets or
business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, in whole or in part, or to conduct or
limit any aspect of their respective assets or business in any specified
manner, or to permit the foregoing actions, in each case the effectiveness or
consummation of which is not conditioned on the consummation of the Merger.

 

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any
proceeding initiated by a private Person, and (ii) keep the other party
informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any
material communication received by such party from, or given by such party to,
the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice or any other Governmental Authority and of any material communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding any of the Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, each of the parties hereto shall have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will
consult the other on, all the information relating to the other parties
and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third Person and/or
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, other than
"4(c) and 4(d) documents" as those terms are used in the rules and
regulations under the HSR Act.

Section 5.5 _Required Notice/Consultation_. The Company shall provide any
notice to or undertake any consultation with any employee representative
required under any collective bargaining agreement or other agreement with a
labor union, works council or like organization or applicable Law prior to
the Closing.

Section 5.6 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Except with respect to any
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant thereto,
and made in accordance with _Section 5.2_ and _Article VII_ , so long as
this Agreement is in effect, neither the Company nor Parent shall issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement (to
the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement)
with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions without
the prior consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except as may be required by Law, applicable fiduciary
duties or by any applicable listing agreement with a national securities
exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the party proposing to
make such release or other 

 



43  public announcement (in which case such party shall not issue or cause the
publication of such press release or other public announcement without prior
consultation with the other party). 

Section 5.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall afford to
Parent and Parents Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours to the Companys officers, employees, agents, properties, books,
Contracts and records and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent such
information concerning its business, personnel, assets, liabilities and
properties as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ that Parent and its
representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company;
_provided_ , _further_ _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to
provide such access or information if the Company determines, in
its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or a
Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third-party, waive the
protection of an attorney-client privilege, or expose the Company to risk of
liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information. Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Company does not provide access
or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall provide notice
to Parent that it is withholding such access or information and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable
information in a way that would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or
obligation or risk waiver of such privilege. Without limiting the generality
of this _Section 5.7_, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time, the Company will furnish to the Parent promptly after becoming
available, (i) monthly financial statements, including an unaudited
balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flows for each month
through the Closing Date, as it may prepare for managements internal use, and
(ii) any update of its outlook for the quarter or the balance of the fiscal
year, as it may prepare for managements internal use. Until the Effective
Time, the information provided will be subject to the terms of the letter
agreement, dated as of April 5, 2012, between the Company and Parent (as it
may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

Section 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of
such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent and (ii) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions or any assets of
the Company or any Subsidiary that are material to the ongoing operations of
the Company or such Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business.

 

Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the
date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the
Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director
or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company

 



44  (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with
respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any
claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out
of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was a director or
officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an
Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company
or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee
or fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each
case under (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time
(including any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation relating in
whole or in part to the Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company and such
Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification (and advancement
of expenses) and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, as provided in the Company Charter Documents and the
organizational documents of such Subsidiaries as currently in effect, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to maintain
such rights to indemnification (and advancement of expenses) and exculpation
provided in the Company Charter Documents and the organizational documents of
such Subsidiaries as currently in effect. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent, from and after the Effective Time until six years from the Effective
Time, shall cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no
less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of
directors and officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date
of this Agreement in the Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not
be amended (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise), repealed or
otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from the Effective Time until six
years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any
Indemnitee under this  _Section 5.9_ (including in connection with enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations referred to in this _Section 5.9_) as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that
the individual to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such advances if it shall be determined that such person is not entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to this _Section 5.9(a)_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this _Section 5.9(a)_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation of a covered person for
which indemnification may be sought under this _Section 5.9(a)_ unless such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional
release of such covered person from all liability arising out of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and does not include an admission
of fault or wrongdoing by any Indemnitee or such Indemnitee
otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise, consent or
termination.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to assume and control the defense of any litigation, claim or proceeding
relating to any acts or omissions

 



45  covered under this _Section 5.9_ (each, a " _Claim_ ") with counsel
selected by the Surviving Corporation, which counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitee;  _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation (i) shall be liable for any settlement effected
without Parents written consent or (ii) shall be liable for the fees and
expenses of more than one counsel in addition to any local counsel. Each of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the
defense of any Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as
reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records,
information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection
therewith.

 

(c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance covering acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those
individuals who are currently (and any additional individuals who prior to
the Effective Time become) covered by the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policy (provided that Parent may substitute therefor
policies, issued by reputable and financially sound insurers, of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
favorable in any material respect) with respect to claims arising from or
related to facts or events which occurred at or prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , however, that Parent shall not be obligated to make aggregate
annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed
300% of the current aggregate annual premium (such 300% threshold, the "
_Maximum Premium_ ");  _provided_ , _further_ , if such insurance coverage
cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an aggregate annual
premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall maintain the most
advantageous policies of directors and officers insurance obtainable for an
aggregate annual premium not to exceed the Maximum Premium; _provided_ ,
_further_ , if the Company in its sole discretion elects, by giving written
notice to Parent at least two (2) business days prior to the Effective Time,
then, in lieu of the foregoing insurance, effective as of the Effective Time,
the Company shall purchase, for an aggregate amount not to exceed six times
the Maximum Premium, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions
providing at least substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies
of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and
its Subsidiaries with respect to wrongful acts and/or omissions committed or
allegedly committed at or prior to the Effective Time, covering without
limitation the transactions contemplated hereby. If such prepaid "tail policy"
has been obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all
obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this _Section 5.9(c)_ and the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in
full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all of their
obligations thereunder.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her
successors, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such individual may have by contract or otherwise.
The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section
5.9_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies (it
being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.9_
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9_).

 



46 (e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this  _Section 5.9_.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.9_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

Section 5.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
such steps as may be required to cause dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by
each individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.11 _Employee Matters_.

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to those employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by the Parent and its
Subsidiaries (individually, " _Company Employee_ " and collectively, "
_Company Employees_ ") (i) annual base salary or base wages and short-term
cash incentive compensation opportunities that are substantially comparable,
respectively, to the annual base salary or base wages and short-term cash
incentive compensation opportunities provided to Company Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) benefits (excluding equity-based
compensation) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to such
benefits (excluding equity-based compensation) provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any Company Employee any right to continued employment for any period or
shall prohibit the Parent or its Subsidiaries from terminating the employment
of any Company Employee. 

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and levels of benefits
(but not benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan) under the employee
benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries in which Company Employees first
become eligible to participate after the Effective Time (including the Company
Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with
his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent shall use its

 



47  commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each Company Employee to be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable
coverage under a Company Plan in which such Company Employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old
Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived
under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which
such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Company Employee and
his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old
Plan ending on the date such Company Employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

(c) The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all action necessary
or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, any Company Plan that contains a cash or deferred
arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code (the "
_401(k) Plans_ "), unless Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, agrees
to sponsor and maintain any such 401(k) Plan by providing the Company with
written notice of such election (an " _Election Notice_ ") at least ten days
before the Closing Date. Unless Parent timely provides an Election Notice to
the Company, the Company shall deliver to Parent prior to the Effective Time,
evidence that the Companys board of directors has validly adopted resolutions
to terminate the 401(k) Plans (the form and substance of such resolutions
shall be subject to review and approval of Parent), effective no later than
the date immediately preceding the Closing Date. Parent shall cause a plan
intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code to accept rollovers from
any 401(k) Plan.

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good
faith to develop appropriate communications to employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries. Prior to making any written or material broad-based oral
communications to the directors, officers or employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries pertaining to the effect upon employment, compensation or
benefit matters that will result as a consequence of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy
of the intended communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time
to review and comment on the communication, and Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable communication.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.11_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this  _Section 5.11_ is
intended to, or shall, constitute (or be construed as) the establishment or
adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA
or otherwise and no Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any current
or former employee or any other individual associated therewith) shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the Agreement or have
the right to enforce the provisions hereof.

 



48 Section 5.12 _Notification of Certain Matters; Stockholder Litigation_. Prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and
the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of any actions, suits, claims
or proceedings commenced or, to the Companys Knowledge on the one hand and
Parents knowledge, on the other hand, threatened against such party which
relate to this Agreement and the Transactions. The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to
this Agreement and the Transactions, and no such settlement (relating to
monetary amounts or relief and/or adverse disclosure) shall be agreed to
without Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

Section 5.13 _SEC Filings_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
file with or furnish to the SEC, on a timely basis, all required registration
statements, certifications, reports and proxy statements with the SEC.

Section 5.14 _Director Resignations_. Prior to the Closing, other than with
respect to any directors identified by Parent in writing to the Company two
days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent
resignations executed by each director of the Company in office immediately
prior to the Effective Time, which resignations shall be effective at the
Effective Time and which resignations shall not have been revoked or be
revoked prior to the Effective Time.

Section 5.15 _Insight Payment_. In the event that the Termination Fee
or Parent Expenses (each as defined in the Insight Merger Agreement) or both
shall become due and payable pursuant to the terms of the Insight Merger
Agreement, Parent agrees that it shall make, or has made, a loan to the
Company documented by a promissory note in the form attached as _Exhibit D_
hereto (together, the " _Parent Loan_ "). The Parent Loan shall be funded by
Parent on or after the date hereof and on or prior to the date on which such
Termination Fee or Parent Expenses or both shall be due and payable by the
Company in accordance with the terms of the Insight Merger Agreement. Upon the
consummation of the Closing under this Agreement, the Parent Loan shall be
forgiven. All amounts owing under the Parent Loan shall be immediately due
and payable by the Company to Parent upon any termination of this Agreement.

by each of their respective Boards of Directors; or

(b) by either of the Company or Parent:

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before December 30,
2012 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ shall not be
available to a party if the failure of the Merger to have been consummated
on or before the Outside Date was primarily due to the failure of such party
to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_
, _however_ , that, if, on the Outside Date, either of the conditions to the
Closing set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ or _Section 6.1(c)_ shall not have
been fulfilled but all other conditions to the Closing either have been
fulfilled or are then capable of being fulfilled, then the Outside Date may be
extended to March 30, 2013 by written notice of either of the Company or
Parent to the other party, and such

 



51  date shall become the Outside Date for purposes of this Agreement, with
further extension of the Outside Date available by mutual written consent of
Parent and the Company;

 

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 6.1(d)_ shall

_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section

(c) by Parent:

(i) if: (A) the Company shall have materially breached or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in

Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 7.1(c)(i)_ if it is then in material breach of any representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder that would result in any
of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.3_ not

earlier, the Outside Date); _provided_ , that Parent must exercise the right
to terminate pursuant to clause (B) of this _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ prior to

terminate prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval;

 



52 (d) by the Company:

 

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have materially breached or failed to

contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section
6.3_ and (B) cannot be cured by Parent or Merger Sub by the Outside Date, or
if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within 30 days following
receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of written notice of such breach or failure to
perform from the Company stating the Companys intention to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ and the basis for such
termination (or, if earlier, the Outside Date); _provided_ , that, the Company
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this 
_Section 7.1(d)(i)_ if it is then in material breach of any representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder that would result in any
of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _6.2_ not being
satisfied; or

void (other than _Sections 7.2_ and _7.3_ , _Article VIII_ , the expense
reimbursement and indemnification provisions of _Section 5.9(b)_, and the
Confidentiality Agreement, all of which shall survive termination of this
Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company or their respective directors, officers and Affiliates, except
the Company may have liability as provided in _Section 7.3_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub from

Termination Fee (as defined below), by wire transfer of same day funds (w) in
the case of _Section 7.3(a)(iii)(A)_, within two business days after such
termination, (x) in the case of _Section 7.3(a)(iii)(B)_, within two business
days following the delivery by Parent of an invoice therefor, (y)
simultaneously with such termination if pursuant to  _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ or

consummation of a Takeover Proposal; it being understood that in no event
shall the Company be required to pay the applicable Termination Fee on more
than one occasion (for the avoidance of doubt other than in the case of the
payment of a Termination Fee payable upon termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)(iii)(B)_, which shall not relieve the Company of
a subsequent obligation to pay a Termination Fee upon consummation of a
Takeover Proposal pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)(i)_). As used herein, "
_Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal to $59,205,761 or, in the

Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and the sole and exclusive remedy
for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub,
any of their respective Affiliates or any other person in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby
(and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such

Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
claim, action or proceeding against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any

partners, stockholders, managers, members or Affiliates arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby
or any matters forming the basis for such termination; _provided_ , _however_
, that nothing in this _Section 7.3(a)_ shall limit the rights of Parent and
Merger Sub under _Section 8.8_.

 

(b) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
7.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that without these
agreements, the Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this _Section 7.3_, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent commences an
Action which results in a judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay
Parent and Merger Sub their reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on such amount

 



54  at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was

Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, by
written agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by their respective
Boards of Directors;  _provided_ , _however_ , that following approval of the

any of such partys conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder

such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 8.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior

Section 8.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,

and thereof and (b) except for: (i) if the Effective Time occurs the right of
the Companys stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration at the

Delaware) and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such action or proceeding and
irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
any such action or proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction and venue set
forth in this _Section 8.7(b)_ shall not constitute general consents to
service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any
purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to
confer rights on any Person other than the parties hereto. The parties hereto
agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any partys rights to seek any
post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court
judgment.

Section 8.8 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this

to issue is 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "
_Common Stock_ "). Each holder of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote

B-1  ARTICLE VII

Section 7.1 The Corporation shall indemnify to the fullest extent permitted
under and in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware any person who
was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of
the Corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the person acted in good
faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the persons conduct
was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not
act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect
to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that the
persons conduct was unlawful.

 

Section 7.2 The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party
or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in
its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against
expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the
person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if
the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and except
that no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or
matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the
Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the
court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon
application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the
circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity by the Corporation for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or
such other court shall deem proper.

Section 7.3 Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit
or proceeding shall (in the case of any action, suit or proceeding against a
director of the Corporation) or may (in the case of any action, suit or
proceeding against an officer, trustee, employee or agent of the Corporation)
be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such
action, suit or proceeding as authorized by the Board of Directors upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of a person so indemnified to repay
such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this _Article
VII_.

 

Section 7.4 The indemnification and other rights set forth in this _Article
VII_ shall not be exclusive of any provisions with respect thereto in the
bylaws of the Corporation or any other

 



B-2   contract or agreement between the Corporation and any officer, director,
employee or agent of the Corporation.

Section 7.5 Neither the amendment nor repeal of this _Article VII_ , nor the
adoption of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent
with this _Article VII_ , shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this
_Article VII_ in respect of any matter occurring before such amendment, repeal
or adoption of an inconsistent provision or in respect of any cause of action,
suit or claim relating to any such matter which would have given rise to a
right of indemnification or right to the reimbursement of expenses pursuant to
this _Article VII_ if such provision had not been so amended or repealed or if
a provision inconsistent therewith had not been so adopted. 

Section 7.6 No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any
stockholder for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not eliminate or limit the
liability of a director:

(a) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders;

(b) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

(c) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware;
or

(d) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
benefit.

If the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is amended after the
date hereof to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the
personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the
Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as so amended.

the time for which a meeting shall have been called, the meeting may adjourn
from time to time, by a majority vote of the stockholders present or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote, without notice other than by
announcement at the meeting until a quorum shall attend. Any meeting at which
a quorum is present may also be adjourned in like manner and for such time or

at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted and any

as originally called.

(10) days before every election of directors, a complete list of the
stockholders entitled to vote, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the

date for the payment of any dividend, or the date for the allotment of rights,
or the date when any change or conversion or exchange of capital stock shall
go into effect, or a date in connection with obtaining the consent of
stockholders for any purposes, as a record date for the determination of the
stockholders entitled to notice of, and to 

 



C-2   vote at, any such meeting, and any adjournment thereof, or entitled to
receive payment of any such dividend, or to any such allotment of rights, or
to exercise the rights in respect of any such change, conversion or exchange

stockholders and only such stockholders as shall be stockholders of record on
the date so fixed shall be entitled to such notice of, and to vote at, such
meeting, and any adjournment thereof, or to receive payment of such dividend,
or to receive such allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, or to give

consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by
the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of
votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at
which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall
be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the
State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of
the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporations registered
office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested. An electronic transmission by a shareholder consenting to an action
to be taken is considered to be written, signed, and dated for the purposes
of this section if the transmission sets forth or is delivered with
information from which the Corporation can determine that the transmission was
transmitted by the shareholder and the date on which the shareholder
transmitted the transmission. The date of transmission is the date on which
the consent was signed. Consent given by electronic transmission may not be
considered delivered until the consent is reproduced in paper form and the
paper form is delivered to the Corporation at its registered office in this
state or its principal place of business, or to an officer or agent of the
Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of shareholder
meetings are recorded. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on delivery,
consent given by electronic transmission may be delivered to the principal
place of business of the Corporation or to an officer or agent of the
Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of shareholder
meetings are recorded to the extent and in the manner provided by resolution
of the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Any photographic, photostatic,
facsimile, or similarly reliable reproduction of a consent in writing signed
by a shareholder may be substituted or used instead of the original writing
for any purpose for which the original writing could be used, if the
reproduction is a complete reproduction of the entire original writing. Prompt
notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than
unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not
consented in writing.

Section 2.10 _Conduct of Meetings_. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, or
if there be none or if the Chairman is absent, the President shall preside at
all regular or special meetings of stockholders. To the maximum extent
permitted by law, such presiding person shall have the power to set procedural
rules, including but not limited to rules respecting the time allotted to
stockholders to speak, governing all aspects of the conduct of such meetings.

removing any director may at the same meeting fill the vacancy caused by such
removal; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the directors fail to fill any
such vacancy, the stockholders may at any special meeting called for that

of Directors shall be required if it is held immediately after the

transacted and any corporate action may be taken at any regular or special

required by statute.

Section 3.10 _Quorum_. A majority of the Board of Directors at any time in
office shall constitute a quorum. At any meeting at which a quorum is present,
the vote of a majority of the members present shall be the act of the Board of
Directors unless the act of a greater number is specifically required by law,
the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws. The members of the Board of
Directors shall act only as the Board of Directors and the individual members
thereof shall not have any powers as such.

receive any stated salary for their services as directors, but by resolution
of the Board of Directors a fixed fee and expenses of attendance may be
allowed for attendance at each meeting. Nothing herein contained shall

an officer, agent or otherwise, and receiving compensation therefor.

Section 3.12 _Action Without a Meeting_. Any action required or permitted to
be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee

Directors or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by
electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic
transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of the proceedings of

the minutes are maintained in electronic form.

 

Section 3.13 _Meetings Through Use of Communications Equipment_. Members of
the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of
Directors, shall, except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, have the power to participate in a meeting of
the Board of Directors, or any committee, by means of a conference telephone

representatives, to give the Corporation a bond, in such sum not exceeding
