    |  | Certain confidential information contained in this document,
marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities
and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended. (b) If the Closing is not completed by June 15, 2004, Seller shall have the
right at any time thereafter (but prior to Closing) to terminate the
Agreement (and all Operative Agreements and attachments thereto, as well as
the Business Sale Agreement), upon prior written notice to the Buyer, for any
reason or no reason; if the Closing is not completed by August 15, 2004,
Buyer shall have the right at any time thereafter (but prior to Closing) to
terminate the Agreement (and all Operative Agreements and attachments thereto,
as well as the Business Sale Agreement), upon written notice to the Seller,
for any reason or no reason; provided however, in both cases, that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 2.1(b) shall not be available
to any Party whose action or failure to act has been a prinicpal cause of or
resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date and
such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of the Agreement.



2.2 _Closing Statement._ Within [*] after Closing, Seller will prepare and
deliver to Buyer a closing statement for the inventory and test equipment
that constitute the Transferred Assets (the "Closing Statement"), as of the
Closing Date. The purpose of the Closing Statement is to correctly reflect any
changes in the Inventory Baseline and the listing of such physical assets
between the Date of Execution and the Closing. For purposes of the Closing
Statement, each unit of finished goods inventory will be assigned the price
ascribed to it in the Custom Sales Agreement and each piece of test
equipment will be assigned its net book value on the books of the Seller as
of the Closing Date. The Closing Statement shall become final and binding upon
the Parties unless Buyer gives written notice of its disagreement of such
items included on or excluded from the Closing Statement within [*] following
Buyers receipt of the Closing Statement. Any such notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted. In the event
that the Closing Statement (as finally resolved) indicates an error in the
Purchase Price, within [*] of such statement becoming final, such error shall
be corrected by either (i) Seller providing a credit to Buyer under the Custom
Sales Agreement in the event that Buyer overpaid at the Closing or (ii) Buyer
tendering a check to Seller in the event that Buyer underpaid at the Closing.

and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended. Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate with respect to Tax matters. 



3.2 _Filing of Returns and Payment of Taxes_. [*] shall prepare and file, or
cause to be prepared and filed, with the appropriate authorities all Tax
returns, reports and forms (herein "Tax Returns") and shall pay, or cause to
be paid, when due all Taxes relating to the Transferred Assets attributable
to any taxable period which ends on or prior to the Closing Date (herein "Pre-
Closing Tax Period"). [*] shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, with the appropriate authorities all Tax Returns, and shall pay, or
cause to be paid, when due all Taxes relating to the Transferred Assets
attributable to taxable periods which are not part of the Pre-Closing Tax
Period. If, in order to properly prepare its Tax Returns for Governmental
Authorities, it is necessary that a party be furnished with additional
information, documents or records relating to the Transferred Assets, both
Seller and Buyer agree to use reasonable efforts to furnish or make available
such then existing, non-privileged information at the recipients request,
cost and expense provided, however, that no party shall be entitled to review
or examine the Tax Returns of any other party.



For purposes of this Section 3.2, in the case of any taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the
Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if the Pre-Closing
Tax Period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date and the
amount of Taxes for taxable periods that are not party of the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be the excess, if any, of (x) the Taxes for the Straddle Period
over (y) the Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period.



3.3 _Refunds and Credits._ Any refunds and credits attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of the [*] and any refunds and
credits attributable to the period that is not part of the Pre-Closing Tax

registration, value-added or real estate transfer taxes, or any similar taxes
and related fees incurred in connection with this Agreement and the other
Operative Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
shall be borne [*]. To the extent legally able to do so, Buyer and Seller
shall cooperate with each other to obtain exemptions from such Taxes, provided
that neither Party shall be obligated to seek any exemption that would require
any governmental audit of its books and records.

of 1934, as amended. Article IV. _Additional Covenants and Agreements_



4.1 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.



(a) Schedule 4.1(a)(1) contains a list of certain employees employed
by Seller as of the date hereof in connection with the Transferred Assets
(the "Regular Employees") Seller will provide an updated list of Regular
Employees as of the Closing in the event that any Regular Employees
employment with Seller is terminated prior to the Closing for any reason.
Buyer shall employ the Employees who accept employment with Buyer, effective
as of the Closing Date.



 

(b) Immediately after the date hereof, Seller shall provide Buyer with such
reasonable access to the Regular Employees for the purpose of Buyer
making offers of employment to such Regular Employees. Buyer may, in its sole
discretion, and Seller shall cooperate in Buyers efforts to, make offers of
employment to any or all of the Regular Employees. Seller agrees that,
concurrent with the Closing, Seller shall terminate the employment with
Seller of all Regular Employees who will be made an offer of employment by
Buyer. As soon as reasonably practicable, Seller shall communicate such intent
to terminate such Regular Employees. Buyer hereby agrees to employ the
Regular Employees who accept employment with Buyer, effective as of the
Closing Date. The Regular Employees who begin their employment with Buyer
shall be employed by Buyer in accordance with the terms and conditions
set forth in subsections 4.1(c), 4.1(d), and 4.1(e) below.



(c) Effective upon the Closing, Buyer agrees that it will employ the Regular
Employees who accept employment with Buyer in the same functional disiplines
and at no less than their then current respective base salaries. All Regular
Employees will be entitled to participate in Buyers employee benefit plans,
commissions, and bonus plans at the same level and manner as similarly-
situated employees of Buyer. Buyer shall make new hire stock option grants
available to all Regular Employees in accordance with Buyers normal grant
guidelines. Prior periods of employment with the Seller (herein "Service
Credit") will be considered as employment with the Buyer for all employment
purposes with the Buyer including the calculation of severance pay, seniority
and benefits eligibility, including vacation. Buyer has summarized its planned
benefit terms to Seller, as reasonably approximated by the document entitled
"United States Terms and Conditions Comparative Analysis" dated April 7,
2004. Buyer shall implement the following severance pay practice for the
Regular Employees: if, within the first [*] after Closing, a Regular Employee
is involuntarily severed without Cause from full time employment with Buyer,
such Regular Employee shall receive the greater [*] of severance pay for each
[*] of service, with a minimum of [*] and a maximum of [*] or Buyers
separation pay. Each week of severance pay will be an amount equal to one
week of such Regular Employees total base cash salary from Buyer for
employment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Regular Employee who is
terminated will be entitled to receive any severance or other payments or
benefits unless such employee executes and delivers to Buyer a full and
complete release of claims in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Buyer. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to in any way
limit or prevent Buyer from terminating any Regular Employee at any time for
Cause or for reasons related to poor performance or conditions of employment
and in the event of any such termination, such Regular Employee shall not be
entitled to any of the severance or employment benefits set forth above. For
the purposes of this paragraph, "Cause" as used herein means termination for
the following reasons: (i) theft, dishonesty or falsification of records of
Buyer or its affiliates; (ii) improper disclosure of Buyer or its Affiliates
confidential

of 1934, as amended. information; (iii) employees failure or inability to perform any reasonably
assigned duties after written notice from Buyer of, and a reasonable
opportunity to cure, such failure or inability; (iv) employees conviction of
any criminal act which impairs his ability to perform his duties as an
employee of Buyer, (v) employees violation of Buyers rules and policies of
employment, (vi) employees repeated failure to follow Buyers reasonable
instructions or directions.



(d) Buyer shall be responsible as of Closing for all liabilities, salaries,
benefits and similar employer obligations for such matters that arise out
of facts or circumstances that soley occur after the Closing Date for all
Regular Employees. Upon separation from Seller, Regular Employees will be paid
by Seller for vacation accrued, plus previously deferred vacation, less
vacation taken.

 



(e) Buyer shall be responsible for liabilities with respect to
the termination of any Regular Employees by Buyer after the Closing,
including without limitation, health care continuation coverage with respect
to plans established or maintained by Buyer after the Closing.



(f) Buyer agrees that, for a period of [*] from the Closing Date, it will
not, without the Sellers written consent, solicit for employment any [*],
_provided, however_ , nothing shall prohibit Buyer from soliciting any of the
Specified Employees or any subcontractor of Seller who is not an employee of
Seller. [*] agrees that, for a period of [*] from the Closing Date, it will
not, without the Buyers written consent, solicit for employment any [*].
Nothwithstanding anything in this subsection (f) above, the term "solicit for
employment" shall not include general employment advertising or the use of any
independent employement agencies or search firm not specifically directed to
employees of the other Party. 



(g) In addition, Buyer and Seller have identified Specified Employees in
Schedule 4.1(a)(3) whom will be made available to Buyer for a personal
interview. Immediately after the date hereof, Seller shall provide Buyer with
access to the Specified Employees for the purpose of Buyer making offers of
employer to such employees. For any Specified Employee willing to undertake
such interview, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 4.1(f), Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to make a
voluntary offer of employment with Buyer to any such Specified Employee. Any
Buyer employment offers to Specified Employees shall occur no later than [*]
after the Closing. Seller is hereby released from any obligations to Buyer
from Seller, for services or other matters under the Operative Agreements,
which were to be performed by any Specified Employee who accepts employment
with Buyer. In the event that a Specified Employee performing services under
the Transition Services Agreement becomes an employee of Buyer, then the
amount that was being paid by Buyer to Seller under the Transition Services
Agreement for such employees services shall be eliminated from all future
amounts due from Buyer to Seller under the Transition Services
Agreement (such amounts being calculated on a pro-rata basis and at the same
rate on a per person basis as is being charged to Buyer in the Transition
Services Agreement for such person).



4.2 _Further Action_. The Parties each agree to execute and deliver after the
Closing Date such other documents, certificates, agreements and other
writings and to take such other actions as may be necessary or desirable, in
the opinion of the Parties counsel, in order to consummate or implement
expeditiously the transactions contemplated hereby.

marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities
and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended. 4.3 _Post-Closing Payments_. The Parties acknowledge that, for a period of
[*] after the Closing Date, Seller may make payments to third parties on
behalf of Buyer associated with the Transferred Assets and Assumed
Liabilities. Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller for such payments [*] receipt of
an invoice from Seller provided [*]. Seller shall invoice Buyer monthly on
the fifth (5th) day of each month. If Buyer disputes such invoice on the basis
that such payment did not relate to the Transferred Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities, Buyer shall, within [*] of receiving such invoice, give notice
to Seller of such dispute and the Parties shall attempt to immediately resolve
such dispute. All amounts payable by Buyer to Seller pursuant to this Section
4.3, shall be paid in immediately available funds in U.S. dollars to Sellers
account set forth in Section 1.3.



Any payments to third parties on behalf of Buyer associated with the
Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities after the expiration of the [*]
period require Buyers prior written consent. 



4.4 _Consents, Novations and Subcontracted Work_. Buyer and Seller shall use
reasonable efforts to obtain, as soon as practicable, all requisite consents
to transfers, assignments and novations, as the case may be, of all of the
Transferred Assets, Transferred Contracts and the Assumed Liabilities. Buyer
shall cooperate with Seller (including, where necessary, entering into
appropriate instruments of assumption as shall be agreed upon) to have Seller
released from all liability to the contract counterparty with respect to
the Assumed Liabilities, and the Parties will each solicit such releases
concurrently, in a manner acceptable to the Parties, with the solicitation of
consents from third parties to the transfer, assignment and novation of the
Transferred Assets, Transferred Contracts, and the Assumed Liabilities;
provided, that neither Party shall be required to grant any additional
consideration to any third party in order to obtain any such consent,
novation, assignment or release. For any Assumed Liabilities for which Seller
has any secondary liability to third parties, Buyer shall, upon prior written
notice from Seller, provide Seller reasonable access and information in order
for Seller to ascertain continuing compliance by Buyer with all contract
terms and conditions applicable thereto. The consents to transfers,
assignments and novations identified by the Parties as of the Date of
Execution, if any, are listed on Schedule 4.4. If any such required consents
and novations can be secured with the incurring of reasonable costs, Seller
agrees to pay any such costs (excluding those of the Buyer). Where a
Transferred Contract has not been assigned to Buyer on the Closing Date, the
Parties agree to enter into such other arrangements, effective on the Closing
Date, with respect to the underlying rights and obligations as shall permit
Buyer to perform the obligations of Seller thereunder, as a subcontractor or
otherwise, and Buyer to obtain the material benefit thereof (the
"Subcontracted Work") or to have Seller perform the obligations and have the
Buyer receive the material benefit thereof without regard to any costs or
expenses incurred by the Seller in connection thereto other than (i)
any costs or expenses to which Seller is entitled to payment or reimbursement
under any of the other Operative Agreements or (ii) costs and expenses that
would have been incurred by the Buyer had the applicable Transferred Contract
been assigned to the Buyer on the Closing Date ; and until the requisite
consents and novations are obtained, such obligations will not be deemed to be
included in the Assumed Liabilities and nothing contained herein will be
deemed to create an obligation or relationship

of 1934, as amended. that would constitute a breach of the contract underlying such rights and
obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, "material benefit" as used in this
Section 4.4 shall expressly include any payments received by Seller under the
Transferred Contracts after the Closing Date for any products shipped under
the Transferred Contracts after the Closing Date (i) directly by Buyer or
(ii) by Seller on behalf of Buyer using inventory, including that listed on
Schedule 1.1, provided, directly or indirectly, by Buyer. Buyer agrees to
diligently perform and discharge the obligations of Seller in connection with
the Subcontracted Work directly, or indirectly through Seller, as applicable
and to the extent that consents to transfer, assignment and novation are
obtained after the Closing, the Parties agree that such obligations will no
longer be considered to be Subcontracted Work after such time, but will
instead be deemed to be Assumed Liabilities for all purposes of this
Agreement.



4.5 _Product Warranty Services_. Seller shall pay Buyer within [*] after
receipt of invoice from Buyer, for the actual reasonable cost of (a) warranty
services performed by Buyer with respect to In Scope Products sold by Seller
or its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date and (b) software maintenance
services performed by Buyer with respect to any software maintenance
obligations of Seller listed in Schedule 1.4 with respect to software licensed
by Seller prior to the Closing Date. Within [ *] after the Closing Date, Buyer
and Seller shall establish a reasonable mutually agreeable process pursuant
to which Buyer shall provide such warranty services, it being understood that
[*] . At a minimum, such process shall address establishing warranty run rates
and failure rate expectations for each product. In addition, neither Buyers
obligation to provide such warranty services, nor Sellers obligation to pay
for such warranty services, shall cover claims occurring after the maximum
applicable warranty period.



4.6 _Excluded Liabilities_. Seller acknowledges and agrees that Seller shall
retain responsibility for the Excluded Liabilities and that neither Buyer nor
any of Buyers Affiliates shall have any liability or obligation for any such
Excluded Liabilities.



4.7 _Provision of Omitted Assets_. If prior to June 30, 2004 the Buyer or
Seller believes that certain tangible assets and material contracts (other
than any vendor contracts, distributor contracts, or any contracts regarding
intellectual property matters) that are exclusively or primarily used, or
product information that Seller has the legal right to transfer and would not
prejudice Seller with any third party that is exclusively used, in the sale of
the In Scope Products as of the Closing Date were omitted from Schedule 1.1 or
Schedule 1.4, respectively, then the Parties will work in good faith to agree
upon such omitted assets (the "Omitted Assets"). Once identified and agreed
to, the Parties will use reasonable efforts to locate and/or prepare such
items and, subject to Section 4.4, amend the necessary documents and the
Seller shall, at its sole expense, promptly deliver (or transfer in the case
of any contracts) such Omitted Assets to Buyer so as to remedy such error or
omission. So long as there is no dispute as to whether a particular asset is
an Omitted Asset, and the Parties have amended the necessary documents and the
Seller has promptly transferred to Buyer such Omitted Assets, Seller shall
have no further obligation or liability to Buyer regarding such Omitted
Assets.



4.8 _Permitted Liens_. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for the actual reasonable
costs incurred by Buyer to discharge any Permitted Lien existing as of the
Closing Date that adversely affects the value or Buyers use of a Transferred
Asset; provided, however, that Buyer must first

of 1934, as amended. give Seller at least [*] prior written notice of Buyers intention to
discharge the Permitted Lien and an opportunity for Seller, at its option and
expense, to attempt to discharge the underlying Permitted Lien during such [*]
period; provided further that Seller shall have no obligation under this
Section 4.8 to discharge any Lien that is created or granted by Buyer.



4.9 _Seller Conduct Prior to the Closing Date_. During the period between the
Date of Execution to the Closing Date or termination of the Agreement, except
as contemplated under this Agreement or required by applicable law or with the
prior written consent of Buyer, Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) maintain, in a manner consistent with Sellers past practices,
the Transferred Assets (including finished goods inventory) and (ii) preserve
all customer relationships under the Transferred Contracts.



4.10. _Financial Data Covenant_. For the assets and liabilities being
transferred pursuant to this Agreement, Seller shall deliver to Buyer
financial data in the form set forth in Exhibit D to this Agreement (the
"Financial Data") as soon as it is reasonably available from Seller and the
audit for 2003 has been performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC).



Seller shall retain PwC to audit the Financial Data, the purpose of which is
to issue a report with respect thereto.



Seller will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cause PwC to deliver
the results of its audit of the Financial Data as soon as practicable
following the initiation of the audit by PwC.



In the event that Buyer is required by the rules and regulations of the SEC to
file financial statements for the acquired assets for additional 12 month
periods ending December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002, Seller and Buyer will
cooperate, at the Buyers sole expense, to have such financial information
audited by Sellers independent accountants as expeditiously as possible.



Seller will also provide to Buyer unaudited information of the type set for on
Exhibit D, for the three month quarter ending March 31, 2004, which will not
be part of the PwC audit.



Article V.  _Representations and Warranties of Buyer_
