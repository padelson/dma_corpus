written notice of the Third-Party Claim; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that failure to give
such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the

be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses and acknowledges in writing
to the indemnified party its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party therefor, to assume the
defense thereof with counsel selected by the indemnifying party and reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party. Should the indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, unless the
Third-Party Claim involves potential conflicts of interest or substantially different defenses for
the indemnified party and the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense,

counsel, at its own expense (except to the extent provided in the immediately preceding sentence),
separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the
indemnifying party shall control such defense. The indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees
and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party for any period during which the
indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof. All the parties hereto shall cooperate in
the defense or prosecution of any Third-Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the indemnifying party&#146;s request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and
