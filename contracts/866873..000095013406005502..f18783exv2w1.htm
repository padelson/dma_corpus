 2.4 _INVENTORY ADJUSTMENT_. 

  

 (a) _Schedule 2.4(a)_ is a statement setting forth SELLERs good faith estimate of the type and value of the Inventory to be transferred to BUYER pursuant to Section 1.4 on the Closing Date (the "Estimated Inventory Statement"). As soon as practicable, and in any event within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, SELLER shall prepare and deliver 

     ##### 

 

   

to BUYER a statement setting forth the type and value of the Inventory, as of
the Closing Date, that is current, non-obsolete and saleable or useable in
the ordinary course. Such statement shall be derived from a physical taking
of the Inventory as of the Closing Date. The value of Inventory shall be
determined in a manner as described on _Schedule 2.4(a)_ in accordance with
GAAP applied consistently with the Financial Information as such relates to
the valuation of Inventory (the "Closing Inventory Statement" and together
with the Estimated Inventory Statement, the "Statements"). BUYER
shall provide to SELLER and its accountants access to the books and records,
any other information, including working papers of its accountants, and to
any employees of BUYER necessary for SELLER to prepare the Closing Inventory
Statement, to respond to BUYERs Objection (as defined below) and to prepare
materials for presentation to the CPA Firm (as defined below) in connection
with Section 2.4(c). BUYER and SELLER each shall cooperate with and assist
the other party as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of
this Section 2.4. 

   

 (b) BUYER shall, within thirty (30) days after the delivery by SELLER of the Closing Inventory Statement, complete its review thereof. SELLER shall give BUYER reasonable notice of, and BUYER and its representatives shall have the opportunity to observe, the taking of inventory (which may begin prior to the Closing Date) in connection with the calculation of the Closing Inventory Statement, and BUYER and its representatives also shall have the opportunity to verify the status of the Inventory as current, non-obsolete and saleable or usable in the ordinary course. For a period of thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing Inventory Statement, and thereafter as reasonably necessary for BUYER to respond to SELLERs comments on any BUYERs Objection and to prepare materials for presentation to the CPA Firm, SELLER shall as promptly as practicable make available to BUYER all books, records, work papers, personnel (including their accountants and employees) and other materials and sources used by SELLER in or otherwise reasonably related to the preparation of the Closing Inventory Statement. The Closing Inventory Statement shall be binding and conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by, BUYER unless BUYER shall have notified SELLER in writing within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing Inventory Statement of any good faith objection thereto (the "BUYERs Objection"). The BUYERs Objection shall set forth a description of the basis of BUYERs Objection and the adjustments to the value of Inventory reflected on the Closing Inventory Statement which BUYER believes should be made. Any items not disputed during the foregoing thirty (30) day period shall be deemed to have been accepted by BUYER. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (c) If SELLER and BUYER are unable to resolve all of their disputes with respect to the Closing Inventory Statement within thirty (30) days following SELLERs receipt of BUYERs Objection to such Closing Inventory Statement pursuant to Section 2.4(b), they shall refer their remaining differences to an internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants as to which SELLER and BUYER mutually agree (the "CPA Firm") for decision, which decision shall be final and binding on the parties. SELLER and BUYER shall direct the CPA Firm to issue a written report setting forth its determination as quickly as practicable. Any expenses relating to the engagement of the CPA Firm shall be borne proportionately by BUYER and SELLER based on the extent to which BUYERs and SELLERs calculation of the Closing Inventory Statement differ from the CPA Firms determination. SELLER and BUYER shall each bear the fees of their respective auditors incurred in connection with the determination and review of the Statements. 

   

 (d) The Closing Inventory Statement shall become final and binding on the parties upon the earliest of (i) if no BUYERs Objection has been given, the expiration of the period within which BUYER must make its objection pursuant to Section 2.4(b) hereof, (ii) agreement in writing by SELLER and BUYER that the Closing Inventory Statement, together with any modifications thereto agreed by SELLER and BUYER, shall be final and binding and (iii) the date on which the CPA Firm shall issue its written determination with respect to any dispute relating to such Closing Inventory Statement. The Closing Inventory Statement, as submitted by SELLER if no timely BUYERs Objection has been given or as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between the parties or as determined pursuant to the decision of the CPA Firm, when final and binding on all parties, is herein referred to as the "Final Closing Inventory Statement." 

   

 (e) Within ten (10) business days following issuance of the Final Closing Inventory Statement, the net adjustment payment payable pursuant to this Section 2.4(e) (the "Adjustment Payment") and interest thereon shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by SELLER or BUYER, as the case may be. The Adjustment Payment shall be the difference, if any, between (x) the value of Inventory, as reflected on the Final Closing Inventory Statement, minus (y) the value of Inventory, as reflected on the Estimated Inventory Statement. The Adjustment Payment, if any, shall be payable by BUYER to SELLER, if positive, and by SELLER to BUYER, if negative. The Adjustment Payment shall bear interest from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase and Co. in effect on the Closing Date, which interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed and such interest shall be paid on the same date and in the same manner as such Adjustment Payment.

 (d) Enter into, modify in any material respect, amend in any material respect or terminate any material Contract or waive, release or assign any material rights thereunder, or otherwise enter into any contract or transaction relating to the purchase of assets for use in the Business in excess of $500,000 individually. 

   

 (e) Enter into any Contract containing any provision that (i) limits SELLERs ability (or the ability of any subsidiary of SELLER) to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Liens on its property (other than (A) any customary non-assignment provision of any contract or lease governing a leasehold or ownership interest of SELLER or any subsidiary of SELLER and (B) any such provision in favor of any holder of a Capitalized Lease Obligation solely to the extent such provision relates to the property subject to such Capitalized Lease Obligation), (ii) requires the grant of a Lien to secure an obligation of such Person if a Lien is granted to secure another obligation of such Person or (iii) limits the ability of any subsidiary of SELLER to pay dividends, make loans or advances to SELLER and its affiliates or transfer assets to SELLER and its affiliates. 

   

 (f) Enter into any agreement, contract, commitment or arrangement to do anything described above that it is prohibited from doing. 

  

Without limiting the foregoing, SELLER shall consult with BUYER regarding
renewal, extension, amendment or modification of any Contract set forth on 

  ##### 

  

   

_Schedule 3.5(a)_ or _3.5(b)_ , the term of which would otherwise expire
within six (6) months of the Closing Date and, at the written request of
BUYER, shall reasonably cooperate with BUYER and take commercially
reasonable steps to seek to extend or amend the Contracts listed on _Schedule
5.2_ so that such contracts will continue for a term of at least six (6)
months following the Closing Date on terms substantially the same or no worse
than the terms currently in effect, it being understood that BUYER shall be
solely responsible for any costs incurred in connection with SELLER taking any
of such commercially reasonable steps. 

   

 5.3 _DELIVERY_. At the Closing SELLER shall make available to BUYER all Formulations, Specifications and Processing Instructions corresponding to each Product (except that, with respect to past Formulations, Specifications and Processing Instructions, this delivery obligation shall only apply to the extent such past Formulations, Specifications and Processing Instructions are available).

SELLER shall promptly forward or cause to be forwarded to BUYER any and all proceeds from accounts receivable that are not Excluded Assets relating to the Products and which proceeds are received by SELLER after the Closing Date and all associated supporting documents covering cash receipts and customer deductions associated with sales activity after the Closing Date. 

  

 5.5 _USE OF TRADEMARKS, TRADE NAMES AND DESIGNATIONS_. 

  

 (a) To the extent that "Kraft" trademarks, trade names or trade designations or any other trademark, trade name, logo or designation belonging to SELLER following the Closing Date appear on any Inventory, packaging, advertising materials and any other materials related to the Business transferred to BUYER pursuant to Section 1.4 hereof or otherwise transferred to BUYER by SELLER (the "Marked Materials"), BUYER (i) may make packaging materials constituting Marked Materials for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, and (ii) may use and sell or otherwise distribute such Marked Materials in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months following the Closing Date without materially altering or modifying such Marked Materials, or removing such trademarks, trade names or designations, but shall not use such trademarks, trade names or designations in any other manner without the prior written consent of SELLER. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SELLER shall not as a result of this Section 5.5 be liable for any obligations, liabilities or commitments in respect of any Marked Materials shipped or sold at any time after the Closing Date (and for the avoidance of doubt this Section 5.5 shall not affect the liabilities 

    ##### 

  

    

assumed by BUYER or retained by SELLER pursuant to Sections 1.6 and 1.7). In
addition, the parties hereto agree to those matters set forth in _Schedule
5.5(a)_ regarding specified designations with respect to Product packaging. 

   

 (b) Except as otherwise required by applicable law, in no event shall BUYER use the "Kraft" trademark or any other trademark, trade name, logo or designation belonging to SELLER or any of its affiliates following the Closing Date in connection with the advertising or publicizing of the Products other than in accordance with Section 5.5(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, BUYER may use such a trademark, trade name, logo or designation belonging to SELLER or any of its affiliates (1) that appears on a real property building for a period of two months following the Closing, after which period such trademark, trade name, logo or designation belonging to SELLER may no longer appear on BUYERs real property building, or (2) in connection with any ongoing consumer promotion as of the Closing Date, through the expiration of such promotion, or in in-process advertisements, in the event that such trademark, trade name, logo or designation belonging to SELLER cannot be revised without undue effort or substantial cost. 

   

 5.6 _CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION_. Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Collateral Agreements, after the Closing Date, SELLER shall keep secret and retain in strictest confidence, and shall not use for the benefit of itself or others, all information primarily relating to the Business, the Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Products that SELLER did not make generally publicly available during the time period when SELLER conducted the Business (the "Confidential Information"), including Formulations, Specifications, Processing Instructions, "know-how," trade secrets, customer lists, details of client or consultant contracts, pricing policies, marketing plans or strategies, product development techniques or plans, business acquisition plans, designs and design projects, inventions and research projects primarily relating to the Business, the Products, the Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to anyone within SELLER without a need to know or otherwise outside of BUYER except with BUYERs express written consent. Without limiting the foregoing, SELLER shall maintain the confidentiality of the Formulations in accordance with the policies and procedures that were applicable to the Formulations prior to the sale of the Business. 

  

 5.7 _NOTICES OF CERTAIN EVENTS_. SELLER shall as promptly as reasonably practicable notify BUYER of: 

  

 (a) Any material notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) Any material notice or other communication from any governmental authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

   

 (c) Any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced relating to the Business or any Assets that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4; or 

   

 (d) Subject to applicable law, between the date hereof and the Closing Date, SELLER shall provide to BUYER monthly statements of revenue and expenses relating exclusively to the Business as currently prepared on a monthly basis for SELLER. 

   

 5.8 _AUDITED BUSINESS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS_. SELLER will provide or cause to be provided to BUYER following the Closing, such financial information as may be required by BUYER to comply with its obligations under Regulation S-X of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, provided that BUYER shall reimburse SELLER for its out of pocket costs in providing such information. Such information shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, including all required footnotes, and in compliance with the requirements for the form and substance of financial statements (including the periods to be covered) set forth in Regulation S-X and be provided in a timely manner and, in any event, no later than sixty (60) days from Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at BUYERs expense, SELLER shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause its independent auditors to perform any audit required in connection with such information and to deliver to BUYER their report thereon in a timely manner following the Closing, together with any consents required to use or disclose such report. Following the Closing, to the extent required by BUYERs SEC reporting obligations, SELLER will provide to BUYER at such times as BUYER may reasonably request and at BUYERs sole cost and expense additional financial information (such as unaudited interim financial statements of the Business prepared in accordance with GAAP and Regulation S-X). SELLER consents to the use by BUYER of all such information provided solely for such purposes. In addition, the parties hereto agree to those matters regarding the preparation of the audited and unaudited financial statements set forth in _Schedule 5.8_. 

  

 5.9 _TRADE AND CONSUMER PROMOTIONS_. SELLER shall deliver to BUYER on the Closing Date a written list of all trade and consumer promotions relating to the Products. 

  

 5.10 _SCHEDULES UPDATE_. In the event that between the date hereof and the Closing Date, SELLER determines in its good faith judgment 

     ##### 

 

   

that items not included on _Schedule 1.4(c)(i)_ , _Schedule 1.4(c)(iv)_,
_Schedule 1.4(c)(v)_, or _Schedule 1.4(c)(vi)_ relate exclusively to the
Business and would constitute Trademarks, Copyrights, Patents or Domain
Names, SELLER shall update the applicable Schedule to add any such items. 

   

ARTICLE 6 

   

COVENANTS OF BUYER  

  

 BUYER covenants and agrees as follows: 

  

 6.1 _CONFIDENTIALITY_. BUYER acknowledges that all information provided to it by SELLER and its affiliates, agents and representatives is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement between BUYER and SELLER (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, information provided to BUYER or its affiliates that relates primarily to the Business, the Assets and the Assumed Liabilities shall become BUYERs information; and BUYER acknowledges that any and all information provided to it by SELLER concerning SELLER (other than information relating primarily to the Business, the Assets and the Assumed Liabilities) shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the date of the Closing. 

  

 6.2 _ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE_. BUYER shall promptly forward or cause to be forwarded to SELLER any and all proceeds from accounts receivable that are Excluded Assets relating to the Products which proceeds are received by BUYER after the Closing Date. 

  

 6.3 _EMPLOYEE BENEFITS_. 

  

 (a) _Schedule 6.3(a)_ contains a list of each employee of SELLER and its affiliates who is employed in the Business (such list to be updated prior to Closing). All such employees are referred to herein as the "Business Employees." All Business Employees who are union represented employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement are referred to herein as the "Represented Employees," and all Business Employees who are not Represented Employees are referred to herein as the "Salaried Employees." BUYER shall, or shall cause one of its affiliates to, make offers of employment to all Business Employees (including those absent due to vacation, holiday or approved leave of absence, including military leave and leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act) other than Employees on Disability Leave (as defined below). Business Employees who accept such offer of employment, as of the effective date of their employment with BUYER or one of its affiliates, shall be referred to as "Transferred Employees." BUYER shall, or shall cause one of its affiliates to, make offers 

    ##### 

  

    

of employment to each Business Employee who is, as of the Closing Date,
absent due to short-term or long-term disability (the "Employees on Disability
Leave") who is able and willing to return to work within the first year
following the Closing Date;  _provided_ _that_ a job is available at such
time as determined in BUYERs sole discretion. Such offer shall be made
following BUYERs receipt of a medical authorization that releases the
Employee on Disability Leave to return to work within the first year following
the Closing Date. Each Employee on Disability Leave who accepts such offer
and actually returns to work not later than one year after the Closing Date
shall be considered a Transferred Employee, effective as of the date of such
return (the date of such return shall be considered the "Transfer Date" of
each such employee, and the Closing Date shall be considered the Transfer Date
for each other Transferred Employee). 

   

 (b) _Post-Closing Benefits Generally_. As of the Transfer Date of any Transferred Employee, such Transferred Employee shall cease active participation in the Plans. From the Closing Date through December 31, 2007 (the "Benefits Continuation Period"), BUYER shall provide, or shall cause one of its affiliates to provide, to each Transferred Employee who is employed by BUYER and its affiliates (i) base salary and target cash incentives (subject to the terms of BUYERs incentive compensation program except with respect to grade level target incentive percentage thresholds) no less favorable than those provided such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) compensation and employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by BUYER to its own similarly-situated employees; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the employee benefits provided to any Transferred Employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which is assumed by BUYER pursuant to Section 6.3(d) below will be governed by the terms thereof; and _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall require BUYER to continue, or cause any of its affiliates to continue, to employ any Transferred Employee. During the Benefits Continuation Period, the share of premium and similar costs borne by the Salaried Employees for medical and dental coverage under BUYERs welfare benefit plans shall not exceed the comparable costs applicable to such Salaried Employees under SELLERs welfare benefit plans, as the same may be modified from time to time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that within ten (10) business days of receipt of invoices containing proper documentation (which invoices shall be submitted no more frequently than monthly), SELLER shall reimburse BUYER for 65% of the excess of (i) the aggregate employee contribution and similar costs that would have been borne by Salaried Employees under BUYERs welfare benefit plans in the absence of this provision during the time period at issue; over (ii) the actual aggregate employee contribution and similar costs borne by such Salaried Employees during the time period at issue. In the event BUYER cannot, through the 

   ##### 

  

 

exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts, implement the foregoing
employee contribution and similar cost structure for Salaried Employees, as
soon as practicable after the Closing Date, BUYER shall pay to each Salaried
Employee an amount equal to the excess of (i) the estimated aggregate
employee contribution and similar costs that will be borne by such
Salaried Employee under BUYERs welfare benefit plans during the Benefit
Continuation Period; over (ii) the estimated aggregate employee contribution
and similar costs that would have been borne by such Salaried Employee under
SELLERs welfare benefit plans during the Benefits Continuation Period
if such employee had continued to participate in such plans, and SELLER shall
reimburse BUYER, within ten (10) business days of receipt of an invoice (with
appropriate documentation) for 65% of the aggregate payments to Salaried
Employees pursuant to this sentence. The total reimbursements payable by
SELLER to BUYER under this Section 6.3(b) shall not exceed $100,000. 

   

 (c) _Service Credit_. For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of BUYER and its affiliates providing benefits to any Transferred Employee at any time after the Closing Date (the "New Plans"), each Transferred Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with SELLER and its affiliates (and any predecessors) before the Closing Date, to the same extent as such Transferred Employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such service under any comparable Plan in which such Transferred Employee participated immediately before the Closing Date (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"), except for purposes of benefit accrual under any final average pay defined benefit pension plan and (except with respect to Retiree Medical Credit Employees) for eligibility to receive post-retirement welfare benefits under any of the New Plans. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Transferred Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under an Old Plan;  _provided_ , _however_ , that BUYER shall not be obligated to amend or otherwise modify the terms of any New Plans intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code to permit such immediate eligibility and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Transferred Employee, BUYER shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such exclusions or requirements were waived under the corresponding Old Plan, and BUYER shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of 

    ##### 

  

    

satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan. No later than as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Closing Date, SELLER shall provide the administrator of the relevant New
Plans a complete and accurate listing of such expenses incurred by the
Business Employees from January 1, 2006 (or, if earlier, the first day of the
applicable plan year) through the date on which their participation in such
New Plans commences (such listing to be updated periodically to reflect any
such expenses reported following the Closing Date). 

   

 (d) _Labor Matters_. BUYER will assume the collective bargaining agreements identified on _Schedule 6.3(d)_ (collectively, the "CBAs") effective as of the Closing (including the obligation to honor the terms and conditions thereof and any obligations thereunder requiring a successor to recognize a particular labor union as authorized representative of an employee group or for any other purpose). BUYER and its affiliates shall have sole responsibility for all obligations and liabilities arising under the CBAs on and after the Closing Date, and shall indemnify and hold harmless SELLER and its affiliates with respect to any such obligations and liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt, BUYERs assumption of obligations and liabilities under this Section 6.3(d) shall not include any pension (excluding the liabilities assumed by BUYER pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph intended to comply with Section 4204 of ERISA) or retiree medical liabilities arising or accruing prior to the Closing Date. For so long as BUYER is obligated to contribute to the BCT Fund pursuant to the applicable CBA, BUYER will be obligated to contribute to the BCT Fund for substantially the same number of contribution base units for which SELLER had an obligation to contribute thereto. Subject to the next sentence, BUYER will provide to the BCT Fund for a period of five plan years commencing with the first plan year beginning after the Closing Date, a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of Section 412 of ERISA, or an amount held in escrow by a bank or similar financial institution, satisfactory to the BCT Fund, which bond or escrow will be paid to the BCT Fund if BUYER withdraws from the BCT Fund, or fails to make a contribution when due, at any time during the first five plan years beginning after the Closing Date, in an amount equal to the greater of (x) the average annual contribution required to be made by SELLER to the BCT Fund with respect to the operations under the applicable CBA for the three plan years prior to the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs (which average annual contribution, assuming the Closing Date occurs during 2006, is $932,460.59), or (y) the annual contribution that SELLER was required to make to the BCT Fund with respect to the 

    ##### 

  

    

operations under the applicable CBA for the last plan year prior to the plan
year in which the Closing Date occurs (which annual contribution, assuming the
Closing Date occurs during 2006, is $977,607.80). In lieu of providing the
bond or escrow contemplated by the preceding sentence, BUYER may obtain a
waiver, exemption, or variance of the requirement under ERISA that it provide
such bond. If BUYER withdraws from the BCT Fund in a complete withdrawal,
or a partial withdrawal with respect to operations covered by the applicable
CBA, during the first five (5) plan years beginning after the Closing Date,
BUYER will be primarily liable to the BCT Fund, and SELLER will be
secondarily liable to the BCT Fund for any withdrawal liability SELLER would
have had to the BCT Fund with respect to the operations covered by the
applicable CBA (but for Section 4204 of ERISA) if the liability of BUYER with
respect to the BCT Fund is not paid. 

   

 (e) _Severance_. During the Benefits Continuation Period, if BUYER terminates the employment of any Transferred Employee without Cause (as defined below) or subjects any Transferred Employee to any indefinite lay-off, or if any Transferred Employee voluntarily terminates employment either because BUYER and its affiliates have failed to honor the terms of employment required by Section 6.3(b) with respect to such employee or because a condition of continued employment is such employees agreement to relocate to a job site more than fifty (50) miles from such employees job site immediately prior to the Closing Date, BUYER shall pay to such Transferred Employee cash severance in an amount equal to the greatest of (w) the severance pay due under the applicable severance plan of BUYER and its affiliates for similarly situated employees of BUYER and its affiliates (giving service credit for service with BUYER and SELLER and their affiliates), (x) the severance pay that would have been due under the severance plan of SELLER and its affiliates (including a CBA) that was applicable to such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date with service with BUYER after the Closing Date credited for purposes of determining such severance, (y) in the case of exempt Salaried Employees, six (6) months base salary, and (z) in the case of non-exempt Salaried Employees, three (3) months base salary. In addition, BUYER shall continue to provide to each Transferred Employee the type of benefits described in Section 3(1) of ERISA (whether or not covered by ERISA) ("Welfare Benefits") (on the same terms as are applicable to similarly situated active employees, and at no greater cost to such Transferred Employee than would be applicable were such Transferred Employee still employed) during the Severance Period (as defined below),  _provided_ that such Welfare Benefits shall cease to be provided in the event such Transferred Employee becomes eligible for substantially comparable Welfare Benefits from a subsequent employer. BUYER shall provide reasonable outplacement services to any Transferred Employee entitled to severance benefits pursuant to this 

    ##### 

  

    

paragraph. Within ten (10) business days of receipt of invoices containing
proper documentation (which invoices shall be submitted no more frequently
than monthly), SELLER shall reimburse BUYER for 65% of the excess of (i) cash
severance amounts paid pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph over
(ii) the cash severance amounts that would have been payable under the
applicable severance plan of BUYER and its affiliates had the applicable
Transferred Employee incurred a termination of employment entitling such
employee to severance under such plan (assuming for this purpose that the
employee had satisfied all requirements (including execution of a release of
claims) to receive the maximum severance level for which such employee would
have been eligible and that such severance was not offset by any unemployment
compensation, and taking into account service credit for service with BUYER
and SELLER and their affiliates). For purposes of this paragraph, "Cause"
means the Transferred Employees material and willful misconduct, willful
refusal to perform his or her job responsibilities, or conviction of a felony
or non-felony crime involving fraud or dishonesty, and "Severance
Period" shall mean, with respect to any Transferred Employee, a number of
weeks determined by dividing such Transferred Employees cash severance
benefit by such Transferred Employees weekly base rate of pay. 

   

 (f) _Welfare Benefits Generally_. With respect to Transferred Employees, (i) SELLER and its affiliates shall be solely responsible for (A) claims for Welfare Benefits and for workers compensation, in each case that are incurred by or with respect to any Transferred Employee before his or her Transfer Date, and (B) claims relating to health continuation coverage required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA ("COBRA Coverage") attributable to "qualifying events" with respect to any Transferred Employee and his or her beneficiaries and dependents that occur before such Transferred Employees Transfer Date, and (ii) BUYER and its affiliates shall be solely responsible for (A) claims for Welfare Benefits and for workers compensation, in each case that are incurred by or with respect to any Transferred Employee on or after his or her Transfer Date, and (B) claims relating to COBRA Coverage attributable to "qualifying events" with respect to any Transferred Employee and his or her beneficiaries and dependents that occur on or after such Transferred Employees Transfer Date. For purposes of the foregoing, a medical/dental claim shall be considered incurred when the services are rendered, the supplies are provided or medication is prescribed, and not when the condition arose; _provided_ that claims for hospital charges relating to a hospital confinement that begins before the applicable Transfer Date but continues thereafter shall be treated as incurred before such Transfer Date. All claims for other (non-hospital) charges relating to a hospital confinement that begins before the applicable Transfer Date shall be considered incurred when the services are 

    ##### 

  

    

rendered, the supplies are provided or medication is prescribed. A disability
or workers compensation claim shall be considered incurred before the
applicable Transfer Date if the injury or condition giving rise to the claim
occurs before such Transfer Date, but only if such claim is actually filed
before the first anniversary of such Transfer Date. 

   

 (g) _Medical Flexible Spending Plans_. As of the Closing Date, BUYER will establish flexible spending accounts for medical and dependent care expenses under a new or existing plan ("BUYERs FSA") for each Transferred Employee who, on or prior to the Closing Date, is a participant in a flexible spending account for medical and dependent care expenses under an Employee Benefit Plan ("SELLERs FSA") or who elects to participate in BUYERs FSA. Subject to BUYER being provided all information reasonably necessary to permit the administrator of BUYERs FSA to accommodate the inclusion of the Transferred Employees in BUYERs FSA on the basis described herein, BUYER will credit or debit, as applicable, effective as of the Closing Date, the applicable account of each Transferred Employee under BUYERs FSA with an amount equal to the balance of each such Transferred Employees account under SELLERs FSA as of immediately prior to the Closing Date. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, SELLER will pay to BUYER the net aggregate amount of the account balances credited under BUYERs FSA, if such amount is positive, and BUYER will pay to SELLER the net aggregate amount of the account balances credited under BUYERs FSA, if such amount is negative. No later than as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, SELLER shall provide to BUYER a complete and accurate listing of year-to-date contributions and reimbursements under SELLERs FSA for the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs (such listing to be updated periodically to reflect any such information reported following the Closing Date). 

   

 (h) _Vacation_. From and after the Closing Date, BUYER shall assume and honor all earned but unused vacation days of the Transferred Employees that accrued prior to the applicable Transfer Date, and shall hold harmless SELLER and its affiliates in respect of any liabilities with respect to such accrued vacation. 

   

 (i) _Qualified Retirement Plans_. SELLER will retain all liabilities and obligations under Plans that are Qualified Plans in respect of benefits accrued thereunder by Business Employees prior to the Closing Date. No Transferred Employee will accrue any benefit under such plans in respect of service with BUYER after the Closing Date. No assets or liabilities of any Plan that is a Qualified Plan will be transferred to a retirement plan maintained by BUYER. BUYER shall cause a tax-qualified defined contribution plan established or maintained by BUYER or its applicable 

    ##### 

  

    

affiliate to accept eligible rollover distributions (as defined in Section
402(c)(4) of the Code) from Transferred Employees with respect to any account
balances (including loans) distributed on or as of the Closing Date by
applicable Plans. The distributions and rollovers described herein shall
comply with applicable law and each party shall make all filings and take any
actions required of such party under applicable law in connection therewith. 

   

 (j) _Cash Compensation Obligations_. SELLER and its affiliates shall retain liability for payment of base salary, wages and overtime pay for each Business Employee accruing prior to such Business Employees Transfer Date, and BUYER and its affiliates shall assume responsibility for payments of base salary, wages and overtime pay to each Transferred Employee accruing on or after such Business Employees Transfer Date. SELLER shall make a prorated annual bonus payment to each Business Employee who remains employed through the Closing Date, the amount of which shall equal the product of the applicable Business Employees annual bonus amount (as described in the next sentence) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the calendar year during which the Closing Date occurs that elapse prior to the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is 365. SELLER may determine the annual bonus amount using any good faith methodology (which need not be the same for each Business Employee), including by basing such amount upon target bonus or upon actual performance. Such prorated bonuses shall be paid no later than the date on which SELLER pays annual bonuses to similarly situated other employees of SELLER and its affiliates. 

   

 (k) _WARN Act_. On the Closing Date, SELLER shall provide a list of any and all employees at the Facilities who have experienced, or will experience, an employment loss as defined by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or any similar law requiring notice to employees in the event of a plant closing or layoff (the "WARN Act") within 90 days prior to the Closing Date. SELLER shall not, at any time within the 90 days before the Closing Date, without complying fully with the notice requirements and other requirements of the WARN Act, effectuate at the Facilities a plant closing or mass layoff. BUYER shall be responsible for providing WARN Act notice of any plant closing or mass layoff at the Facilities that takes place after the Closing Date. BUYER shall assume liability for, and shall fully indemnify and hold harmless SELLER and its affiliates with respect to, any liabilities incurred by SELLER and its affiliates either (i) pursuant to the WARN Act and any similar statute in connection with any Business Employee, to the extent such liability arises from actions of BUYER and its affiliates or (ii) as a result of a failure to extend an offer complying with the requirements of this Section 6.3 to a Business Employee (including any such severance or WARN Act liabilities). 

    ##### 

  

     

 6.4 _HUMANE TREATMENT_. BUYER agrees that, following the Closing Date, it will treat all cats and dogs used in the Business (the "Animals") humanely and agrees that it will not injure or destroy any Animals, other than euthanasia in the best medical interest of an Animal. 

  

 6.5 _AS 400 AND OTHER COMPUTER EQUIPMENT_. Following completion of the transition services period with respect to the services described as "AS400 Server" and "Computer Equipment" in Annex A of the Transition Services Agreement, BUYER shall provide SELLER reasonable access to the Buffalo Facility to remove the AS 400 computer server and other computer equipment constituting Excluded Assets. 

  

 6.6 _PRIVACY POLICY_. Following the Closing, BUYER agrees to abide by the policies set forth in _Exhibit F_ to this Agreement with respect to the user information and data referred to in Section 1.4(h). 

  

 6.7 _COMMON TRANSFERRED IP_. To the extent that there is any Common Transferred IP, BUYER, on behalf of itself and its affiliates, to the extent of its rights with respect to the Common Transferred IP, hereby grants to SELLER a nonexclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use and exploit such Common Transferred IP in connection with the operation of the business of SELLER and its affiliates. Such right and license shall include, to the extent of BUYERs rights with respect to the Common Transferred IP, (a) the right to disclose such Common Transferred IP in furtherance of any business use in the business of SELLER and its affiliates, subject to SELLER entering into customary confidentiality arrangements with any third party recipients thereof, and (b) SELLERs right to grant licenses and/or sublicenses with respect to the Common Transferred IP in furtherance of any business use in the business of SELLER and its affiliates. 

  

 6.8 _PURCHASE ORDERS_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing (and in no event later than five (5) business days following the Closing) SELLER shall deliver to BUYER copies of all Purchase Orders (or the portion of any other purchase order of SELLER or its affiliates relating to any of the Products) that are outstanding as of the Closing Date.

retain, any of their businesses, products or assets, including the Business
and all Products and Assets. 

   

 (b) Without limiting Section 7.1(a), SELLER and BUYER shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to: 

   

 (i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, on or before the End Date (as defined in Section 9.1(d)), including defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any Person; and 

  

 (ii) to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under the HSR Act that may be asserted by any governmental authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the End Date);  _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, BUYER shall not be required to sell, license, divest, dispose of or hold separate, or otherwise take or commit to take, or consent to the taking of, any action limiting BUYERs freedom of action with respect to, or BUYERs or BUYERs affiliates, freedom to retain, any assets, products or businesses of BUYER or SELLER (or their respective affiliates or subsidiaries) including the Business and any Products or Assets.

 7.2 _COOPERATION_. BUYER and SELLER shall reasonably cooperate with each other and shall cause their officers, employees, agents and representatives to reasonably cooperate with each other for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing to ensure the orderly transition of the Assets and the Assumed Liabilities to BUYER and to minimize the disruption to the respective businesses of the parties hereto resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby.

the conduct of its business. 

   

 7.3 _PUBLICITY_. SELLER and BUYER agree that, from the date hereof through the Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by a party without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by law or the rules or regulations of any United States or foreign securities exchange.

with any and all penalties, interest and additions to tax with respect
thereto ("Nonrecoverable Transfer Taxes," and, together with Recoverable

In the event the value of the Facilities is estimated for purposes of such New York State transfer tax returns and differs from the purchase price allocated to the Facilities in the Final Allocation, the parties shall amend the transfer tax returns to reflect the results of the Final Allocation and, if necessary, the parties will pay any additional transfer taxes arising from such amended returns in accordance with this Agreement. 

   

 (d) In the case of any Tax Return with respect to a Straddle Period required to be filed by BUYER after the Closing, SELLER shall pay BUYER the amount of any Excluded Tax that is or would otherwise be payable with respect to such Tax Return at least five business days prior to the later of the date such payment is or would otherwise be due (the "Due Date"); _provided_ that BUYER shall furnish SELLER with a copy of BUYERS 

    ##### 

  

    

calculations with respect to such Excluded Taxes a period of time prior to
the relevant Due Date reasonably sufficient to enable SELLER to review
and approve such calculations. 

   

 7.8 _EMPLOYEE NON-SOLICITATION_.

No action or proceeding may be brought with respect to any of the representations and warranties unless written notice thereof, setting forth in reasonable detail the claimed misrepresentation or breach of warranty, shall have been delivered to the party alleged to have breached such representation or warranty prior to the Expiration Date or such later expiration date as is described above. 

   ##### 

  

  

 8.2 _INDEMNIFICATION BY SELLER_. SELLER shall indemnify BUYER, its affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and hold them harmless from and against any loss, liability, claim, cost, damage or expense (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) (collectively, "Losses") suffered or incurred by any such indemnified party to the extent arising from: 

  

 (a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of SELLER contained in this Agreement (including in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement on the Closing Date), 

   

 (b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of SELLER contained in this Agreement, and 

   

 (c) the Excluded Liabilities; 

  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) SELLER shall not have any liability under
clause (a) above (other than with respect to breaches of Section 3.2 ( _Title
to Tangible Assets_ ), Section 3.3 ( _Intellectual Property_ ), Section 3.7 (
_Brokers_ ) and Section 3.16(b) ( _Sufficiency of Assets_ )) unless the
aggregate of all Losses relating thereto for which SELLER would, but for this
proviso, be liable exceeds on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to one
percent (1%) of the Final Purchase Price (the "Basket"), and then only to the
extent that the aggregate of all such Losses relating thereto exceeds the
Basket, and (y) SELLER shall not have any liability under clause (a) above
with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of
SELLER contained in Section 3.3 ( _Intellectual Property_ ) unless the
aggregate of all Losses relating thereto for which SELLER would, but for this
proviso, be liable exceeds on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to one half
of one percent (0.5%) of the Final Purchase Price (the "IP Basket") and then
only to the extent that the aggregate of all such Losses relating thereto
exceeds the IP Basket; and _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that SELLERs
aggregate liability under clause (a) above (other than with respect to
breaches of Section 3.7 ( _Brokers_ )) shall in no event exceed fifteen
percent (15%) of the Final Purchase Price (the "Cap"). For the avoidance of
doubt, (1) Losses with respect to matters not subject to the Basket that are
paid by SELLER to BUYER or its affiliates shall not count towards the Basket
or the IP Basket, (2) any Losses that count towards the IP Basket shall also
count towards the Basket and (3) any Losses that count towards the Basket
shall also count towards the IP Basket. 

   

 8.3 _INDEMNIFICATION BY BUYER_. BUYER shall indemnify SELLER and its respective officers, directors, employees and agents from and against and hold them harmless from any Loss suffered or incurred by any such indemnified party to the extent arising from

 (c) the Assumed Liabilities; 

  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that BUYER shall not have any liability under clause
(a) above (other than with respect to breaches of Section 4.4 ( _Brokers_ ))
unless the aggregate of all Losses relating thereto for which BUYER would,
but for this proviso, be liable exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal
to the Basket, and then only to the extent that the aggregate of all
such Losses relating thereto exceeds the Basket; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that BUYERs aggregate liability under clause (a) above (other
than with respect to breaches of Section 4.4 ( _Brokers_ )) shall in no event
exceed the Cap. 

   

 8.4 _EXCLUSIVE REMEDY; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY_. BUYER and SELLER (a) each acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing, their sole and exclusive remedy, with respect to any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article 8, and (b) in furtherance of the foregoing, hereby waive, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action, they may have against each other relating to the subject matter of this Agreement arising under or based upon any federal, state or local statute, law (including common law), ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise, except for, in the case of each of clause (a) and (b), (x) claims for specific performance or injunctive or other equitable relief and (y) claims for fraud or intentional misrepresentation. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 8.4 shall not affect any remedies provided in any Collateral Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither BUYER nor SELLER shall be liable under this Agreement for any special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages (including lost or anticipated revenues or profits relating to the same) arising from any claim relating to this Agreement, whether such claim is based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence or strict liability) or otherwise. 

  

 8.5 _LOSSES NET OF INSURANCE; TAX BENEFITS_. The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this Article 8 shall be net of (a) any amounts actually recovered by the indemnified party under its insurance policies with respect to such Losses and (b) any tax benefit actually realized by the indemnified party or its affiliates arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Losses. Each party hereby waives, to the 

   ##### 

  

 

extent permitted under its applicable insurance policies, any subrogation
rights that its insurer may have with respect to any indemnified Losses. 

   

 8.6 _PROCEDURES RELATING TO INDEMNIFICATION_. 

  

 (a) In order for an indemnified party to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Article 8 in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any person, firm, governmental authority or corporation against the indemnified party (a "Third-Party Claim"), such indemnified party must notify the indemnifying party in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third-Party Claim as promptly as reasonably possible after receipt by such indemnified party of written notice of the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. The indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party, within five business days (or sooner, if the nature of the asserted liability so requires) after the indemnified partys receipt thereof, copies of all written notices and documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the Third-Party Claim. 

   

 (b) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses and acknowledges in writing to the indemnified party its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party therefor, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the indemnifying party and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Should the indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, unless the Third-Party Claim involves potential conflicts of interest or substantially different defenses for the indemnified party and the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense (except to the extent provided in the immediately preceding sentence), separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense. The indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party for any period during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof. All the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Third-Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying partys request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and information that are reasonably relevant 

    ##### 

  

    

to such Third-Party Claim and reasonably available to the indemnified party,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, and making employees available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. If the indemnifying party shall have
assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not
enter into any settlement of or otherwise compromise or discharge such Third-
Party Claim without the indemnified partys prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless such
settlement, compromise or discharge irrevocably releases the indemnified
party from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third-Party
Claim and does not impose any injunctive or other equitable relief against
the indemnified party. Whether or not the indemnifying party shall have
assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third-Party Claim without the indemnifying partys prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   

 (c) Anything to the contrary in this Section 8.6 notwithstanding, if a Third-Party Claim includes or could reasonably be expected to include both a claim for Taxes that are Excluded Taxes and a claim for Taxes that are not Excluded Taxes, and such claim for Taxes that are Excluded Taxes is not separable from such a claim for Taxes that are not Excluded Taxes, SELLER (if the claim for Taxes that are Excluded Taxes exceeds or reasonably could be expected to exceed in amount the claim for Taxes that are not Excluded Taxes) or otherwise the BUYER (SELLER or BUYER, as the case may be, the "Controlling Party"), shall be entitled to control the defense of such Third-Party Claim (such Third-Party Claim, a "Tax Claim"). In such case, the other party (SELLER or BUYER, as the case may be, the "Non-Controlling Party") shall be entitled to participate fully (at the Non-Controlling Partys sole expense) in the conduct of such Tax Claim and the Controlling Party shall not settle such Tax Claim without the consent of such Non-Controlling Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). The costs and expenses of conducting the defense of such Tax Claim shall be reasonably apportioned based on the relative amounts of the Tax Claim that are Excluded Taxes and the Tax Claim that are not Excluded Taxes. 

   

 8.7 _EFFECT OF KNOWLEDGE_. The representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or any Collateral Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to any thereof, shall not be affected by any investigation, verification or examination by any party hereto or by any representative of any such party. 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE 9 
 TERMINATION
