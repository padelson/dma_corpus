plan and not the Companys pension plan) (" _Company Pension Obligation_
"), over the fair market value as of the Closing Date of assets accumulated
to provide for the Company Pension Obligation, using an exchange rate of

of their wholly owned Subsidiaries as recorded on the books and records
thereof as of Closing ( _other than_ any cash or cash equivalents that are
"blocked," or otherwise restricted from use or withdrawal or repatriation to
the U.S. as a result of exchange controls or similar restrictions);
_provided_ , for purposes of this Agreement, in no event shall such amount
exceed $2,500,000 in the aggregate.

other place and on such other date as is mutually agreeable to the parties ("
_Closing Date_ ").

  



  

(b) At the Closing:

  



  

(i) Buyer shall pay the Estimated Closing Purchase Price to Seller by wire

to be delivered to Buyer under Section 7.2(g) below, and Buyer shall deliver
to Seller the documents required to be delivered to Seller under Section
7.3(c) below.

  



  

1.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) Within 90 days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Seller its calculation (to be made in accordance with the terms of
Section 1.2) of the Cash Obligation Liabilities Excess Amount (if any), the
Cash Amount and the Accrued Unfunded Pension Liability (the "
_Proposed Closing Statement_ " and, in its final and binding form
after resolution of any disputes pursuant to this Section 1.4(a), the "
_Actual Closing Statement_ ") and the adjusted Closing Purchase Price
resulting from the Proposed Closing Statement, together with a copy of all
supporting work papers (including schedules, memoranda and other documents)
utilized in the preparation of the Proposed Closing Statement and the
calculation of the Closing Purchase Price, and Seller shall have a period of
30 days (the " _Objection Period_ ") after delivery of the Proposed Closing
Statement in which to provide written notice to Buyer of any objections
thereto (the " _Objection Notice_ "), setting forth the specific item of the
Proposed Closing Statement to which each such objection relates and the basis
for each such objection in reasonable detail. The Proposed Closing Statement
and the resulting Closing Purchase Price shall be deemed to be accepted by
Seller, and shall become final and binding on the parties, on the later of
the expiration of the Objection Period or the date on which all objections
have been resolved by the parties or the Accountant (as defined below)
pursuant to this Section 1.4(a). If Seller gives any such Objection Notice
within the Objection Period, then Seller and Buyer shall attempt in good
faith to resolve any dispute concerning the item(s) subject to such Objection
Notice as soon as practicable.  If Seller and Buyer do not resolve any
dispute arising in connection with the Proposed Closing Statement within the
time period specified below, such dispute shall be resolved in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Section 1.4(b) below.

  



  

(b) If Buyer and Seller have not been able to resolve a dispute within 30
days after the date of delivery of the Objection Notice, which 30 day period
may be extended by written agreement of Buyer and Seller (such period, as it
may be extended, the " _Initial Resolution Period_ "), the parties shall
submit such dispute to, and such dispute shall be resolved fully, finally and
exclusively by a mutually agreeable nationally recognized independent
accounting firm (the " _Accountant_ "). The fees and expenses of Accountant
incurred in the resolution of such dispute shall be borne equally by Buyer
and Seller. Buyer and Seller shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause the Accountant to issue a written determination to Seller
and Buyer as promptly as practicable, but in any event within 30 days,
following the date on which the Proposed Closing Statement is delivered to
the Accountant, with such

  



  

4      
   



  

determination based on the written submissions and other information
requested by the Accountant related to the disputed items that have been
submitted by the parties to the Accountant, as to whether and to what extent
(if any) the Proposed Closing Statement and resulting adjustment in the
Closing Purchase Price require adjustment. The parties shall instruct the
Accountant to, and shall use their respective best efforts to cause
the Accountant to, make its determination in a manner consistent with
Section 1.2(c) hereof. Such written determination shall provide a written
explanation in reasonable detail of each such required adjustment, including
the basis therefor. All negotiations pursuant to this Section 1.4(b) shall be
treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of Rule 408 of
the Federal Rules of Evidence and comparable state rules of evidence, and all
negotiations, submissions to the Accountant, and arbitration proceedings
under this Section 1.4(b) shall be treated as confidential information. The
Accountant shall be bound by a mutually agreeable confidentiality agreement.
The procedures of this Section 1.4(b) are exclusive and the determination of
the Accountant shall be final, non-appealable and binding on the parties.
 The decision rendered pursuant to this Section 1.4(b) may be filed as
a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Either party may seek
specific enforcement or take other necessary legal action to enforce any
decision under this Section 1.4(b). The other partys only defense to such
a request for specific enforcement or other legal action shall be fraud by or
on the part of the Accountant. Absent such fraud, such other party shall
reimburse the party seeking enforcement for its Third Party Expenses (as
defined in Section 11.2 hereof) related to such enforcement.

  



  

(c) Promptly after the Actual Closing Statement, the Adjustments and the
resulting Closing Purchase Price calculated with reference thereto become
final and binding on the parties under subsections (a) and (b) of this
Section 1.4, the Estimated Closing Purchase Price shall be recalculated by
giving effect to such final and binding amounts (as recalculated, the "
_Final Closing Purchase Price_ ").

  



  

(i) If the Estimated Closing Purchase Price is greater than the Final Closing
Purchase Price, Seller shall pay to Buyer within one business day by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, the amount by which the Estimated
Closing Purchase Price exceeds the Final Closing Purchase Price.

  



  

(ii) If the Estimated Closing Purchase Price is less than the Final Closing
Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay to Seller within one business day by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, the amount by which the Final
Closing Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Closing Purchase Price.

  



  

1.5 _Right to Revise Structure_. By notice to Parent within 20 days of
the date hereof, Buyer may elect to revise the structure of the
transactions contemplated hereby to cause one or more of its wholly owned
subsidiaries to acquire 100% of the stock of one or more of the Companies
and/or their respective Subsidiaries on the same terms and conditions set
forth herein in all respects (other than such mutually agreed changes as are
necessary to implement the revised structure); _provided, however_ , that in
no event shall Parent or Seller be required to proceed to implement any such
revised structure that would reasonably be expected to (a) delay, impede,
prevent or otherwise adversely effect the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby in any respect (including, without limitation, the
receipt of any regulatory approvals and consents or any other approvals or
consents), (b) result in any additional tax cost

  



  

5      
   



  

or other cost, expense or other liability (contingent or otherwise) to Parent
or Seller or their Affiliates, (c) adversely effect the likelihood of the
receipt of regulatory approvals and consents or any other approvals and
consents by any party hereto or (d) otherwise be less advantageous to Parent
or Seller than the structure contemplated hereby.

  



  

1.6 _Taking of Necessary Action_. Buyer, Parent, Seller and the
Companies, respectively, shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to
take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the
Acquisition at the time specified in Section 1.3 hereof.

modifications, abandonments, accelerations, authorizations, consents,
approvals, exemptions, other actions or notices that, individually or in the

Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Companies and the Subsidiaries is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation to do business in every jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or its ownership of property requires it to
be so qualified, except for those jurisdictions in which the failure to be so
qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect (as defined below).  Section 3.1 of the Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true and complete list, by corporation, of all jurisdictions in
which the Companies and each of the Subsidiaries is qualified and in good
standing, if applicable. As used herein, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_
" means any change, effect, event or condition that (i) has had or would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the business, assets (including intangible assets), results
of operations or financial condition of the Companies and the Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, other than any such change, effect, event or condition that
results or arises from (A) changes or conditions affecting the industry in
which the Companies operate or market or produce their products and services
generally, except to the extent such changes or conditions disproportionately
affect the Companies and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) changes in
general economic, regulatory or political conditions or resulting from armed
hostilities or terrorist actions, except to the extent such changes or
conditions or results disproportionately affect the Companies and the
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (C) the announcement of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, or (ii) would prevent or materially delay the
Companies, Sellers or Parents ability to consummate the Acquisition or the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b) None of the Companies or the Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the
provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or other applicable charter
document (any such document hereinafter referred to as its "
_Charter Documents_ ") or Bylaws or other applicable governing document
(any such documents hereinafter referred to as its " _Governing Documents_
"). The Companies have delivered to Buyer accurate and complete copies of the
respective Charter Documents and Governing Documents, as currently in effect,
of each of the Companies and the Subsidiaries.

  



  

8      
   



  

3.2 _Subsidiari_ _es_. The Companies are the record and beneficial owners of
the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the entities listed (and

Companies or Subsidiaries normal operations; and _provided_ , that all such
access under this Section 5.2 and under Section 5.3, as well as all
integration planning under Section 5.4, shall be coordinated through
the senior officers of the Companies after consultation with Seller,
which consultation shall occur as promptly as reasonably practicable so as
not to unreasonably delay any such access; and _provided, however_ , that
neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall have the right to receive
or obtain any information relating to Taxes or Returns of the Parent, Seller
or any of their affiliates, or any of their respective predecessors other
than information relating solely to any of the Companies or the Subsidiaries.

reasonable efforts and to act in good faith to develop a limited list of
customers and suppliers of the Companies and the Subsidiaries that Buyer may
contact with respect to the Acquisition (provided that any such contact shall
be initiated by, and at all times conducted in the presence of,
representatives of the Companies or Parent), as well as a communication plan
with respect to such customers and suppliers that is acceptable to Parent,
which acceptance will not be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

5.4 _Integration Plan_ _ning_. Subject to Section 5.2, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the parties agree to cooperate in good
faith to enable Buyer to work with senior management and other subject matter

of the Companies in all cases and not unreasonably interfere with the
Companies or Subsidiaries normal business operations.

securities applicable to such party for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein. Parent (on behalf of itself, Seller and the Companies)
will coordinate and cooperate with Buyer (or its affiliates) and Buyer will
coordinate and cooperate with Parent in exchanging such information necessary
to make such filings. Any cooperation provided by any party to the other
parties towards making the necessary filings and obtaining the

  



  

30      
   



  

necessary approvals shall not derogate from or release such party from its
obligations to make the necessary filings and obtain the necessary approvals
applicable to such party for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein.

  



  

6.2 _Conditions_.  Each of Buyer, Seller, Parent and the Companies shall take
all commercially reasonable actions necessary or desirable to comply promptly
with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party with respect
to the Acquisition and will promptly cooperate with and furnish such
information to any other party hereto in connection with any such
requirements imposed upon such other party in connection with the
Acquisition. Each party will take all commercially reasonable actions
to obtain (and will cooperate with the other parties in obtaining) any
consent, authorization, order or approval of or any registration, declaration
or filing with, or an exemption by any Governmental Entity, or other third
party, required to be obtained or made by such party in connection with the
Acquisition or the taking of any action contemplated thereby or by this
Agreement, including all consents, waivers or approvals required under any
Contracts disclosed in Section 3.12 of the Disclosure Schedule;
_provided, however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to agree to (i)
any divestiture by Buyer or the Companies or any of Buyers subsidiaries
or Affiliates shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property
of Buyer or its subsidiaries or Affiliates or of the Companies or its
Affiliates that would result in the disposition of control over assets
generating annual revenues of more than $10,000,000 (as determined from the
latest twelve trailing months income statements) or (ii) the imposition of
any material limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their
business or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock.

  



  

6.3 _No Negotiations_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier to occur of the Closing Date or termination of this Agreement
pursuant to its terms, Parent, Seller and the Companies shall not, and each
of Parent, Seller and the Companies will instruct their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, representatives and Affiliates, not to,
directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or encourage submission of any
proposal or offer from any Person (including any of its or their officers or
employees, representatives, agents, or affiliates) relating to any
liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization, tender or exchange offer,
solicitation of proxies, merger, consolidation or acquisition or purchase of
all or a material portion of the assets of, or any equity interest in, the
Companies or any of the Subsidiaries or other similar transaction or business
combination involving the Companies or any of the Subsidiaries, or
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
other Person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any
way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or
attempt by any other Person to do or seek any of the foregoing. Parent shall
promptly notify Buyer if any such proposal or offer, or any inquiry from or
contact with any Person with respect thereto, is made and shall promptly
provide Buyer with such information regarding such proposal, offer, inquiry
or contact as Buyer may request. In addition, from and after the date of
this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Closing Date or the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms, Parent, Seller
and Companies shall not, and each of Parent, Seller and the Companies
shall instruct their respective directors, officers, employees,
representatives, agents and Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, make
or authorize any public statement, recommendation or solicitation in support
of any proposal made by any Person or group (other than Buyer) relating to
any of the foregoing. The parties agree, however, that nothing in the
foregoing sentences of this Section 6.3 shall prohibit Parent from entering
into any agreement, discussion or negotiation with or providing any
information to any third party who

  



  

31      
   



  

has made a bona fide unsolicited offer to acquire (whether by way of merger,
purchase of the equity or assets of Parent or otherwise) Parent if the Board
of Directors of Parent determines in good faith and after receipt of advice
of outside counsel that the failure to provide such information or engage in
such discussions or negotiations could reasonably be expected to result in a
breach of Parents Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  



  

6.4 _Employee Matte_ _rs_.

  



  

(a) Employees of the Companies and the Subsidiaries immediately following the
Closing Date (the " _Company Employees_ ") shall continue as employees of the
Companies and the Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, subject to the right of
the Companies and the Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to terminate the
employment of such employees in accordance with Law.

  



  

(b) Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide, or cause to be provided,
compensation and benefits for the Company Employees that is reasonable and
appropriate under the circumstances, including, for a period of one year
following the Closing Date, at least the same base salary as was in effect
for each such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) Each Company Employee shall be entitled to roll over to a Buyer vacation
plan and Buyer shall honor any accrued but unused vacation days as of the
Closing Date.

  



  

6.5 _Benefit Plan_ _s_.

  



  

(a) _Krone SERP_. Buyer does not assume and shall have no obligation to
provide, and Seller shall retain all liabilities, responsibilities and
obligations for, any non-qualified deferred compensation benefits, severance
benefits or enhanced severance benefits to which any employee or former
employee of the Companies and the Subsidiaries may be or become entitled or
claim to be entitled under the Krone Incorporated Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan.

  



  

(b) _GenTek KERP_. From and after the Closing, Buyer will assume all
liabilities, responsibilities and obligations for any severance benefits (i)
to which any Contract Employee may become entitled under the GenTek Key
Employee Retention Plan (the " _GenTek KERP_ "), and (ii) subject to Parents
obligation to bear the first $1,000,000 of severance benefits to become due
and payable under the terms of the GenTek KERP (if the terminations or
resignations of employment giving rise to such $1,000,000 occur within the
first twelve months after the Closing Date), to any other employee of the
Companies and the Subsidiaries thereunder, and with respect to any
terminations or resignations that occur after the twelve-month anniversary of
the Closing Date, any and all severance benefits. Except as provided in
the foregoing sentence, neither Parent nor Seller shall be responsible for,
and Buyer shall assume and indemnify and hold harmless Parent and Seller in
respect of, all liabilities, responsibilities and obligations for any
severance benefits due and payable under the GenTek KERP to any employee
whose employment is terminated with Buyer or one of its Affiliates and within
one year thereafter such employee is rehired by, or otherwise provides any
compensated services to, Buyer or one of its Affiliates and shall in addition
promptly reimburse Seller or Parent in respect of any payment made by it on
account of such severance benefits paid to any such employees.

  



  

32      
   



  

(c) _Krone MIP_. Seller has previously delivered to Buyer the final terms of
the Acquired Companies management incentive plan for 2004 as presently in
effect (the " _Krone 2004 MIP_ "), including but not limited to the financial
targets under the Krone 2004 MIP for the relevant period and the weightings
for the financial metrics used thereunder. Buyer and Seller agree that,
assuming that the Closing occurs and contingent upon the Closing occurring,
payments under the Krone 2004 MIP will be calculated on a pro rated, partial
year basis as of the Closing Date, such calculation to be made by Buyer in
accordance with the terms of the Acquired Companies management
incentive plan for 2003 (" _Krone 2003 MIP")_ as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date. Following the Closing, Buyer shall
cause the Acquired Companies to make such payments to eligible employees that
are due in accordance with the Krone 2004 MIP pursuant to the preceding
sentence as soon as reasonably practicable after such calculation has been
made by Buyer.

  



  

(d) _Non-Business Plans_. To the extent Section 3.17 of the
Disclosure Schedule discloses non-Business Plans, Parent will take all
appropriate steps to ensure that (i) the employees of the Companies and
Subsidiaries who are covered under any non-Business plans which are
retirement plans become fully vested in their benefits accrued under such
plans as of the Closing Date, to the extent permitted under such non-Business
Plans, and (ii) coverage under all such non-Business plans will cease as of
Closing, and Parent shall retain all liabilities, responsibilities, and
obligations for the benefits due to the employees or former employees of the
Companies and the Subsidiaries with respect to benefits accrued through
Closing.  Parent agrees to make distributions available to the employees of
the Companies and the Subsidiaries under any 401(k) plan that is a non-
Business Plan, including a distribution of outstanding loans, if any. If any
non-Business Plans provide welfare benefits, Parent shall be liable for all
claims allocated to the period ending on Closing. Claims will be allocated
in general according to the date on which the claim is incurred (that is, the
date of the event or events causing a covered individual to become eligible
to receive benefit payments, regardless of the dated of filing the claim).
Coverage under non-Business Plans which are welfare plans will cease upon
Closing for employees of the Companies and the Subsidiaries, subject to
Parents obligation to permit continued coverage for a reasonable period of
time after Closing under the Transition Services Agreement.

  



  

(e) _Credit for Service_. Buyer shall cause each applicable employee benefit
plan, program, policy and arrangement of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer,
including, without limitation, any pension plans, welfare plans, short-term
disability plans, vacation plans, retiree medical plans and severance plans,
to recognize (i) for purposes of satisfying any deductibles, co-pays and out-
of-pocket maximums in any health or other insurance plan of Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer, any payment made by any employee during the coverage
period up to the Closing towards deductibles, co-pays and out-of-pocket
maximums in any health or other insurance plan of Parent, Seller or any of
their Affiliates and (ii) for purposes of determining eligibility
to participate, vesting thereunder and benefit accruals (except for the
purposes of accruals under any defined benefit plan of Buyer or an Affiliate
of Buyer), all service of a Company Employee with Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller. Buyer agrees that its health and welfare plans (or such plans of an
Affiliate of Buyer) shall (i) waive any pre-existing condition exclusion with
respect to employees and any proof of insurability and (ii) recognize as
dependents of the Company Employees any dependents recognized by the Sellers
or an Affiliate of Sellers health and welfare plans. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such crediting of

  



  

33      
   



  

service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such
benefit and shall not be credited if such service is prior to a specific date
before which service would not have been credited for employees of Buyer or
an Affiliate of Buyer.

  



  

(f) _Tax Qualified Plans_. Parent shall fully vest all Company Employees in
its tax-qualified defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans (but
only to the extent such plans are non-Business Plans) as of the Closing Date.
As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer shall designate a
tax-qualified defined contribution plan of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer
that either (i) currently provides for the receipt from Company Employees of
"eligible rollover distributions" (as such term is defined under Section 402
of the Code) or (ii) shall be amended as soon as practicable following the
Closing Date to provide for the receipt from the Company Employees of
eligible rollover distributions. Each Company Employee who is a
participant in a tax-qualified defined contribution plan maintained by Parent
or an Affiliate of Parent (a " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") shall be given the
opportunity to receive a distribution of his or her account balance and shall
be given the opportunity to elect to "roll over" such account balance to the
tax-qualified defined contribution plan maintained by Buyer or Affiliate of
Buyer (a " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ "), subject to and in accordance with the
terms of the respective plans and applicable Law. A Company Employee
who elects to make such transfer may also transfer any loan balance she/he
has with Sellers 401(k) Plan to Buyers 401(k) Plan provided that Buyers
401(k) Plan will accept such a transfer only if the Company Employee or
Sellers 401(k) Plan also transfers to Buyers 401(k) Plan the promissory
note evidencing such loan balance and the repayment schedule for same.

  



  

(g) _COBRA_. Effective for qualifying events occurring after the Closing
Date, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall assume all obligations with
respect to the provision of notices, election periods and benefits pursuant
to Section 4980B of the Code or Part VI of Subtitle B of ERISA (" _COBRA_ ")
to all Company Employees (and their beneficiaries).  Similarly, Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer shall assume such obligations which respect to the Company
Employees (and their beneficiaries) who, as of the Closing Date, are entitled
to receive or entitled to elect to receive continuation of group health plan
coverage under COBRA with respect to group health plans which are not non-
Business Plans.  Any COBRA obligations which arise for qualifying events on
or before the Closing Date under non-Business Plans shall remain an
obligation of Seller. If any COBRA obligation relates to qualifying events
after the Closing Date under a non-Business Plan, coverage under which is
continued under the Transition Services Agreement, responsibility shall be
allocated under the terms of the Transition Services Agreement.

  



  

6.6 _Confidential_ _ity_. Except as required by applicable Law, after the
Closing, Parent, Seller and each of their Affiliates shall hold in confidence
all trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary documents and
information related to the Companies and the Subsidiaries business, and
shall refrain from disclosing or using any such confidential information
other than for the benefit of the Companies or the Subsidiaries.
This obligation of confidentiality and non-use shall not apply, or shall
cease to apply, to such information which is publicly available as of the
Closing Date or subsequently becomes publicly available through a source
other than Parent, Seller or any of their Affiliates.

  



  

34      
   



  

6.7 _Notification of Certai_ _n Matters_. The Companies, Seller, Parent or
Buyer, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the others of (a) its
obtaining of knowledge as to the matters set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) below, or (b) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which
occurrence or failure to occur would be likely to cause (i) any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof to the
Closing Date, (ii) any material failure of the Companies, Seller, Parent or
Buyer, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement or
(iii) the institution of any claim, suit, action or proceeding arising out of
or related to the Acquisition or the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations or warranties of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties hereunder.

  



  

6.8 _Noncompetiti_ _on_. Prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date,
the Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, own, manage, operate, control, participate or have any interest
in any Person that (i) produces, manufactures, supplies, sells or distributes
wire, cable or connectivity devices for voice, data or telecommunications
networks (whether public or private) and devices, or (ii) designs, plans,
constructs or installs telecommunications systems; _provided_  that this
Section 6.8 shall not prevent the Seller or its Affiliates from owning,
solely as an investment, securities of a publicly traded company so long as
the Seller and its Affiliates do not own or control, in the aggregate, more
than 10% of any class of securities of such company; and _provided further_ ,
that this Section 6.8 shall not apply to, and no breach shall occur as a
result of, the continued conduct of Parents NOMA business in a manner that
does not materially compete with the business of the Acquired Companies of
Buyer and its other Affiliates.

  



  

6.9 _Nonso_ _licitation_.  Parent and Seller agree that during the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date which is two (2) years
after the Closing Date (the " _Term_ "), neither Parent nor Seller will,
directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or other services or hire any
Person who is or was an employee of the Companies or the Subsidiaries at any
time during the six-month period immediately preceding the Closing or during
the Term, except on behalf of the Companies or the Subsidiaries or Buyer;
provided that this Section 6.9 shall not apply to any such employee whose
employment is terminated by the Buyer or one of its Affiliates on or after
the Closing.

  



  

6.10 _Litigation S_ _upport_. In the event and for so long as Parent, Seller,
Buyer, the Companies or any Subsidiary is actively contesting or defending
against any litigation in connection with any fact, situation, circumstance,
status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident,
action, failure to act or transaction existing or occurring on or prior to
the Closing Date involving the Companies or any Subsidiary, Buyer, on the one
hand, and Parent or Seller, on the other hand, will provide such reasonable
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by the other party, all at the
sole cost and expense of the requesting party (unless in the good
faith belief of the non-requesting party such cooperation will conflict with
the business interests of such non-requesting party or shall materially
interfere with the normal operations of the business of the non-requesting
party).

  



  

6.11 _Books and Recor_ _ds; Access_. After the Closing Date, Parent and
Seller will afford to Buyer and Buyers Representatives, during normal
business hours, upon reasonable request,

  



  

35      
   



  

reasonable access to the books and records of Parent and Seller pertaining to
each of the Companies and the Subsidiaries (unless in the good faith belief
of Parent such access will conflict with the business interests of Parent or
any of its subsidiaries or shall materially interfere with the normal
operations of the business of Parent or its subsidiaries).
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision in this Agreement,
neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall have the right to receive
or obtain any information relating to Taxes or Returns of the Parent, Seller,
any of their Affiliates, or any of their predecessors other than information
relating solely to any of its Companies and the Subsidiaries. After the
Closing Date, Buyer will cause the Companies to hold all of the books
and records of each of the Companies and the Subsidiaries existing on the
Closing Date in accordance with Buyers retention policies in effect from
time to time (and applied to Buyers representations generally) for a period
of not less than two years from the Closing Date and, if it thereafter
proposes to destroy or dispose of any such books and records, to offer first
in writing at least 60 days prior to such proposed destruction or disposition
to surrender them to Parent or Seller at the sole expense of Parent and
Seller. After the Closing Date, Buyer will cause each of the Companies and
the Subsidiaries to afford Parent and Seller and their accountants and
counsel, during normal business hours, upon reasonable request, reasonable
access to the books and records of each of the Companies and the Subsidiaries
(unless in the good faith belief of Buyer such access will conflict with the
business interests of Buyer or any of its subsidiaries or shall materially
interfere with the normal operations of the business operations of the
business of Buyer or its subsidiaries).  Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision in this Agreement, neither the Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall have the right to receive or obtain any information relating
to Taxes or Returns of the Buyer, Seller, any of their Affiliates, or any of
their predecessors other than information relating solely to any of its
Companies and the Subsidiaries.

  



  

6.12 _Assignment of Confi_ _dentiality Agreements_. Effective upon the
Closing, Parent and Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to assign
to the Companies all of Parent and Sellers right, title and interest in and
to any material confidentiality agreements that Parent or Seller are a party
to and which are currently in effect pertaining to the confidentiality of
information pertaining to the Companies, the hiring of employees of the
Companies or other matters.

  



  

6.13 _Intercompany C_ _ontracts_. Except as contemplated in the
Transition Services Agreement (or as set forth in Schedule 1.3(b)(ii)), all
contracts and arrangements between the Companies and the Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and Parent and Seller or any of their subsidiaries (other than the
Acquired Companies), on the other hand, will be terminated as of the Closing
Date, at no liability to the Companies or the Subsidiaries.

  



  

6.14 _Audited Financia_ _l Statements_. From and after the date of this
Agreement, Parent and Seller will afford to Buyer and Buyers Representatives
reasonable access at all reasonable times and upon reasonable notice to the
books and records and other information regarding the Companies and the
Subsidiaries, including the work papers of Deloitte and Touche LLP, Parents
independent auditors, for the purpose of preparing audited financial
statements of the Acquired Companies. Parent and Seller shall cooperate with
Buyer in the preparation of audited financial statements for the Acquired
Companies for the past three fiscal years and any interim periods specified
in the rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, at
Buyers sole

and the Companies);

  



  

40      
   



  

(b) by either Buyer or Parent (on behalf of itself, Seller and the Companies)
if there has been a material breach of any representation or warranty or

within 30 days following the receipt by the breaching party of a notice from

at or prior to the date set forth in Section 8.1(c) below, _provided_ ,

 **Article IX**

  

 **Survival; Indemnification**

  



  

9.1 _Survival of Represe_ _ntations and Warranties and Covenants_.
Notwithstanding any investigation made by or on behalf of any of the parties
hereto or the results of any such investigation and notwithstanding the
participation of such party in the Closing, the representations, warranties
and covenants contained herein shall, except as otherwise provided in the
proviso to this sentence or in the next two sentences of this Section 9.1,
survive the Closing for a period of 18 months from the Closing Date;
_provided_  that any claim by a party for indemnification hereunder prior to
such date that has not been completely and finally resolved prior to such
earlier date shall survive until such time as such claim is resolved,
completely and finally. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.2, 2.3 and the
first and last sentence of 3.2 shall survive for the length of the applicable
statutory period within which to assert a claim with respect thereto. Any
covenant or other agreement herein of any party any portion of the
performance of which may or is specified to occur after the Closing shall
survive the Closing indefinitely or for such lesser period of time as may be
specified therein.

  



  

9.2 _Indemnification b_ _y Parent and Seller_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing, except as provided in Article X, which shall
exclusively govern any claim for indemnification and obligations and
procedures related thereto, in each case, with respect to any Losses related
to Taxes and subject to the notice requirement

  



  

41      
   



  

and limitations of Section 9.2(b) hereof, Parent and Seller agree, jointly
and severally, to indemnify in full (without duplication) Buyer, the
Companies and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") and hold
them harmless from and against any claim, demand, loss, liability,
obligation, deficiency, action, damage, expense or cost (including, without
limitation, interest, penalties, costs of investigation and defense, and
reasonable legal and other professional fees and expenses), whether or not
actually incurred or paid prior to the date referred to in Section 9.2(b) and
whether or not involving a Third Party Action (as defined in Section 9.5
hereof) (collectively " _Losses_ "), which any of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties may suffer, sustain or become subject to, arising from or relating to
(i) any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in or breach of any of
the representations and warranties of Parent or Seller contained in this
Agreement (other than the representations and warranties in Section 3.12)
(including in the Disclosure Schedule or closing certificates delivered or to
be delivered by or on behalf of such party pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement) (collectively, the " _Related Documents_ "), or (ii) any breach
of, or failure to perform, any covenant of the Companies, Parent or Seller
contained in this Agreement (other than covenants in Article X)
(collectively, the " _Buyer Losses_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
recovery shall be available under this Section 9.2(a) on account of any Loss
in respect of which, and to the extent that, a price adjustment was made
under Article II.

  



  

(b) Parent and Seller will be liable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any
Buyer Loss (i) only if Buyer delivers to Seller a written notice, pursuant to
Section 9.4 or 9.5, as applicable, with respect to such Buyer Indemnified
Partys claim to be indemnified for such Buyer Losses prior to 18 months of
the Closing Date, except for claims arising from a breach of or inaccuracy in
the representations and warranties made in Sections 2.2, 2.3 and the first
and last sentence of 3.2 or for claims arising from a breach of a covenant
the performance of which may or is specified to occur after the expiration of
such 18-month period, for which a claim may be brought through the survival
period described in Section 9.1, and (ii) (A) except as provided in the
following clause (B), only if the aggregate amount of all Buyer Losses
exceeds 1% of the Final Closing Purchase Price (the " _Basket Amount_ ")
or (B) solely in respect of Buyer Losses for which Parent and Seller are
liable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties as a result of a breach or inaccuracy
of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.22 hereof
(including, for this purpose, any Buyer Losses related to the sites referred
to in Section 3.22(d) of the Disclosure Schedule in excess of $2,000,000) ("
_Buyer Environmental Losses_ "), only if the aggregate amount of all such
Buyer Environmental Losses exceeds 0.5% of the Final Closing Purchase Price
(the " _Environmental Basket Amount_ "), in which case Parent and Seller
shall be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for the total
amount of all such Buyer Losses or Buyer Environmental Losses, as the case
may be, in excess of the Basket Amount or Environmental Basket Amount, as
applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Basket Amount shall apply only
to breaches of or inaccuracies in representations and warranties other than
those set forth in Sections 2.2, 2.3 and the first and last sentence of 3.2
hereof and shall _not_ apply to any breaches of any covenants of the
Companies or Seller or Parent set forth in this Agreement (except
as otherwise provided in Section 10.1(c)); _provided further_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, (x) any amounts paid by Parent or Seller in excess of the
Environmental Basket Amount in respect to Buyer Environmental Losses shall
not be counted for purposes of determining the aggregate amount of Buyer
Losses to be applied against the Basket Amount, and (y) the Environmental
Basket Amount shall be treated as a subset of the Basket Amount ( _e.g._ , if
the Environmental Basket Amount has been fully applied against Buyer
Environmental Losses, and no other Buyer

  



  

42      
   



  

Losses have been incurred by Buyer, the amount remaining in the Basket Amount
would be equal to 0.5% of the Final Closing Purchase Price). Parents and
Sellers aggregate liability in respect of all matters covered by
this Section 9.2 and Section 10.1(c) shall not exceed an amount equal to 25%
of the Final Closing Purchase Price (such product, the " _Cap_ "); _provided,
however_ , that such Cap shall not be applicable in the event that a final,
non-appealable judgment finds that Parent or Seller committed intentional
fraud in connection with the breach of the representations, warranties or
covenants in question.

  



  

9.3 _Indem_ _nification by Buyer_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to the notice requirement and
limitations of Section 9.3(b) hereof, Buyer agrees to indemnify in full
Parent and Seller and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents
and subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") and
hold them harmless from and against any Losses which any of the Seller
Indemnified Parties may suffer, sustain or become subject to, arising from or
relating to (i) any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in or breach of any of
the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement or
other Related Documents or (ii) any breach of, or failure to perform,
any covenant of Buyer contained in this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Seller Losses_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no recovery shall be
available under this Section 9.3(a) on account of any Loss in respect of
which, and to the extent that, a price adjustment was made under Article II.

  



  

(b) Buyer will be liable to the Seller Indemnified Parties for any Seller
Loss (i) only if Parent delivers to Buyer a written notice, pursuant to
Section 9.4 or 9.5, as applicable, with respect to such Seller Indemnified
Partys claim to be indemnified for such Seller Losses prior to 18 months of
the Closing Date, except for claims arising from a breach of a covenant the
performance of which may or is specified to occur after the expiration of
such 18-month period, for which a claim may be brought through the survival
period described in Section 9.1, and (ii) only if the aggregate amount of all
Seller Losses exceeds the Basket Amount, in which case Buyer shall be
obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties for the total amount of
all such Seller Losses in excess of the Basket Amount; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Basket Amount shall apply only to breaches of or inaccuracies
in representations and warranties and shall _not_  apply to any breaches of
any covenants of Buyer set forth in this Agreement. Buyers aggregate
liability for all amounts under this Section 9.3 shall not exceed an amount
equal to the Cap; _provided, however_ , that such Cap shall not be
applicable in the event that a final, non-appealable judgment finds that
Buyer committed intentional fraud in connection with the breach of the
representations, warranties or covenants in question.

  



  

9.4 _Notice of Cla_ _ims_. Any written notice required to be delivered to the
applicable Indemnifying Party under Section 9.2 or 9.3, as the case may be,
shall specify in reasonable detail (i) the representation and warranty or
covenant that is alleged to have been inaccurate or to have been breached,
(ii) the basis for such allegation and (iii) if known, the aggregate amount
of the Losses for which a claim is being made under this Article IX or, to
the extent that such Losses are not known or have not been incurred at the
time such claim is made, an estimate, to be prepared in good faith, of the
aggregate potential amount of such Losses. To the extent readily available
and the production of which shall not materially interfere with the normal
operations of the business of the Indemnified Party or its subsidiaries, the
Indemnified Party

  



  

43      
   



  

shall supply such documentation as it reasonably believes to be relevant to
such notice. Written notice to such Indemnifying Party of the existence of a
claim shall be given by the Indemnified Party promptly after the Indemnified
Party first receives notice of the potential claim; _provided, however_ , that
the Indemnified Party shall not be foreclosed from seeking indemnification
pursuant to this Article IX by any failure to provide such prompt notice of
the existence of a claim to the applicable Indemnifying Party or to supply
such relevant supporting documentation, except and only to the extent that
such Indemnifying Party has been materially damaged or prejudiced as a result
of such delay.

  



  

9.5 _Method_ _of Asserting Claims_. As used herein, an " _Indemnified Party_ "
shall refer to a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as
applicable, and the " _Indemnifying Party_ " shall refer to the party or
parties hereto obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Party.

  



  

(a) In the event that any Indemnified Party is made a defendant in or party
to any action or proceeding, judicial or administrative, instituted by any
third party for the liability or the costs or expenses of which are Losses
(any such third party action or proceeding being referred to as a "
_Third Party Action_ "), the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party prompt notice thereof. The failure to give such notice
shall not affect any Indemnified Partys ability to seek reimbursement unless
the Indemnifying Party has been materially damaged or prejudiced as a result
of such delay.  The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to contest and
defend such Third Party Action (at its own expense and by its own counsel).
Notice of the intention to so contest and defend shall be given by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party within 20 business days after the
Indemnified Partys notice of such Third Party Action (but, in all events, at
least five business days prior to the date that an answer to such Third Party
Action is due to be filed).

  



  

(b) For so long as no Indemnifying Party elects to compromise or defend
against the Third Party Action, fails to notify the Indemnified Party of its
election to do so, or otherwise abandons the defense of such Third Party
Action, (i) the Indemnified Party may pay (without prejudice of any of its
rights as against any applicable Indemnifying Party), compromise or defend
such Third Party Action (until such defense is assumed by an applicable
Indemnifying Party) and (ii) the costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party
incurred in connection therewith shall be indemnifiable by the applicable
Indemnifying Party or Indemnifying Parties pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in
connection with any Third Party Action in which the Indemnified Party shall
reasonably conclude, based upon the advice of its counsel, that (x) there is
a conflict of interest between an applicable Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party in the conduct of the defense of such Third Party Action or
(y) there are specific defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are
different from or additional to those available to an applicable Indemnifying
Party and which could be materially adverse to such Indemnifying Party, then
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Action. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party to the extent reasonably requested by the Indemnifying
Party in the contest and defense of any Third Party Action, including
providing reasonable access (upon reasonable notice) to the books, records
and employees of the Indemnified Party if relevant to the defense of such
Third Party Action; _provided that_ , such cooperation shall not materially
interfere with the normal operations of the business of the Indemnified
Party.  Neither the Indemnified Party nor the Indemnifying Party may
concede, settle or compromise any Third

  



  

44      
   



  

Party Action without the consent of any other party that has any monetary
liability with respect to such claim or any other Indemnified Party that is a
party to such claim, which consents will not be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

(c) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against the
Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party Action, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver a notice of such claim to the Indemnifying
Party and, if the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with respect to
such claim, an officer of Parent and an officer of Buyer will first proceed
in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute. If such dispute is
not resolved through the negotiations of such individuals within 30 days
after the delivery of the Indemnified Partys notice of such claim, the
Indemnified Party may pursue legal action to satisfy its claim (subject to
Section 11.12 hereof).

  



  

9.6 _Ind_ _emnity Payments_.  All indemnity payments owed under this Article
IX or Article X shall be reduced to reflect (i) any Tax Benefits, net of any
Tax Detriments, realized by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
and (ii) any insurance recovery made by the Indemnified Party, in either
case, with respect to the Loss subject to indemnification.

  



  

9.7 _Sole and Exclu_ _sive Remedy_. After the Closing, the rights set forth
in this Article IX and X shall be each partys sole and exclusive remedies
against the other parties hereto for any Buyer Losses or Seller Losses, as
the case may be, or any other Losses sustained, incurred or arising from or
related to this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent any of the
parties hereto from bringing an action based upon allegations of intentional
fraud on the part of one or more of the other parties hereto in connection
with this Agreement or the other Related Documents.

  



  

 **Article X**

  

 **Allocation of Taxes; Tax Returns**

  



  

10.1 _Tax Re_ _turns; Allocation of Tax Liabilities_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall timely prepare and file, or cause to be timely prepared and
filed, in accordance with past practices (unless otherwise required by
applicable law), all Returns of the Acquired Companies for all taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date, provide copies (subject to the
limitations of Section 6.11) thereof to Buyer and timely pay (subject to the
limitations of Section 10.1(c)), or cause to be paid, when due, all Taxes
relating to such Returns. Buyer shall timely prepare and file, or cause to be
timely prepared and filed, all Returns of the Acquired Companies for all
taxable periods ending after the Closing Date, including all
Straddle Periods, and timely pay (subject to the limitations of Section
10.1(c)), or cause to be paid, when due, all Taxes relating to such Returns.
All Returns relating to a Straddle Period shall be prepared and all elections
with respect to such Returns shall be made, to the extent permitted by law,
in a manner consistent with prior practice. Buyer shall provide, or cause to
be provided, to Parent, for its review, a substantially final draft of each
Return relating to a Straddle Period and a schedule setting forth, in
reasonable detail, the calculation of Parents share of any Tax liability
(determined in accordance with Section 10.1(j)) relating to such period at
least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such Return. Parent
shall notify Buyer of any reasonable objections it may have to any items set
forth in such draft Return and Buyer and Parent agree to

  



  

45      
   



  

consult and resolve in good faith any such objection and to mutually consent
to the filing of such Return. If Buyer and Parent are unable to resolve any
such objection, the parties shall submit such objection to the Reviewing
Party for review and resolution based upon procedures consistent with the
procedures described in Section 1.4(b) but with appropriate changes to enable
the filing of the relevant Returns on its due date.

  



  

(b) Within 120 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Acquired
Companies to prepare and provide to Parent, and Parent shall reimburse Buyer
for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses related to the preparation thereof,
a package of Tax information materials, including schedules and work papers
(the " _Tax Package_ ") reasonably required by Parent or its Affiliates to
enable Parent or its Affiliates to prepare all Returns required to be
prepared and filed by Parent pursuant to Section 10.1(a) or any U.S. federal
or state consolidated, combined, unitary or affiliated Return. The Tax
Package shall be prepared in good faith and in a manner consistent with past
practice of the Acquired Companies.

  



  

(c) Subject to the Basket Amount and Cap limits provided for in Section
9.2(b), Parent and Seller shall be jointly and severally liable for all Taxes
attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period which were not properly accrued or
reserved for on the Latest Balance Sheet (as such accrual or reserve may be
modified, consistent with past practices, for subsequent events through
Closing), and shall indemnify Buyer and the Acquired Companies and hold them
harmless from and against any liability for such Taxes; _provided, however_
, that Parent and Seller shall not be liable for and shall not indemnify
Buyer or the Acquired Companies for any Taxes resulting from transactions or
actions taken or deemed to be taken by any of the Acquired Companies on the
Closing Date after the Closing except for transactions or actions undertaken
in the ordinary course of business or otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement. Buyer shall be liable for all Taxes attributable to a Post-Closing
Tax Period and shall indemnify Parent and Seller and hold them harmless from
and against any liability for such Taxes. No amount in excess of the Basket
Amount shall be payable under this Section 10.1(c) until the aggregate amount
of all such excess unpaid indemnity payments exceeds $50,000, in which case,
the indemnifying party thereafter shall be liable to pay all such
excess amounts. Parent will pay all U.S. federal, state and local Taxes
attributable to the making of any Election.

  



  

(d) Buyer and its Affiliates shall not, and shall not allow any of the
Acquired Companies to, make any election, change any tax accounting method or
convention or take any position on any Return with respect to any taxable
period ending after the Closing Date (including an amendment to any such
Return) that would adversely affect the Tax liability of Parent or Seller
without the prior written consent of Parent. In addition, Buyer and
its Affiliates, shall not (and shall not cause or permit any of the
Acquired Companies to) amend, refile or otherwise modify any Return relating
in whole or in part to any of the Acquired Companies with respect to any Pre-
Closing Period without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. In those jurisdictions where no Election
is made or deemed made, Parent and Seller shall not, and shall not allow any
of their Affiliates to, make any election, change any tax accounting method
or convention, amend, refile or otherwise modify any Return or take any
position on any Return with respect to any Pre-Closing Period (including an
amendment to any such Return) that would adversely affect the Tax liability
of Buyer and its Affiliates or any of the Acquired Companies without the
prior written consent of Buyer, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld.

  



  

46      
   



  

(e) The amount of any Tax refund (including any interest in respect thereof)
received by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies), and any amounts credited against Tax to which Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) become entitled (including by
way of any amended Returns), that relate to any Pre-Closing Period shall be
paid over to Parent within five business days after receipt thereof or upon
receipt of a credit therefor, but only to the extent such refund exceeds any
Tax refund reflected on the Latest Balance Sheet. Any refunds of Taxes or any
amounts credited against Taxes with respect to a Straddle Period shall be
apportioned between Buyer and Parent in the same manner as the liability for
such Taxes is apportioned. Upon the request of Parent, Buyer shall prepare
and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, and Parent shall reimburse Buyer
for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses related to the preparation
thereof, all carryback claims and claims for refunds relating to Taxes for
any pre-Closing Tax Period.

  



  

(f) If the examination of any U.S. federal, state, local or other Return of
Parent, Seller, any of their Affiliates, or any of the Acquired Companies for
any Pre-Closing Period shall result (by settlement or otherwise) in any
adjustment that permits Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) to increase deductions, losses or Tax credits or decrease
the income, gains or recapture of Tax credits that would otherwise (but for
such adjustments) have been reported or taken into account (including by way
of any increase in basis) by Buyer, any of its Affiliates, or any of the
Acquired Companies for one or more periods ending after the Closing Date,
Parent will notify Buyer and provide it with adequate information so that
Buyer can reflect on its, its Affiliates, or the Acquired Companies Returns
such increases in deductions, losses or Tax credits or decreases in income,
gains or recapture of Tax credits. The Buyer shall pay to Parent within 30
days of the receipt of such information, the amount of any resulting Tax
Benefits.

  



  

(g) If the examination of any U.S. federal, state, local or other Return of
Buyer or any of Buyers Affiliates, or any of the Acquired Companies for any
Post-Closing Period shall result (by settlement or otherwise) in any
adjustment that permits Parent, Seller or any of its Affiliates to increase
deductions, losses or Tax credits or decrease the income, gains or recapture
of Tax credits that would otherwise (but for such adjustments) have been
reported or taken into account (including by way of any increase in basis) by
Parent, Seller, or any of their Affiliates for one or more periods ending on
or before the Closing Date, Buyer will notify Parent and provide it with
adequate information so that Parent, Seller, or any of their Affiliates can
reflect on its Returns such increases in deductions, losses or Tax credits or
decreases in income, gains or recapture of Tax credits. Parent shall pay to
Buyer within 30 days of the receipt of such information, the amount of any
resulting Tax Benefits.

  



  

(h) " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ " means any Tax period beginning after the
Closing Date; and, with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax
period beginning after the Closing Date.

  



  

(i) " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ " means any Tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date; and, with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax
period ending on the Closing Date.

  



  

47      
   



  

(j) The parties hereto shall, to the extent permitted under applicable law,
treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period of each
of the Acquired Companies for all Tax Purposes. In any case where applicable
law does not permit the Closing Date to be treated as the last day of the
taxable year or period, any Taxes (including Taxes based upon or related to
income and any gross receipts, sales or use Tax) of any Acquired
Company attributable to a Tax period which begins before and ends after the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") shall be apportioned between the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period based on the actual
operations and transactions of such Acquired Company during the portion of
such period ending on the Closing Date, and the portion of such period
beginning after the Closing Date, respectively, calculated as though the
taxable year of the Acquired Company terminated at the close of business on
the Closing Date, except that (i) real property, personal
property, intangibles and other similar Taxes and (ii) exemptions, allowances
or deductions that are allocated and allowed on an annual basis shall
be apportioned on a per diem basis.

  



  

(k) " _Tax Benefits_ " realized means the sum of any increased deductions,
losses, or credits in future years or decreases in income, gains or recapture
of credits then allowable (including by way of amended Returns), or based on
reasonable estimates, allowable in future years, multiplied by 39%, and
reduced, by applying a discount rate equal to 115% of the applicable federal
rate, as determined under Section 1274(d) of the Code for the appropriate
time period, from the close of the earliest year in which such increased
deductions, losses or credits or such decreases in income, gains or recapture
of credits would possibly be available.

  



  

(l) " _Tax Detriments_ " realized means the sum of any decreased deductions,
losses, or credits in future years or increases in income, gains or recapture
of credits then allowable (including by way of amended Returns), or based on
reasonable estimates, allowable in future years, multiplied by 39%, and
reduced, by applying a discount rate equal to 115% of the applicable federal
rate, as determined under Section 1274(d) of the Code for the appropriate
period, from the close of the earliest year in which such decreased
deductions, losses or credits or such increases in income, gains or recapture
of credits would possibly be available.

  



  

10.2 _Coope_ _ration_.

  



  

(a) Parent and Buyer shall endeavor in good faith to agree on an allocation
of the Purchase Price between the Shares of each of the Companies and the
Related IP prior to the Closing Date, to be evidenced in a schedule signed
and dated by Parent and Buyer, and Parent and Buyer shall (i) be bound by any
such allocation for purposes of determining any Taxes, (ii) prepare and file
their Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such allocation, and (iii) take
no position inconsistent with such allocation on any applicable Tax Return,
in any proceeding before any taxing authority or otherwise. In the event
that any of the allocations are disputed by any taxing authority, the party
receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other
party concerning resolution of the dispute.

  



  

(b) Parent, Seller, the Acquired Companies and Buyer shall cooperate fully,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection
with the preparation and filing of Returns pursuant to Section 10.1 and any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.
Such cooperation shall include signing any Returns, amended Returns, claims
or other documents necessary to settle any Tax controversy, the retention and
(upon the other

  



  

48      
   



  

partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

  



  

(c) Whenever any taxing authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment, or
otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes of any Acquired Company for a Pre-
Closing Period, Buyer shall promptly inform Parent, and Parent shall have the
right to control any resulting proceedings and to determine whether and when
to settle or otherwise dispose of any such claim, assessment or dispute to
the extent such proceedings or determinations may affect the amount of Taxes
for which Parent or Seller may be liable under this Agreement.  Whenever any
taxing authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment or otherwise disputes
the amount of Taxes for a Post-Closing Period, Buyer shall have the right to
control any resulting proceedings and to determine whether and when to settle
any such claim, assessment or dispute to the extent such proceedings or
determinations affect the amount of Taxes for which Buyer may be liable under
this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever any taxing authority
asserts a claim, makes an assessment or otherwise disputes the amount of
Taxes for a Straddle Period, then the party who is reasonably expected to be
liable for the larger amount of such Tax under this Agreement shall have the
right to control any resulting proceedings; provided, however, that (i) no
settlement of such claim, assessment, or dispute will be entered into without
the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (ii) such other party shall have the
right to participate in any such proceedings and retain separate counsel of
its choice for such purpose, at its sole cost and expense.

  



  

(d) Parent, Seller, Buyer and the Acquired Companies agree, upon request from
the other party, to use their commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Governmental Entity or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).

  



  

(e) Parent and Seller shall consult with Buyer prior to taking any action to
eliminate the balances in the Intercompany Accounts pursuant to Section
1.3(b)(ii) of this Agreement.

  



  

10.3 _Transfer T_ _axes_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Buyer, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall each
pay and be responsible for fifty (50%) of all transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any real property
transfer tax and any similar Tax). Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Article X, any Returns that must be filed in connection with such Taxes
shall be prepared and timely filed by the party primarily or customarily
responsible under the applicable local Law for filing such Returns, and such
party shall provide to the other party a true copy of each such Return as
filed and evidence of the timely filing thereof.

  



  

49      
   



  

10.4 _Section 3_ _38(h)(10) Election_.

  



  

(a) Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall make an election under
Section 338(g) of the Code (or any similar provision of the Law of any state
or other taxing jurisdiction) with respect to any of the Acquired Companies
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
the prior written consent of Parent.

  



  

(b) With respect to the sale and acquisition of each of the Companies, Krone
Optical Systems, Inc, Krone Holding Inc, Krone USA Incorporated, and Krone
Incorporated (collectively, the " _Eligible Companies_ "), Parent and Buyer,
and their respective Affiliates, hereby covenant and agree with each other
that they will join in making an election pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (a " _Section
338(h)(10) Election_ ") and (i) at least 10 days prior to the Closing Date,
Parent and Buyer shall agree based on information then available on the form
and content of the IRS Forms 8023 (the " _Forms 8023_ ") on which the
Section 338(h)(10) Elections shall be made; (ii) at or prior to the Closing,
Buyer shall deliver to Parent properly executed Forms 8023
containing information then available, which Parent shall file with the
Internal Revenue Service not later than five days following the Closing Date;
(iii) Seller and Buyer shall jointly and timely make any elections under
state or local tax law comparable to the Section 338(h)(10) Elections (each
such election, a " _Comparable Election_ ", and collectively with any Section
338(h)(10) Election, an " _Election_ ") with respect to the Eligible
Companies; (iv) Parent and Buyer shall, as promptly as practicable following
the Closing Date, cooperate with each other to take all other actions
necessary and appropriate (including filing such forms, returns, elections,
schedules and other documents as may be required) otherwise to effect,
perfect and preserve timely Elections in accordance with the provisions of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-l (or any comparable provisions of
state or local tax law) or any successor provisions; and (v) Parent and
Buyer, and their respective Affiliates, shall report the sale
and acquisition, respectively, of the stock of the Eligible Companies
pursuant to this Agreement consistent with the Elections and shall take no
position to the contrary thereto in any Return, or in any proceeding before
any taxing authority or otherwise.

  



  

(c) To the extent permissible or required by law, Parent and Buyer, and their
respective Affiliates, shall cooperate in the preparation and timely filing
of (i) any corrections, amendments or supplements to the Forms 8023 and (ii)
any state or local forms or reports, in each case, that are necessary or
appropriate for purposes of complying with the requirements for making any
Election. To the extent necessary for the valid filing of any such
corrections, amendments, supplements, forms or reports, Parent and Buyer, and
their respective Affiliates, shall cooperate in the timely execution thereof.

  



  

(d) None of Parent, Seller, or Buyer shall, or shall permit any of their
Affiliates to, take any action to modify any of the forms or reports
(including any corrections, amendments or supplements thereto) that are
required for the making of the Elections after their execution or to modify
or revoke any of the Elections following the filing of the Forms 8023 without
the written consent of Parent, Seller or Buyer, as the case may be.

  



  

(e) Buyer will initially prepare a complete set of IRS Forms 8883 (and any
comparable forms required to be filed under state, local or foreign Tax Law)
and any additional data or materials required to be attached to Form 8883
pursuant to the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 338 of the
Code (" _Asset Allocation Statements_ "). Buyer will deliver

  



  

50      
   



  

the Asset Allocation Statements to Parent for review no later than 60 days
prior to the date on which such forms are required to be filed. In the event
Parent reasonably objects to the manner in which the Asset
Allocation Statements have been prepared, Parent will notify Buyer within 15
days of receipt of the Asset Allocation Statements of such objection, and the
parties will endeavor within the next 15 days to resolve such dispute in
good faith. If the parties are unable to resolve such dispute within such
15-day period, Parent and Buyer will submit such dispute to an independent
accounting firm of recognized national standing (the " _Allocation Arbiter_
") selected jointly by Parent and Buyer, which firm will not be the
regular accounting firm of Parent or Buyer, and which firm shall resolve such
dispute in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 1.4(b). The
Allocation Arbiters Asset Allocation Statements will be conclusive and
binding upon the parties.

  



  

10.5 _Survival_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, each of the provisions set forth in this Article X shall survive
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, as such
statute may be extended, for the applicable Taxes or Return to which the
provision relates.

 **Miscellaneous**

  



  

11.1 _Press Releas_ _es and Announcements_. Except as otherwise required by
Law or the rules of any applicable securities exchange or NASDAQ, so long as

representatives to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or
make any other public announcement (including without limitation,
announcements to employees of the Companies and the Subsidiaries) with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.  Buyer and Parent will cooperate with each other in the
development and distribution of all press releases and other public

contemplated hereby, and will furnish the other with drafts of any such
releases and announcements as far in advance as possible.

connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, including without
limitation legal, accounting, investment banking and consulting fees and
