 Section 2.3 _Company Boards of Directors and Committees; Section 14(f) of Exchange Act_. 

  

 (a) _Composition of Company Board_. Effective upon the initial acceptance for payment by Merger Sub of Company Shares pursuant to the Offer (the " _Appointment Time_ ," the use of which term herein shall not, unless the context otherwise requires, depend upon whether Parent shall exercise its rights under this _Section 2.3(a)_) and from time to time thereafter up to the Effective Time, subject to _Section 2.3(b)_, Parent shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors on the Company Board equal to the product (rounded up to the next whole number) obtained by multiplying (x) the number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this _Section 2.3_) and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Company Shares held by Parent and Merger Sub (giving effect to the Company Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer), and the denominator of which is the total number of then outstanding Company Shares. Promptly following a request by Parent, the Company shall take all action necessary to cause the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to the Company Board, including either by increasing the size of the Company Board or by seeking and accepting or otherwise securing the resignations of such number of then incumbent directors as is necessary to enable the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to the Company Board. From time to time after the Appointment Time, subject to  _Section 2.3(b)_, the Company shall take all action 

      ##### 

  

    

necessary to cause the individuals so designated by Parent to constitute
substantially the same percentage (rounding up where appropriate) as is on
the Company Board on (i) each committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board
of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company and (iii) each committee of
each such board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company, in each case
to the fullest extent permitted by all applicable Law. Solely for purposes of
this _Section 2.3_, any and all members of the Company Board immediately
prior to such appointments by Parent who remain on the Company Board after
such appointments by Parent shall be referred to as " _Continuing Directors_
" and each as a " _Continuing Director_." In the event that Parents
designees are elected or designated to the Company Board pursuant to this
_Section 2.3(a)_ , then, until the Effective Time, the Company Board shall
always have at least three (3) Continuing Directors. If the number of
directors who are Continuing Directors is reduced below three (3) prior to
the Effective Time, the remaining Continuing Directors shall be entitled
to designate an individual to fill such vacancy who is not a current or
former officer, director, employee or consultant of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (a " _Parent Insider_ ") and who shall be deemed a Continuing
Director for all purposes of this Agreement, and the Company shall cause such
designee to be appointed to the Company Board. If, notwithstanding compliance
with the foregoing provisions, the number of Continuing Directors is reduced
to zero (0), then the other directors on the Company Board shall designate
and appoint to the Company Board three (3) directors who are not Parent
Insiders who shall be deemed Continuing Directors for all purposes of
this Agreement. 

   

 (b) _Continued Listing_. In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_, and without limiting _Section 2.3(a)_ , until the Effective Time, the Company Board shall have at least such number of directors as may be required by the rules of the Nasdaq or the federal securities Laws who are considered independent directors within the meaning of such Laws (" _Independent Directors_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that after and subject to payment by Merger Sub for the Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, the Company shall, upon Parents request, take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a "Controlled Company" for purposes of Listing Rule 5615(c) of the Nasdaq rules (or any successor provision) and make all necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below the number of directors as may be required by such Laws for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to designate persons to fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no other Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall designate such number of directors as may be required by the rules of the Nasdaq or the federal securities Laws, to fill such vacancies who shall not be shareholders or Affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub, and such Persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. __ 

   

 (c) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Companys obligation to appoint Parents designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all action required pursuant to this  _Section 2.3_ and Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this  _Section 2.3_, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its directors and officers as is required under 

      ##### 

  

    

such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under
this  _Section 2.3_. Parent shall, promptly after the date hereof and a
reasonable period prior to the commencement of the Offer, provide to the
Company in writing, and be solely responsible for any information with
respect to itself and its nominees, directors, officers and Affiliates,
required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. 

   

 (d) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the Company Board prior to the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ hereof, the approval of a majority of such Continuing Directors (or the sole Continuing Director if there shall be only one (1) Continuing Director) shall be required in order to (i) amend, modify or terminate this Agreement, or agree or consent to any amendment, modification or termination of this Agreement, in any case on behalf of the Company, (ii) extend the time for performance of, or waive, any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement, (iii) exercise or waive any of the Companys rights, conditions, benefits or remedies under this Agreement, (iv) except as provided herein, amend or otherwise modify the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (v) authorize or execute any Contract, or any amendment or modification of any Contract, between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates on the other hand, or the termination of any such Agreement then in effect by the Company or any such Subsidiary or (vi) make any other determination or give any approval or authorization that is required to be taken or given by the Company Board with respect to any action to be taken or not to be taken by or on behalf of the Company relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger. Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ and prior to the Effective Time, any actions with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement by the Company shall be effected only by and at the direction of a majority of the Continuing Directors (or the action of the sole Continuing Director if there shall only be one Continuing Director then in office), and any such authorization or direction shall constitute the authorization and direction of the full Company Board with respect thereto, and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize, or for the Company to take, any such action. 

   

 Section 2.4 _The Top-Up Option_. 

  

 (a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this  _Section 2.4_, to purchase that number of Company Shares (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of Company Shares that, when added to the number of Company Shares held by Parent and Merger Sub at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the total Company Shares then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis, which means the number of Company Shares then outstanding, together with all Company Shares that the Company would be required to issue pursuant to the conversion or exercise of options, rights and securities that are then convertible into or exercisable for Company Shares, including after giving effect to Section 

      ##### 

  

    

7.11), assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Shares (such number, the " _Short-
Form Threshold_ "), at a price per Company Share equal to the Offer Price. 

   

 (b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable once in whole and not in part on or prior to the fifth Business Day after the later of Parents or Merger Subs acceptance for payment of Company Shares pursuant to the Offer or, if Merger Sub elects to extend the Offer for a subsequent offering period pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_, the expiration of any subsequent offering period under  _Section 2.1(e)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of Company Shares in excess of the number of authorized but unissued Company Shares (including as authorized and unissued Company Shares, for purposes of this  _Section 2.4_, any Company Shares held in the treasury of the Company) and (ii) the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless immediately after such exercise and the issuance of the Top-Up Shares pursuant thereto, the Short-Form Threshold would be reached; and _provided_   _further_ , that the Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

   

 (c) In the event Merger Sub exercises the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall so notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth in such notice (i) the number of Company Shares that will be owned by Parent and Merger Sub immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, (ii) the number of Company shares that Merger Sub intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option and (iii) the place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver notice to Parent and Merger Sub in writing confirming the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefor. At the Top-Up Closing, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares. Such aggregate price may be paid by Merger Sub, at its election, either (A) entirely in cash or (B) in cash in an amount equal to the aggregate par value of the purchased Top-Up Option Shares and by executing and delivering to the Company a full recourse unsecured promissory note issued by Merger Sub having a principal amount equal to the remainder of such aggregate purchase price (which promissory note either shall be a demand note or shall have a stated maturity date of not more than three (3) months from the date of issue). Any such promissory note shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the prime lending rate prevailing during the period in which any portion of the principal amount of such promissory note remains outstanding, as published by _The Wall Street Journal_ , calculated on a daily basis on the outstanding principal amount of such promissory note from the date such promissory note is originally issued until the date of payment in full of such promissory note, and may be prepaid without premium or penalty. The Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares, which certificate may include any legends required by applicable securities laws (or, if the Company does not then issue Company Shares in certificated form, the applicable number of Company Shares in non-certificated book-entry form). 

   

 (d) Parent and Merger Sub understand that the Company Shares which Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon Section 4(2) of the Securities Act 

     ##### 

 

  

and/or Rule 506 promulgated thereunder. Parent and Merger Sub represent and
warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, or will be upon the purchase
of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501
of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. Purchaser agrees that
the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares are being and will be acquired
by Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for
resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of
the Securities Act.

the Company or such Subsidiary containing customary
confidentiality obligations and under which all Intellectual Property Rights

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are subject to any judgment, order, writ, assessment, decision, injunction, decree or ruling of a Governmental Entity that restricts or impairs the use of any Owned Company IP or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any Licensed Company IP, other than restrictions or impairments that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (i) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) will not result in (i) the Company or its Subsidiaries granting to any third party any rights or licenses to any material Owned Company IP or Licensed Company IP that is exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any right of termination or cancellation of the licensor under any Contract for the license of any material Licensed Company IP or any modification to any of the rights and obligations of either party under any Contract for the license of any material Licensed Company IP, (iii) the imposition of

deposit into escrow or otherwise make conditionally available any Company
Source Code to any other Person other than the customers identified in
Section 4.18(l)(1) of the Company Disclosure Letter and customers (i) that
have been granted the right in the ordinary course of business to require the

beneficiary under any source code escrow arrangement under which the Company

 (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) otherwise complying with, the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (iii) otherwise disclosing any information to the Company Stockholders (including any factually accurate public statement by the Company that describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of the Agreement with respect thereto) if the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law or a violation of any other applicable Law; _provided_ that, in no event shall this Section 7.2(d) affect the obligations of the Company under Sections 7.1 and 7.2 hereof; and _provided, further, however_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop-look-and listen communication" pursuant to the provisions of Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act to the Company Stockholders) will be deemed a Company Board Recommendation Change unless such disclosure includes a reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation.

 (e) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement, which would restrict the Companys ability to comply with any of the terms of this _Section 7.2,_ with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement and until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 7.3 _Company Stockholders  Meeting; Short-Form Merger_. 

   

 (a) If the Short-Form Threshold is not met and adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company is required under Delaware Law in order to consummate the Merger other than pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL, the Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the stockholders of the Company (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") as promptly as practicable following the Appointment Time for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law. Nothing herein shall prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholders Meeting if there are insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock necessary to conduct business at the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to secure the Requisite Stockholder Vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article IX_ hereof, the Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law, whether or not the Company Board at any time subsequent to the date hereof shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change or otherwise shall determine that this Agreement is no longer advisable or recommends that the Company Stockholders reject it. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Companys obligation to establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this  _Section 7.3(a)_ shall not be limited to, or otherwise affected by, the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal, but it shall be subject to the prior occurrence of the Appointment Time. 

   

 (b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall vote all Company Shares acquired in the Offer (or otherwise beneficially owned by it or any of its respective Subsidiaries as of the applicable record date) in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law at the Company Stockholders Meeting or otherwise. Parent shall vote all of the shares of capital stock of Merger Sub beneficially owned by it, or sign a written consent in lieu of a meeting of the stockholders of Merger Sub, in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 7.2_ hereof or this _Section 7.3_, in the event that Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent, shall have acquired Company Shares equal to or greater than the Short-Form Threshold, pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as 

      ##### 

  

    

practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of the stockholders of
the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL. 

  

 Section 7.4 _Proxy Statement_. 

   

 (a) In connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting, if any, as soon as practicable following the Appointment Time, the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare, and the Company shall file with the SEC, the Proxy Statement for use in connection with the solicitation of proxies from the Company Stockholders in connection with the Merger and the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, shall furnish all information concerning the Company, Parent and Merger Sub as the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, may reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement. Subject to all applicable Law, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement shall be made by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. The Company shall advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC or its staff for an amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, or comments thereon and responses thereto, or requests by the SEC or its staff for additional information in connection therewith. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective directors, officers or Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement describing such information shall be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of Nasdaq. For purposes of this Agreement, the letter to stockholders, notice of meeting, proxy statement and form of proxy and any other soliciting material, or the information statement, as the case may be, to be distributed to stockholders in connection with the Merger (including any amendments or supplements) and any schedules required to be filed with the SEC in connection therewith are collectively referred to as the " _Proxy Statement_." 

   

 (b) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article IX_ hereof, subject to the terms of _Section 7.2(b)_ hereof, the Company shall include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation (other than with respect to the Offer).

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section 7.5(a)_ hereof, (i) as soon as may be reasonably practicable following the Agreement Date, and in any event within ten Business Days after the date hereof, each of Parent and the Company shall file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) as required by the HSR Act and (ii) as soon as may be reasonably practicable following the Agreement Date, each of Parent and the Company shall file comparable pre-merger notification filings, forms and submissions with any foreign Governmental Entity that may be required by any Foreign Antitrust Laws or reasonably be deemed desirable by Parent, in each case as Parent may reasonably deem necessary and/or appropriate. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly (i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of such filings, (ii) supply the other with any information that may be required in order to effectuate such filings and (iii) supply any additional information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction and that Parent reasonably deems necessary and/or appropriate. Each party hereto shall 

      ##### 

  

    

promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger). If any
party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional
information or documentary material from any such Governmental Entity with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Offer and the Merger), then such party shall use reasonable best efforts to
make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance
with such request. The Company shall not extend, directly or indirectly, any
waiting periods required in connection with the HSR Act or Foreign Antitrust
Laws, or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity to delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby unless so directed by
Parent. Parent shall not extend, directly or indirectly, any waiting periods
required in connection with the HSR Act or Foreign Antitrust Laws, or enter
into any agreement with any Governmental Entity to delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby unless such action is consented to by
the Company. 

   

 (c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section 7.5(a)_ hereof, in the event that any state anti-takeover or other similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger), each party shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) may be consummated in the most expeditious manner practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger). 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates be required to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, agree to any sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property, or the imposition of any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their respective businesses or to own or exercise control of such stock, businesses, assets or properties, if (i) such actions reasonably would be expected to have a material adverse effect on (A) the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) the benefits expected to be derived by Parent and its Subsidiaries from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) such actions reasonably would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the operations or businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (assuming for purposes of this determination that Parent and its Subsidiaries are of the equivalent size, and have equivalent revenues, to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole). 

  

 Section 7.6 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Appointment Time, the Company shall afford Parent and its accountants, legal counsel and other representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries to enable Parent to obtain all information concerning the business, including the status of product 

     ##### 

 

  

development efforts, properties, results of operations and personnel of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, as Parent may reasonably request; _provided,
however_ , that no information or Knowledge obtained by Parent in any
investigation conducted pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth
herein or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the
Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and  _provided
further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement (as
amended pursuant to _Section 7.9_ hereof) shall apply to any information
provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.6_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth herein, the Company shall not be required to
provide access to, or to disclose information, where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or contravene any applicable Law or Contract entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement;  _provided_ , _that_ , in such
circumstance, the Company shall cooperate with Parent to implement a
procedure to permit access to or disclosure of such information in a manner
that would not reasonably be expected to jeopardize the attorney/client
privilege or contravene such applicable Law or Contract.

 (b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Appointment Time the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of (i) any notice or other communication received by it from any third party, subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, alleging any material breach of or material default under any Material Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (ii) any notice or other communication received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any third party, subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this 

      ##### 

  

    

Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger); _provided, however_ , that (i)
no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation
or warranty of the Company set forth herein or the conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, or the remedies
available to the parties hereunder and (ii) the failure to give such any such

Section 9.1(d)(i) hereof or clause (C)(2) of Annex A hereto; and _provided
further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement (as
amended pursuant to _Section 7.9_ hereof) shall apply to any information

 Section 7.8 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing of any litigation commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its directors by any Company Stockholders (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company regarding the defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation and shall consider Parents views with respect to such stockholder litigation and shall not settle any such stockholder litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

  

 Section 7.9 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed a Confidentiality Agreement, dated August 18, 2010 (as amended, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, effective as of the execution and delivery hereof, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be amended so as to permit Parent to take any action contemplated by this Agreement, including the making of any counter-offer or offer contemplated by _Section 7.2(b)_ hereof (which deemed amendment shall survive any termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or otherwise).

 Section 7.11 _Treatment of Options_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option (or portion thereof) that (i) is outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any acceleration in connection with the Effective Time) and (ii) has an exercise price per Share that is less than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each former holder of any such cancelled Company Option as soon as practicable following the Effective Time an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the product of (i) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Company Option and (ii) the number of Shares subject to such Company Option. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, each Company Option (or portion thereof) that (i) is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) has an exercise price per Share that is less than the Merger Consideration, shall be assumed by Parent and converted automatically at the Effective Time into an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock, and which has other material terms and conditions substantially the same terms as those of the related Company Option, except that (x) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Company Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by a fraction (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), the numerator of which is the per share Merger Consideration and the denominator of which is the average closing price of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE over the five (5) trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the date on which the Effective Time occurs (rounded down to the nearest whole share) and (y) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) shall equal (A) the exercise price per Share of the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio. It is the intention of the parties that each Company Option shall qualify following the Effective Time as an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 

      ##### 

  

    

of the Code to the extent permitted under Section 422 of the Code and to the
extent such Company Option qualified as an incentive stock option at the
Effective Time. The exercise price per share and the number of shares of
Parent Stock purchasable pursuant to each converted Company Option following
the Effective Time as well as the terms and conditions of exercise of such
option shall be determined in order to comply with Sections 424(a) and 409A
of the Code. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs (a) and (b), at the Effective Time, (i) each Company Option, whether vested or unvested, that (A) is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) has an exercise price per Share that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration and (ii) each Company Option that (A) is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than those Company Options that, by their terms, vest (through acceleration or otherwise) prior to or upon the Effective Time) and (B) is held by (1) a non-employee director of the Company, (2) a person who is not an employee of, or a consultant to, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (3) a person who ceases to be an employee or consultant of the Company upon the Effective Time, shall be canceled, and the holder thereof shall not be entitled to any cash payment, options to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock, or other consideration in respect thereof. 

   

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver all required notices (which notices shall have been approved by Parent, in its reasonable discretion), if any, to each holder of Company Equity Award setting forth each holders rights pursuant to the respective Company Equity Plan, stating that such Company Equity Awards shall be treated in the manner set forth in this  _Section 7.11_. 

   

 (e) The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, as of the Effective Time, (i) the Company Equity Plans shall terminate and (ii) no holder of a Company Equity Award or any participant in any Company Equity Plan or any other employee incentive or benefit plan, program or arrangement or any non-employee director plan maintained by the Company shall have any rights to acquire, or other rights in respect of, the capital stock of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, except the right to receive the payment contemplated by _Section 7.11(a)_ in cancellation and settlement thereof or the right to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock contemplated by _Section 7.11(b)_. 

   

 (f) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Date, Parent shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the shares of Parent Stock issuable upon exercise of the Company Options that are assumed by Parent hereunder, and Parent shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such Company Options remain outstanding. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not issue any shares of Parent Stock in respect of any Company Option until the S-8 to be filed as herein provided is so filed and becomes effective. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (g) Within five (5) Business Days after request from Parent to do so (which request shall not be given more than five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time), the Company shall take such action as may be necessary to establish a New Exercise Date (as defined under the Companys 2007 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ")) prior to the Effective Time with respect to the Offering Periods (as defined in the ESPP) otherwise then in effect (the " _Final Exercise Date_ "). Each outstanding option under the ESPP on the Final Exercise Date shall be exercised on such date for the purchase of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. For clarity, the Company shall take such action as may be necessary to terminate the ESPP as of the Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time. 

   

 (h) Subject to Parents compliance with the preceding provisions of this _Section 7.11_, the parties agree that, following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Equity Award or any participant in any Company Equity Plan, or other Company Employee Plan or employee benefit arrangement of the Company or under any employment agreement shall have any right hereunder to acquire any Equity Interest (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) in the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 Section 7.12 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall, upon the receipt of notice from Parent at least one day prior to the date the Company is expected to become a member of the same Controlled Group of Corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent, terminate, effective as of the day immediately preceding the date the Company becomes a member of the same Controlled Group of Corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent (the " _401(k) Termination Date_ "), any and all 401(k) plans maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company shall provide Parent evidence that the 401(k) plan(s) of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be substantially in the form contained in Section 7.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and any material modifications to such form shall be subject to the review and approval of Parent. The Company shall also take such other actions in furtherance of terminating any such 401(k) Plans as Parent may reasonably request. 

   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall permit all Continuing Employees who become employees of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to participate in the benefit programs (including, without limitation, severance plans) of Parent or the Subsidiary to the same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent or the Subsidiary. In the U.S., Continuing Employees who become employees of Parent shall be given credit for all service with the Company or its U.S. Subsidiaries solely for purposes of determining their rate of vacation accrual under Parents standard vacation program and their level of benefits under Parents standard severance plan; service credit for all other purposes shall begin at the Effective Time. Outside the U.S., Continuing Employees who become employees of a Subsidiary of Parent shall be given credit for service with the Company or its Subsidiaries solely as required by applicable Law. From and after the 

      ##### 

  

    

Effective Time, Parent shall (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or
limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any U.S. group health plans
of Parent or its Subsidiaries to be waived with respect to the Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents and (ii) give each of the Continuing
Employee in the U.S. credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs toward applicable deductibles and annual out of pocket limits for
expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has been
made. Unused vacation days accrued by U.S. Continuing Employees under the
plans and policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall carry over
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation to the extent administratively
practicable, and each such Continuing Employee shall be paid by the Company
in cash for any accrued and unused vacation days that Parent determines are
not administratively practicable to carry over. 

   

 (c) For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time all existing employment, change of control, severance and retention arrangements (including the retention program described in Section 7.12(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter) between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current or former employee, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent or its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any such plans or agreements, so long as such amendment or termination complies with the terms of any such plans or agreements, including specifically obtaining any necessary or required consents. 

   

 (d) The Company shall terminate any and all group severance, separation, deferred compensation or salary continuation plans, programs or policies (other than the arrangements described in  _Section 7.12(c)_ above) maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, effective in each case as of the day immediately preceding the last day of the initial period of the Offer (not including any subsequent offer period provided by Parent pursuant to Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act). The Company shall provide Parent evidence that such plans have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent). 

   

 (e) _Section 7.12(b)_ shall not operate to duplicate any benefit provided to any employee, require Parent to continue in effect any specific Company employee benefit plan or Parent employee benefit plan, or prohibit the termination of any specific employee, following the Effective Time. Nothing contained herein, express or implied (i) shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Company or any of their respective affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them. 

   

 (f) This _Section 7.12_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 7.12_, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 7.12_. 

       ##### 

  

     

 Section 7.13 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all indemnification agreements in effect immediately prior to the Appointment Time between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Appointment Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "). In addition, for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) (i) cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation that are at least as favorable as the indemnification and exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Appointment Time, and during such six (6) year period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who were covered by such provisions, except as required by applicable Law and (ii) and honor and fulfill the obligations of the Company under any indemnification agreements in effect as of the date hereof between the Company and any Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of any and all such claims. 

   

 (b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation with respect to any matters, following request in writing from the applicable director or officer, and subject to indemnification pursuant to the procedures set forth, and to the extent provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Appointment Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Person to whom expenses are advanced undertakes, to the extent required by the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Appointment Time or the DGCL, to repay such advanced expenses to Parent or the Surviving Corporation as soon as reasonably practicable if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. 

   

 (c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Appointment Time, covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance immediately prior to the Appointment Time, on terms with respect to the coverage, retention, limitations of liability and amounts no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those of the DandO Insurance in effect on the Agreement Date and with an insurance company with the same or better credit rating as the insurance company providing the 

      ##### 

  

    

current DandO Insurance; _provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation
may, at its option, (i) substitute therefor policies of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries containing terms with
respect to coverage, retention, limitations of liability and amounts no less
favorable, in the aggregate, to such persons than the DandO Insurance or (ii)
request that the Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage under
its existing insurance program (to be effective as of the Effective Time),
_provided further, however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under this
_Section 7.13(c)_ Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%)
of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year
(such two hundred fifty percent (250%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_
") (which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in
_Section 7.13_ of the Company Disclosure Letter), provided that that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual
Premium. Prior to the Appointment Time, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent or the Company may purchase a
six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance containing terms with
respect to coverage, retention, limitations of liability and amounts no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than the DandO Insurance in effect on the
Agreement Date and with an insurance company with the same or better credit
rating as the insurance company providing the current DandO Insurance. In the
event that Parent shall purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the
Appointment Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such
"tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective
obligations thereunder through such six-year period, in lieu of all
other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first
sentence of this _Section 7.13(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be
maintained in full force and effect. 

   

 (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section 7.13_. 

   

 (e) The obligations under this _Section 7.13_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.13(c)_ hereof (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.13(c)_ hereof (and their heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Parties or other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.13(c)_ hereof (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.13_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in  _Section 7.13(c)_ hereof (and their heirs and 

      ##### 

  

    

representatives)) under this _Section 7.13_ shall be in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the
certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or
entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law
(whether at law or in equity). 

   

 Section 7.14 _FIRPTA Certificate_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a properly executed statement in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent for purposes of satisfying Parents obligations under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispositions of Company Shares (including derivative securities with respect to such Company Shares) by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters. 

  

 Section 7.16 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall, and shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to, perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.17 _Employment Compensation Approval_. The parties acknowledge that certain payments have been made or are to be made and certain benefits have been granted or are to be granted according to employment compensation, severance and other employee benefit plans of the Company, including the Company Plans (collectively, the " _Arrangements_ "), to certain Company Stockholders and holders of other Company Shares and Company Equity Awards (collectively, the " _Covered Securityholders_ "). The Compensation Committee of the Company Board (the " _Company Compensation Committee_ "), each member of which is an "independent director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act, (A) at a meeting to be held or pursuant to unanimous written consent effective prior to the Appointment Time, will duly adopt resolutions approving as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act (an " _Employment Compensation Arrangement_ ") (1) each Arrangement presented to the Company Compensation Committee on or prior to the date hereof, and (2) the terms of _Section 7.11_, _Section 7.12_ and  _Section 7.13_, and (B) will take all other actions necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to the foregoing arrangements. 

  

 Section 7.18 _Resignation of Directors and Officers_. Prior to the Effective Time, at the request of Parent, the Company shall cause each director and each officer of the Company and/or any Subsidiary of the Company to execute and deliver a letter 

   ##### 

  

 

effectuating his or her resignation as a director or officer of the Company
and/or any applicable Subsidiary effective as of the Effective Time. At the

replacement of any such directors and officers selected by Parent at
the Effective Time.
