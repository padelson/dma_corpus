(the "Purchaser"), Colt Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation, and a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser (the "Merger Sub") and Shareholder
Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (the
"Representative"), acting solely in its capacity as representative for the

R E C I T A L S

WHEREAS, the Purchaser desires to acquire 100% of the Company Stock in a
reverse subsidiary merger transaction on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein and in accordance with the Delaware Law;

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Purchaser, the Merger Sub
and the Company have authorized, adopted and approved this Agreement and
determined that this Agreement and the Merger are desirable and in the best
interests of their respective corporations and stockholders or equityholders;

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Merger Sub and the Company
have recommended the Merger to their respective stockholders; and

WHEREAS, this Agreement will be adopted, and the transactions contemplated
hereby will be approved, by the written consent in substantially the form of
Exhibit C attached hereto (the "Written Consent") of Stockholders holding (i)
at least a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the Company in
accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL, and (ii) at least fifty-five percent
(55%) of the votes attributable to the then outstanding shares of Preferred

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I



THE MERGER



1.01 Effect of the Merger.

(a)At the Effective Time, the Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company
in accordance with Delaware Law (the "Merger"), whereupon the separate
existence of the Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will be the surviving
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Purchaser (the "Surviving
Corporation"). The Surviving Corporation will continue to be named "BioStorage
Technologies, Inc.".

(b)The Merger will become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger
is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such
later time as is specified in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective
Time"). (c)From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will succeed
to all the assets, rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject to
all of the Liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the
Company and the Merger Sub, all as provided under Delaware Law.

1.02 Merger Consideration.

(a) The aggregate consideration to be paid by the Purchaser in respect of the
Merger, subject to adjustment as set forth herein, will be an amount in cash
equal to $127,000,000 (the "Base Purchase Price"). The Base Purchase Price
will be increased or decreased as follows (which resulting amount, which for
avoidance of doubt includes the Optionholders Closing Merger Consideration
determined in accordance with Section 1.05(a), is hereinafter referred to as
the "Closing Merger Consideration"):

(i)minus the amount (if any) by which Closing Net Working Capital is less than
Target Net Working Capital or plus the amount (if any) by which Closing Net
Working Capital is greater than Target Net Working Capital (as applicable);

(ii)minus the aggregate amount of Closing Debt;

(iii)minus the aggregate amount of Closing Transaction Expenses (including the
Change of Control Payment Amount deposited into the CIC Escrow Account);

(iv) plus the aggregate amount of Closing Cash;

(v)minus the Aggregate Escrow Amount; and

(vi)minus the Representative Holdback Amount.

(b) The Closing Merger Consideration will be estimated prior to, and adjusted
after, the Closing pursuant to Section 2.03, and will be increased by the
aggregate amount (if any) required to be paid or distributed to the
Stockholders or the Optionholders (whether directly or indirectly through the
Paying Agent) after the Closing, including the amount of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Funds paid or distributed pursuant to Section 2.03(h) and
any amounts from the Indemnification Escrow Account and the CIC Escrow Account
paid or distributed pursuant to Section 9.01(b) or Section 10.08 (the
aggregate amount of such increase, the "Additional Merger Consideration" and
the amount of the Additional Merger Consideration, if any, plus the Final
Closing Merger Consideration determined pursuant to Section 2.03 will be
referred to herein, which for avoidance of doubt includes the Optionholders
Merger Consideration determined in accordance with Section 1.05(a), as the
"Merger Consideration").

(c) The Merger Consideration will be: (i) allocated among the Stockholders and
the Optionholders pursuant Section 1.03 and Section 1.05, respectively; and
(ii) paid to the Stockholders and the Optionholders pursuant and subject to
the applicable terms and conditions set forth in Section 1.04, Section 1.05,
Article II and elsewhere in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, for
purposes of calculating the Merger Consideration hereunder: no items included
in the definitions of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Debt, Closing
Transaction Expenses (or any components thereof) will be double counted.

1.03 Conversion of Company Stock; Stockholder Allocation. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Stockholders or any other Person:

(a) each share of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and shares of Preferred Stock
held as treasury stock of the Company) that are held by the Stockholders will
be converted into solely the right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the portion of the Merger Consideration payable to the
holders of the Preferred Stock in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation in effect immediately before the Effective Time and as set forth in the Payment Spreadsheet delivered by the
Company pursuant to Section 2.03(a)(ii);

(b) each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares, Option Shares and shares of
Common Stock held as treasury stock of the Company) that are held by the
Stockholders will be converted into solely the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the portion of the Merger Consideration
payable to the holders of the Common Stock in accordance with the Certificate
of Incorporation in effect immediately before the Effective Time and as set
forth in the Payment Spreadsheet delivered by the Company pursuant to Section
2.03(a)(ii);

(c) each share of Company Stock held immediately prior to the Effective Time
by the Company as treasury stock or by the Merger Sub will be canceled, and no
payment will be made with respect thereto;

(d) each share of the Merger Sub's common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and non assessable share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and collectively shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation and each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of
any such shares shall evidence ownership of such shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation; and

(e) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Stock shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and
each holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the rights set forth in this Section 1.03.

1.04 Exchange of Certificates; Lost Certificates; Paying Agent. At any time
after obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Company may direct the Paying
Agent to deliver the Letters of Transmittal to the Stockholders for use in
effecting the surrender of Company Stock in exchange for each such
Stockholder's portion of the Merger Consideration; provided, that, if the
Paying Agent has not delivered the Letter of Transmittal to each Stockholder
prior to the Effective Time, then the Purchaser will direct and cause the
Paying Agent to deliver the Letter of Transmittal to each Stockholder promptly
(but in any event within three (3) Business Days) after the Closing Date. The
Paying Agent will pay to each Stockholder who duly executes and delivers to
the Paying Agent a Letter of Transmittal (and all other required information,
documents and instruments, including certificates representing any shares of
Company Stock) with respect to his, her or its shares of Company Stock
outstanding as of the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the portion of
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares pursuant to Section
1.03; provided, that, until a duly executed and delivered Letter of
Transmittal (and all other required information, documents and instruments,
including certificates representing any shares of Company Stock) are delivered
to the Paying Agent: (a) such shares will represent solely the right to
receive the portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such
shares; and (b) neither the Paying Agent nor the Surviving Corporation will be
required to pay any Stockholder the portion of the Merger Consideration to
which such Stockholder would otherwise have been entitled under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of such fact
by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and
the providing of an indemnity by such Person, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Paying Agent and the Purchaser, against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to the shares represented by such certificate,
the Paying Agent will, in exchange therefor, pay such Person the amount of
cash to which he, she or it is entitled under Section 1.03. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Purchaser shall not be
obligated or required to post a bond for any Person for any reason in
connection with a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate representing Company
Stock or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the parties to TTthis Agreement and the Paying Agent will not be liable to any Stockholder for any portion of the Merger Consideration
delivered to a Governmental Body if such delivery is required pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.....

1.05 Options; Certain Payments Processed Through Payroll.

(a) The Company will cause all outstanding Options to be canceled as of the
Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each Optionholder that has delivered to
the Company, the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation an Option Cancellation
Agreement will become entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the
portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Common
Stock that would have been issued if the Options held by such Optionholder
were exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (as determined assuming
a net exercise of such Options based on the applicable exercise price in
respect thereof) in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation in effect
immediately before the Effective Time and as set forth in the Payment
Spreadsheet delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 2.03(a)(ii).

The aggregate portion of the Merger Consideration to which Optionholders
become entitled pursuant to this Section 1.05(a) is collectively referred to
herein as the "Optionholders Merger Consideration". The aggregate portion of
the Estimated Closing Merger Consideration to which the Optionholders become
entitled pursuant to this Section 1.05(a) is collectively referred to herein
as the "Optionholders Closing Merger Consideration".

(b) The Surviving Corporation will act as paying agent in effecting the
payment of the Optionholders Merger Consideration. The Surviving Corporation
will (and the Purchaser will cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay the
Optionholders Closing Merger Consideration to the applicable individual
recipients through the Surviving Corporation's payroll system: (i) in the case
of the Optionholders Closing Merger Consideration payable to Optionholders
that have delivered an Option Cancellation Agreement to the Company on or
prior to the Closing Date, on the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of the
Optionholders Closing Merger Consideration payable to Optionholders that have
not delivered an Option Cancellation Agreement to the Company on or prior to
the Closing Date, promptly following the date on which such Optionholder
delivers an Option Cancellation Agreement to the Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation; and (iii) in the case of any other portion of the Optionholders
Merger Consideration, on the next regularly scheduled payroll date after the
date on which such amount becomes due pursuant to this Agreement, which will,
in any event, be within ten (10) Business Days following such due date.
Without limiting the provisions of Section 1.09, the Surviving Corporation (or
any other Person that has any withholding obligation with respect to any
payment made pursuant to this Section 1.05) will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any payments to be made pursuant to this Section 1.05 any Taxes
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payments under the Code or any other applicable provision of Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable
individual recipient on behalf of whom such deduction and withholding was
made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the parties to this Agreement
and the Paying Agent will not be liable to any Optionholder for any portion of
the Optionholders Merger Consideration delivered to a Governmental Body if
such delivery is required pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the employer portion of
any payroll Taxes due with respect to any payments of the Optionholders Merger
Consideration will be treated as a Transaction Expense and will be remitted by
the Surviving Corporation in connection with its Tax filings.

1.06 Certificate of Incorporation. As of the Effective Time, the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation will be amended and restated
pursuant to the terms set forth in the Certificate of Merger, and as so
amended and restated, will be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable Law. 1.07 Bylaws. The bylaws of the Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time will
be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (except that the title thereof will
read "Bylaws of "BioStorage Technologies, Inc.") and, as so amended and
restated, will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in
accordance with applicable Law.

1.08 Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected or appointed in accordance with applicable Law (or
their earlier resignation or removal), the directors and officers of the
Merger Sub at the Effective Time will be the directors and officers, as
applicable, of the Surviving Corporation, except as otherwise agreed among the
parties and as otherwise set forth in Section 3.01(h) hereof.

1.09 Withholding. The Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation (and any other
Person that has any withholding obligation with respect to any payment made
pursuant to this Agreement) and the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as the Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or such other Person is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other
applicable provision of Law; provided, that, the Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation will use reasonable best efforts to provide the Representative
with reasonable notice prior to withholding any amounts pursuant to this
Section 1.09 (other than any withholding required in respect of payments of
the Optionholders Merger Consideration), and will work in good faith with the
Representative to minimize any such withheld amounts. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts will be timely paid over to the
applicable Tax authority in accordance with applicable Law and, except to the
extent this Agreement expressly provides to the contrary, will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

1.10 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any shares of Company Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by Stockholders who,
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Appraisal Rights
Provisions"): (i) have not consented as part of the Stockholder Approval to
adopt and approve this Agreement; (ii) have properly demanded in writing on or
before the date required under the Appraisal Rights Provisions appraisal for
such shares and complied in all respects with the Appraisal Rights Provisions;
and (iii) have effectively withdrawn, lost or failed to perfect their rights
to appraisal under the Appraisal Rights Provisions (collectively, the
"Dissenting Shares"), will not be converted as described in Section 1.03, but
at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, will be cancelled and will cease to exist and will
represent the right to receive only those rights provided under the Appraisal
Rights Provisions; provided, however, that all shares of Company Stock held by
Stockholders who have failed to perfect or who have effectively withdrawn or
lost their rights to appraisal of such Company Stock under the Appraisal
Rights Provisions will thereupon be deemed to have been cancelled and retired
and to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration provided for in Section 1.03, as applicable,
and the Purchaser (to the extent the following amounts have been previously
delivered by the Paying Agent to the Purchaser pursuant to the next sentence
and not returned to the Paying Agent) or the Paying Agent shall deliver to
such holder (i) such holder's portion of the Estimated Closing Merger
Consideration that is attributable to such shares at the time such rights are
withdrawn or lost and (ii) such holder's portions of the Additional Merger
Consideration, if any, attributable to such shares at the time such portions
are determined. Persons who have perfected statutory rights with respect to
Dissenting Shares as aforesaid will not be paid by the Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation as provided in this Agreement and shall have only such
rights as are provided by the Appraisal Rights Provisions with respect to such
Dissenting Shares. In the event that a Stockholder properly perfects such
Stockholder's appraisal, rights by demanding and not effectively withdrawing
or losing such Stockholder's appraisal rights for any shares of Company Stock,
the Paying Agent shall deliver to the Purchaser (a) such Stockholder's portion of the
Estimated Closing Merger Consideration that is attributable to such shares at
the time such portion of such Estimated Closing Merger Consideration is
determined and such rights are perfected and (b) such Stockholder's portions
of the Additional Merger Consideration, if any, allocable to such shares at
the time such rights are perfected and such portions are determined and are
received by the Paying Agent from the Escrow Agent or the Purchaser, as
applicable. The Company will give the Purchaser prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for the exercise of appraisal rights with respect to
Company Stock, and the Purchaser shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company will
not, except with the prior written consent of the Purchaser or, following
Closing, the Representative, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands.

1.11 Transfer of Company Stock and Options After the Effective Time. No
transfers of shares of Company Stock or any Options shall be made on the stock
and option transfer books of the Company after the close of business on the
Business Day preceding the date of the Effective Time.

Representative a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth the
Purchaser's calculation of: (i) the Closing Net Working Capital, including
each of the components thereof, and a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet"); and (ii) Closing Cash, Closing
Debt and Closing Transaction Expenses, including each of the components
thereof; and (iii) the Closing Merger Consideration determined based on the

(c) The Closing Balance Sheet will be delivered together with:

(i) a worksheet (and any related work papers, supporting detail or other
materials used or created by or on behalf of the Purchaser or its Affiliates
or representatives for purposes of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet) which

and (B) the items and amounts included in the Closing Balance Sheet were
calculated and determined by the Purchaser based on (and are consistent with)
the books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

(d) The post-Closing adjustment to the Closing Merger Consideration as set
forth in this Section 2.03 is not intended to permit the introduction of
accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures, conventions,
categorizations, definitions, principles, judgments, assumptions, techniques
or estimation methods with respect to financial statements, their
classification or presentation or otherwise (including with respect to the
nature of accounts, level of reserves or level of accruals) that are different
from those specified in the Accounting Principles, the Working Capital
Calculation Annex; it being the intent of the parties hereto that: (i) the
Closing Net Working Capital be calculated consistently with the foregoing
requirements in order to allow a meaningful comparison of the Closing Net
Working Capital to the Target Net Working Capital; and (ii) Closing Cash,
Closing Debt and Closing Transaction Expenses set forth on the Closing
Statement be calculated consistently with the definition of Closing Cash,
Closing Debt and Closing Transaction Expenses.

(e) The Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation)
will:

(i) permit the Representative and its representatives to have reasonable
access during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to the
books, records and other documents (including work papers, schedules,
financial statements, memoranda, etc.) pertaining to or used in connection
with the preparation of the Closing Statement or the Closing Balance Sheet and
the Purchaser's calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash,
Closing Debt and Closing Transaction Expenses or the Closing Merger
Consideration (or any component thereof) and provide the Representative with
copies thereof (as reasonably requested by the Representative); and

(ii) provide the Representative and its representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to the
Purchaser's and its Subsidiaries' (including the Surviving Corporation's)
employees and advisors (including making their chief financial officer(s) and
accountants available to respond to reasonable written or oral inquiries of
the Representative or its representatives).

If the Representative disagrees with any part of the Purchaser's calculation
of the Closing Merger Consideration as set forth on the Closing Statement or
the Closing Balance Sheet, the Representative will, within 60 days after the
Representative's receipt of the Closing Statement and the Closing Balance
Sheet, notify the Purchaser in writing of such disagreement by setting forth
the Representative's calculation of the Closing Merger Consideration,
including each of the components thereof, and describing in reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement (an "Objection Notice"). If an
Objection Notice is delivered to the Purchaser, then the Purchaser and the
Representative will negotiate in good faith to resolve their disagreements
with respect to the computation of the Closing Merger Consideration. In the
event that the Purchaser and the Representative are unable to resolve all such
disagreements within 30 days after the Purchaser's receipt of such Objection
Notice, the Purchaser and the Representative will submit such remaining
disagreements to Ernst and Young LLP, or a regionally or nationally recognized
independent accounting firm as is acceptable to the Purchaser and the
Representative (the "Accounting Firm").

(f) The Purchaser and the Representative will cooperate with the Accounting
Firm during the term of its engagement and will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve all remaining disagreements
with respect to the computation of the Closing Merger Consideration, including
each of the components thereof, as soon as practicable. The Accounting Firm
will consider only those items and amounts in the Purchaser's and the
Representative's respective calculations of the Closing Merger Consideration,
including each of the components thereof, that are identified as being items
and amounts to which the Purchaser and the Representative have been unable to
agree. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm may not assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
party. The Accounting Firm's determination of the Closing Merger
Consideration, including each of the components thereof, will be based solely
on written materials submitted by the Purchaser and the Representative (i.e.,
not on independent review) and on the definitions included herein. The
determination of the Accounting Firm will be conclusive and binding upon the
parties hereto and will not be subject to appeal or further review.

(g) The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm in determining the Closing
Merger Consideration, including each of the components thereof, will be borne
by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders and the Optionholders), on the other hand, based upon the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party
bears to the amount actually contested by such party. Prior to the Accounting
Firm's determination of Closing Merger Consideration: (i) the Purchaser, on
the one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and the
Optionholders), on the other hand, will each pay 50% of any retainer paid to
the Accounting Firm; and (ii) during the engagement of the Accounting Firm,
the Accounting Firm will bill 50% of the total charges to each of the
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders and the Optionholders), on the other hand. In connection with the
Accounting Firm's determination of the Closing Merger Consideration, the
Accounting Firm will also determine, pursuant to the terms of the first and
second sentences of this Section 2.03(g), and taking into account all fees and
expenses already paid by each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and the Optionholders), on the
other hand, as of the date of such determination, the allocation of its fees
and expenses between the Purchaser and the Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders and the Optionholders), which such determination will be
conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto. For purposes of this Agreement
the Closing Merger Consideration, Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash,
Closing Debt and Closing Transaction Expenses, in each case, as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.03 will be referred to herein as, the
"Final Closing Merger Consideration," "Final Closing Net Working Capital,"
"Final Closing Cash," "Final Closing Debt," and "Final Closing Transaction
Expenses," respectively.

(h) Within three (3) Business Days after the Final Closing Merger
Consideration, including each of the components thereof, is finally determined
pursuant to this Section 2.03:

(i) if the Final Closing Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated
Closing Merger Consideration (the amount of such deficiency, the "Purchaser
Adjustment Amount"), then the Purchaser and the Representative will cause the
Escrow Agent, including through the execution and delivery of a joint written instruction, to: (A) pay to the Purchaser an
amount (which in no case will exceed the amount of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Funds plus the Indemnification Escrow Funds) equal to such
deficiency, which payment will be satisfied first from the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Funds and, to the extent that the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Funds are not sufficient to satisfy the full amount of such payment,
then from the Indemnification Escrow Funds; and (B) pay to the Paying Agent
for further distribution to the Stockholders and the Optionholders the amount
(if any) by which the amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds is
greater than the Purchaser Adjustment Amount; and

(ii) if the Final Closing Merger Consideration is greater than the Estimated
Closing Merger Consideration (the amount of such deficiency, the "Seller
Adjustment Amount"), then: (A) the Purchaser will, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation or one or more of its Subsidiaries to, pay to the Paying Agent for
further distribution to the Stockholders and the Optionholders the Seller
Adjustment Amount; and (B) the Purchaser and the Representative will cause the
Escrow Agent, including through the execution and delivery of a joint written
instruction, to pay to the Paying Agent for further distribution to the
Stockholders and the Optionholders all of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Funds; provided, that the Purchaser does not have to make such payment or
cause such payment to be made under clause (A) or execute or deliver any such
instruction under clause (B) until the day that is two (2) Business Days after
the Purchaser's receipt of the written direction of the Representative
referred to in such clauses.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the Change of
Control Payment Amount as determined at Closing is increased as a result of
the determination of the Final Closing Merger Consideration under this Section
2.03, the Purchaser and the Representative will cause the Escrow Agent,
including through the execution and delivery of a joint written instruction,
to transfer the amount of such increase from the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Account to the CIC Escrow Account.

Any payment to be made pursuant to this Section 2.03(h) will: (x) be treated
by all parties for tax purposes as adjustments to the Base Purchase Price; and
(y) be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s)
designated by the Purchaser or the Paying Agent, as applicable. The payments
to be made pursuant to this Section 2.03(h) (together with the Purchaser's
rights under the Escrow Agreement) will be the Purchaser's sole and exclusive
source of recovery and remedy for any amounts owing to the Purchaser pursuant
to this Section 2.03, except for any claims for Unpaid Transaction Expenses or
Unpaid Closing Debt.

Agreements received by the Company prior to the Closing to the Purchaser
promptly upon receipt. ARTICLE VII

COVENANTS OF THE PURCHASER

7.01 Access to Books and Records. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser
will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
provide the Representative and its agents (at its own expense) with reasonable
access (for the purpose of examining and copying), during normal business
hours, and upon reasonable advance notice to the authorized representatives,
to the books and records of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
with respect to periods or occurrences prior to the Closing Date and
reasonable access, during normal business hours, and upon reasonable advance
notice, to employees of each of the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, and
each of their respective Affiliates for purposes of complying with any
applicable tax, financial reporting or regulatory requirements or any other
reasonable business purpose. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the
Representative, neither the Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation will, for
a period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or
otherwise dispose of any of the books and records of the Company for any
period prior to the Closing Date without first offering to surrender to the
Representative such books and records or any portion thereof which the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Section 7.01 shall require the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to provide
any such access or furnish any such information that in its reasonable
judgment would (a) violate any Law, (b) compromise or constitute a waiver of
any attorney-client or other privilege of the Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries or (b) violate any covenant,
agreement or obligation of the Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary
under a contract entered into prior to the date of this Agreement; provided,
however, that if the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries are so restricted, they shall promptly notify the Representative
that information or records are being withheld and provide the Representative
with as much information as reasonably possible with respect to such
information or records.

7.02 Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification.

(a) Prior to or simultaneously with the Closing, the Purchaser will, or will
cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase an extended reporting period or
tail endorsement to the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' current
directors' and officers' liability insurance program affording coverage to
those individuals currently insured under the Company's policy with a policy
limit of at least $3,000,000 (the "DandO Tail Policy"). The DandO Tail Policy
shall be issued on terms no less favorable (including with respect to scope)
than the policy maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary providing
such coverage immediately prior to the Closing for the benefit of such
individuals, and shall provide coverage for an aggregate period of not less
than six (6) years with respect to claims arising from acts, events or
omissions that occurred at or prior to the time of Closing, including with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If the aggregate
cost for the DandO Tail Policy exceeds $51,000 (the "Premium Cap Amount"), then
the coverage terms of the DandO Tail Policy will be adjusted to provide the
maximum amount of coverage that the Purchaser is able to obtain based on the
Premium Cap Amount, subject to the Company's approval of such adjusted
coverage terms.

(b) The Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the
Company Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill their obligations under any and all
indemnification agreements between the Surviving Corporation or such Company
Subsidiary and any of its current or former managers, directors and officers.
For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and
the Company Subsidiaries will not (and the Purchaser will not, and will not
permit the Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary to), amend, repeal
or otherwise modify any provision in the Surviving Corporation's or any
Company Subsidiary's certificate of incorporation, articles of incorporation,
articles of organization, bylaws or operating agreement (or equivalent
governing documents) relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any officers, directors or similar functionaries (unless to
provide for greater exculpation or indemnification or unless required by Law),
it being the intent of the parties hereto that the current and former
officers, directors and similar functionaries of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries will continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification (including with respect to advancement of expenses) to the
full extent of the Law. The Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that this
Section 7.02 will be binding on the Purchaser's successors and assigns.

(c) If the Surviving Corporation, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective successors or assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries will assume all of the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.02.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after
the Closing Date) is made against any individual who was an officer, director
or similar functionary of the Company or any Company Subsidiary at or prior to
the Effective Time, on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, the provisions of Section 7.02(b) will continue in effect
until final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation; provided, however, that the provisions of Section 7.02(b) will
continue in effect only with respect to that particular claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation which is made on or prior to the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time.

(e) The obligations under this Section 7.02 will not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to affect adversely any indemnitee or exculpee to whom
this Section 7.02 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee or
exculpee. The provisions of this Section 7.02 are intended for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by (as express third party beneficiaries), each
current and former officer, director or similar functionary of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and representatives, successors
and assigns and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have had by
contract or otherwise.

7.03 Contact with Business Relations. The Purchaser is not authorized to and
will not (and will not permit any of its employees, agents, representatives or
Affiliates to) contact (directly or indirectly) any officer, director or
employee (other than Michael Reffeitt, the CFO of the Company, or Gregory J.
Swanberg, the CEO of the Company) or any agent, broker, partner, lender,
lessor, vendor, customer, supplier, consultant or other business relation of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing without the prior
written consent of one of the foregoing Company officers, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

7.04 Continuing Confidentiality. The Purchaser will remain bound by that
certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of August 14, 2015, with the
Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement") in accordance with its respective
terms and it will be responsible for any breaches of the Confidentiality
Agreement by any of the Purchaser's representatives.

7.05 Payments to Stockholders, Optionholders and Other Individuals. As
required in order to comply with applicable Tax withholding requirements and
without limiting anything set forth in Article I, any payments required to be
made hereunder (including distributions from the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Account, the CIC Escrow Account, or the Indemnification Escrow Account)
to any Stockholder who is an employee or any Optionholder (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, disbursements of Final Closing Transaction Expenses or any
other portion of the Merger Consideration or the Change of Control Payment
Amount), may be made through the payroll processing system of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (or the Surviving Corporation's payroll
agent) on the next regularly scheduled payroll date after the scheduled date of receipt of such amounts. Upon payment
of any such amounts to the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving
Corporation's payroll agent, as applicable, the Purchaser will be relieved of
its obligation to pay such amounts to such applicable individual. To ensure
compliance with Treasury Regulation 1.409A 3(i)(5)(iv), the Optionholders will
not be entitled to receive any payment, and no payment will be made to the
Optionholders, in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby later
than the date which is five (5) years after the Closing Date (it being
understood that the Stockholders may receive payments after the date which is
five (5) years after the Closing Date, including, for the avoidance of doubt,
amounts that, if paid prior to the date which is five (5) years after the
Closing Date, would have been paid to the Optionholders).

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION

8.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time only as follows and in no other manner:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Company;

(b) by the Purchaser and the Merger Sub, on the one hand, or by the Company,
on the other hand, upon the issuance by any Governmental Body of an order,
decree or ruling or their taking of any other action restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Merger, which order, decree, ruling or any other
action shall have become final and non appealable;

(c) by the Purchaser and the Merger Sub, on the one hand, or by the Company,

if all other conditions to Closing are satisfied other than those that are
required to be satisfied on the Closing Date, either the Purchaser or the
Company may postpone the Outside Date for up to two (2) additional 45 day
periods if the Required Regulatory Approvals have not been obtained and have
not been denied by a non-appealable decision of a Governmental Body, by giving
written notice to the other party to such effect no later than 5:00 p.m.
(Eastern time) on the date that is not less than five (5) Business Days prior
to the original Outside Date (and a subsequent Outside Date, if applicable);
and (ii) no termination may be made under this Section 8.01(c) if the failure
to close is caused by the action or inaction of the terminating party;

(d) by the Purchaser and the Merger Sub, upon a breach of any covenant or
agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty contained in Article IV shall be or have become
untrue, in either case, such that any of the condition set forth in Section
3.01(a), 3.01(b) or 3.01(c) would not be satisfied; provided, however, that
the Company shall have, upon notice provided to the Purchaser, ten (10)
Business Days to cure such breach if such breach is curable through the
exercise of commercially reasonable efforts;

(e) by the Company, upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of
the Purchaser or the Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of the Purchaser or the Merger Sub will be or have
become untrue, in either case, such that any of the condition set forth in
Section 3.02(a) or 3.02(b) would not be satisfied; provided, however, that the
Purchaser and the Merger Sub shall have, upon notice provided to the Company,
ten (10) Business Days to cure such breach if such breach is curable through
the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts ;

(f) by the Purchaser and the Merger Sub, upon written notice to the Company,
if since the date of this Agreement, the Company has experienced a Material
Adverse Change; or

(g) by the Purchaser and the Merger Sub, if the Company does not deliver to
the Purchaser the Written Consent in accordance with Section 6.03. 8.02 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.01, this Agreement will become void and of no further force and
effect (other than this Section 8.02, Section 12.01, Section 12.02, Section
12.13, Section 12.14, Section 12.17 and Article XIII which will survive the
termination of this Agreement) without any Liability or obligation on the part
of any party hereto:

(a) other than liabilities and obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement; and

(b) except that no such termination will relieve any party hereto of any
liability for damages resulting from any material breach by such party of this
Agreement (including, in the case of the Purchaser and Merger Sub, any failure
to have sufficient immediately available funds for the consummation of the
transaction contemplated hereby), except that if the non-terminating party
proves by the preponderance of the evidence that its breach was not willful,
intentional or resulting from gross negligence, it shall be relieved of any
liability for damages hereunder.

ARTICLE IX

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS AND COVENANTS

9.01 Acknowledgment by the Purchaser.

(a) Purchaser and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that:

(i) the representations and warranties of the Company expressly and
specifically set forth in Article IV (together with any representations and
warranties expressly and specifically made by the Stockholders and
Optionholders in their respective Letters of Transmittal and Option
Cancellation Agreements), as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules: (A)
constitute the sole and exclusive representations, warranties, and statements
(including by omission) of any kind or nature, whether written or oral,
expressed or implied, statutory or otherwise (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, relating to quality, quantity, condition, merchantability, fitness for
a particular purpose or conformity to samples) of any of the Company, the
Stockholders, the Optionholders, the Representative or any of their respective
Non-Recourse Parties as to any matter concerning the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any of their respective Subsidiaries or joint ventures or
businesses or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or with respect to the accuracy or
completeness of any information provided to (or otherwise acquired by) the
Purchaser or the Merger Sub or any of their respective Non-Recourse Parties in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any statements, information,
documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to the
Purchaser, the Merger Sub or any of their respective Non-Recourse Parties in
certain "data rooms" or presentations including "management presentations");
and (B) supersede, replace and nullify in every respect the data and
information set forth in any other Contract, instrument, document, material or
statement, whether written or oral, made available to Purchaser, the Merger
Sub or any of their respective Non-Recourse Parties;

(ii) all other representations, warranties and statements of any kind or
nature expressed or implied (including those relating to the Stockholders, the
Optionholders, the future or historical financial condition, results of
operations, prospects, assets or Liabilities of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or the quality, quantity or condition of the assets of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries) are specifically disclaimed by the
Company, the Stockholders, the Optionholders and the Representative; and

(iii) no Seller Indemnified Party will have any Liability or obligation
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any indemnification obligation under
Article X) to Purchaser, the Merger Sub or any other Purchaser Indemnified
Party (and neither the Purchaser, the Merger Sub nor any other Purchaser
Indemnified Party will be entitled to bring any claim against, or to otherwise
seek recourse from, any Seller Indemnified Party) for any Loss or Liability
suffered or incurred by Purchaser, Merger Sub or any other Purchaser
Indemnified Party that arises from any breach of, or any misrepresentation
with respect to, the representations and warranties described in clause (ii)
above that have been so disclaimed by the Company, the Stockholders, the
Optionholders and the Representative.

(b) If the Change of Control Payment Amount exceeds the sum of: (i) the
aggregate amount actually paid by the Purchaser (whether directly or out of
the CIC Escrow Account), the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates
to members of management as change of control payments pursuant to the
agreements set forth on the Change of Control Agreement Annex on or prior to
the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date; plus (ii) the aggregate amount
of any such change of control payments that are not paid on or prior to the
12-month anniversary of the Closing Date but that accrue and become payable on
or prior to such date (such excess, the "Excess Change of Control Amount"),
then the Purchaser will (or will cause the Surviving Corporation to) deliver
to the Paying Agent, for further distribution to the Stockholders and
Optionholders, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Paying Agent within 10 days after the 12-month anniversary
of the Closing Date an amount equal to such Excess Change of Control Amount.
To the extent the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates pays to members of management change of control payments pursuant
to the agreements set forth on the Change of Control Agreement Annex on or
prior to the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date (which for purposes of
this sentence shall include the aggregate amount of any such change of control
payments that are not paid on or prior to the 12-month anniversary of the
Closing Date but that accrue and become payable on or prior to such date),
then the Purchaser will provide written notice to the Representative of any
such payment and the Purchaser and the Representative will cause the Escrow
Agent, including through the execution and delivery of a joint written
instruction, to pay to the Purchaser the amount of such payments (which in no
case will exceed the amount of the CIC Escrow Account plus the Indemnification
Escrow Funds), which payment will be satisfied from the CIC Escrow Account.

9.02 Further Assurances. From and after the Closing Date, upon the request of
either the Representative, the Purchaser, or the Surviving Corporation, each
of the parties hereto shall (and to the extent any of the foregoing actions
are required by or from any Stockholder or Optionholder, each or any such
Stockholder or Optionholder shall) use its reasonable best efforts from time
to time to execute and deliver at the reasonable request of the other parties
such additional documents and instruments, and to take, or refrain from
taking, such other actions, as may be reasonably required to give effect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

9.03 Employees and Employee Benefits.

(a) Salary and Wages. The Purchaser will cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide all Company Employees with at least the same base wages, annual base
salary and 2015 bonus potential (with respect to the Company's 2015 bonus
criteria in effect on the date of this Agreement and disclosed to the
Purchaser) available to each such employee immediately prior to the Closing;
provided, however, that with respect to any Company Employees that are not
U.S. Company Employees (collectively, "Foreign Employees" and each a "Foreign
Employee"), the Purchaser shall adhere to the requirements of applicable
foreign law and any applicable employment Contract entered into by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any Foreign Employee, on the
other hand (each a "Foreign Employment Contract" and collectively, "Foreign
Employment Contracts") to the extent such laws and Foreign Employment
Contracts are more favorable to the Foreign Employees or to the extent the
foregoing provisions violate applicable foreign law or any such Foreign
Employment Contract. Nothing in this Section 9.03(a) will obligate the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary to continue the
employment of any Company Employee for any specific period after the Closing
Date. (b) Employee Benefits. As of the Closing Date, the Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or the applicable Company Subsidiary will either (i) continue to
maintain the U.S. Plans and cause the Company Employees to continue to be
covered under the U.S. Plans and the Non-U.S. Plans, as applicable, to the
same extent covered prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) cause all Company
Employees to be covered by benefit plans and arrangements sponsored by the
Purchaser on terms and conditions no less favorable to the Company Employees
as those provided to similarly situated employees of the Purchaser or the
applicable Company Subsidiary (the "Purchaser Plans"). The Surviving
Corporation will be solely responsible for complying with the requirements of
Section 4980B of the Code with respect to all MandA qualified beneficiaries as
defined in Treas. Reg. §54.4980B 9. Purchaser's commitment to continue
employee benefits for Company Employees who are Foreign Employees shall adhere
to applicable foreign law and any applicable Foreign Employment Contract.

(c) Employee Service Credit. The Purchaser will, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, from and after the Closing Date: (i) give each Company
Employee who is not a Foreign Employee credit under all Purchaser Plans for
such Company Employee's service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing Date, to the same extent recognized by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary as of the Closing Date; (ii) allow such Company Employees
to participate in each Purchaser Plan providing welfare benefits (including
medical, life insurance, long term disability insurance and long term care
insurance) without regard to pre-existing condition limitations, waiting
periods, evidence of insurability or other exclusions or limitations to the
extent such limitations, waiting periods, evidence of insurability or other
exclusions or limitations were waived or satisfied under any corresponding
Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date; and (iii) credit the Company
Employee with any expenses that were incurred under the Plans for purposes of
satisfying any deductibles, co-pays and other applicable limits under any
similar Purchaser Plans. Purchaser's commitment to credit service for Company
Employees who are Foreign Employees shall adhere to applicable foreign law and
any applicable Foreign Employment Contract.

(d) Vacation Pay and Personal Holidays. The Purchaser will cause the Surviving
Corporation or any Company Subsidiary to credit each Company Employee who is
not a Foreign Employee with up to 160 hours of vacation and personal holiday
accrual that such Company Employee is entitled to use but has not used as of
the Closing Date (including any earned vacation or personal holiday pay to be
used in future years), and will assume all Liability for the payment of such
amounts (the "Assumed Vacation Accrual"). On or prior to the Closing Date, the
Company will pay to the Company Employees all accrued vacation and personal
holiday accrual in excess of 160 hours in a lump sum, less all applicable
Taxes. After a Company Employee has used his or her portion of the Assumed
Vacation Accrual, the Company Employee will participate in the vacation and
other paid time off policies of the Purchaser applicable to similarly situated
employees of the Purchaser. Purchaser's commitment to credit paid time off or
other leave for Company Employees who are Foreign Employees shall adhere to
applicable foreign law and any applicable Foreign Employment Contract.

(e) U.S. Plan Terminations. The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all
actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date: (a) the Company's participation in the
Insperity 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan"), provided, however, that before or
after the termination, the Company may adopt amendments to the 401(k) Plan and
take such other actions with respect to the 401(k) Plan as the Company deems
necessary or advisable to maintain the 401(k) Plans' qualified status and to
distribute the Plans' assets in accordance with all applicable Legal
Requirements; and (b) any other U.S. Plan or Non-U.S. Plan requested by the
Purchaser at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date. The Company
shall provide any notice required by Law to Company Employees concerning the
termination of the Company's participation in the 401(k) Plan sufficiently in
advance of the Closing Date that the Surviving Corporation will not be
required to contribute any amounts to the 401(k) Plan on or after the Closing
Date. The Company shall provide the Purchaser evidence of such notices and evidence that the Company's board of directors
has validly adopted resolutions to terminate the Company's participation in
the 401(k) Plan and any other U.S. Plan or Non-U.S. Plan (the form and
substance of which resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of the
Purchaser), effective no later than the date immediately preceding the Closing
Date. In the event that the distributions of assets from the trust of a 401(k)
Plan is reasonably anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender
charges, or other fees to be imposed upon the account of any participant or
beneficiary of such plan or upon the Company or a Company Subsidiary, then the
Company shall take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the
amount of such charges or fees and provide such estimate in writing to the
Purchaser prior to the Closing Date.

(f) No Third Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Section 9.03 are
solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or
former employee, officer, director or consultant, or any other individual
associated therewith, will be regarded for any purpose as a third party
beneficiary of this Section 9.03. In no event will the terms of this Agreement
be deemed to: (i) establish, amend or modify any Plan or any other "employee
benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored
by the Company, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates; (ii) subject to compliance with the other provisions of
this Section 9.03, alter or limit the ability of the Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to amend, modify or
terminate any Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date; or (iii) confer upon any
current or former employee, officer, director or consultant, any right to
employment or continued employment or continued service with the Purchaser,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or
constitute or create an employment agreement with any employee.

9.04 Regulatory Matters.

and without limiting any other provision hereof, each of the Company, the
Purchaser and Merger Sub will (or will cause its Affiliates and

commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions and

to the extent listed on the Authorization Schedule; (E) amending or assigning
existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations; and (F) amending, assigning or terminating
existing licenses or other agreements and entering into such new licenses or

payable in connection with the filings described in clauses (A) and (B) of
this Section 9.04(a)(i).

(ii) furnish the other parties with copies of all documents (except documents
or portions thereof for which confidential treatment has been requested or
given) and correspondence: (A) prepared for submission to any Governmental
Body; and (B) received from any Governmental Body; provided, that, to the
extent that any document (including any filings, communications,
presentations, white papers or other written materials) to be filed or
submitted by any party to any Governmental Body contains any information
relating to any of the other parties, prior to filing or submitting such
document to any Governmental Body, such party will permit the other parties to
review such document and information and will consider in good faith the
suggestions of the other party with respect thereto; and

(iii) cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable efforts to
(and will instruct their respective counsel to cooperate with each other and
use commercially reasonably efforts to) facilitate and expedite the

communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, the Governmental Bodies reviewing the matters described in this Section
9.04; (B) comply promptly with any such inquiry or request and supply to any
Governmental Body without undue delay any additional information requested;
and (C) give prompt notice to the other party of the occurrence of any event
or development or the failure of any event or development to occur following
the date of this Agreement that would or would reasonably be expected to
result in the failure of any condition to the obligations of a party set forth
in Article III to be satisfied.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this Agreement
(i) shall require Purchaser to respond to a Request for Additional Information
and Documentary Material pursuant to the HSR Act (referred to as a "Second
Request"), (ii) shall require Purchaser to litigate or participate in the
litigation of any action or proceeding pursuant to the HSR Act, whether
judicial or administrative, brought by any Governmental Body or appeal any
order (A) challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of
the transaction or seeking to obtain from Purchaser any damages in relation
therewith, or (B) seeking to prohibit or limit in any respect, or place any
conditions on, the ownership or operation by Purchaser of all or any portion

Company or to require any such person to dispose of, license (whether pursuant
to an exclusive or nonexclusive license) or hold separate all or any portion
of Purchaser's business from the business or assets or any product of the
Company, in each case, as a result of or in connection with the transaction,
or (iii) shall require Purchaser to, nor shall the Company without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, (A) agree or proffer to any of the prohibitions,
limitations, conditions or other actions referred to in this Section 9.04(b),
or (B) enter into any settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or
agreement with any Governmental Body in connection with the transaction.

9.05 Disclosure Schedules; Updates. Between the date hereof and the Closing
Date, the Company will supplement or amend the Schedules comprising the
Disclosure Schedules and deliver such supplemented or amended Schedules (each,
an "Schedule Amendment") to the Purchaser with respect to: (a) any matter,
event, condition, fact, circumstance or development that arose prior to the
date hereof that was required to be set forth on the Schedules but was omitted
(the "Existing Information"); and (b) any matter, event, condition, fact,
circumstance or development that arises after the date hereof (other than as a result of or due to a breach of any covenant in this Agreement by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary) that, had it existed on the date hereof,
would have been required to be set forth on the Schedules (the "New
Information"). No Schedule Amendment (or any Existing Information or New
Information contained therein) will be deemed to have amended the Schedules,
to have modified the representations and warranties contained in Article IV
accordingly or to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of representation
and warranty caused thereby or resulting therefrom, and the Purchaser will not
be deemed to have waived any right to indemnification under Article X or right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII by virtue of the closing
condition set forth in Section 3.01(a) or (b) being incapable of being
satisfied with respect to any such misrepresentation or breach; provided,
however, to the extent that such Schedule Amendment (or any Existing
Information or New Information contained therein) causes or results in the
closing condition set forth in Section 3.01(a) or (b) not be satisfied or to
be incapable of being satisfied, then the sole remedy of the Purchaser and
Merger Sub is to terminate this Agreement under Article VIII hereof; provided,
further, that if the Purchaser and the Merger Sub in the Purchaser's sole
discretion elect not to terminate this Agreement and to instead consummate the
Merger, and if (a) the representation or warranty to which the subject matter
of any such written notice specifically relates was as of the date of this
Agreement (x) true and correct in all material respects or (y) in the case of
a representation or warranty that is already subject to "material",
"materiality", "materially", "Material Adverse Change" or other
qualification(s) based on materiality, true and correct in all respects and
(b) the facts and circumstances underlying the matter disclosed in such
written notice arose after the date of this Agreement and such breach was not
the result of any intentional conduct of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, then: (i) the Schedule Amendment (and any Existing Information or
New Information contained therein) will, for all purposes under this Agreement
(including for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of any
representation or warrant for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are
entitled to indemnification under Article X), be deemed to have amended the
Schedules, to have modified the representations and warranties contained in
Article IV accordingly and to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of
representation or warranty caused thereby or resulting therefrom; and (ii) the
Purchaser and the other Purchaser Indemnified Parties will be deemed to have
waived any right to indemnification under Article X with respect to such
misrepresentation or breach of representation or warranty that is deemed to be
cured pursuant to clause (i) above.

9.06 Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Notices and Consents. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, from the date of this Agreement to the
Closing, or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII,
each of the parties hereto (other than the Representative) shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, to
file or cause to be filed all documents, to give or cause to be given all
notices to Governmental Bodies or other Persons, to obtain or cause to be
obtained all authorizations, consents, waivers, approvals, permits or orders
from Governmental Bodies or other Persons, and to do or cause to be done all
other things necessary, proper or advisable, in order to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement (including satisfaction, but
not waiver, of the closing conditions set forth in Article III).

INDEMNIFICATION

[Intentionally omitted - see Section 12.04(j).]

ARTICLE XI

TAX MATTERS

11.01 Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns. Subject to the provisions of
Section 11.06, the Purchaser will timely prepare and file, or will cause to be
prepared and filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period that are due
after the Closing Date. The Purchaser will prepare such Tax Returns consistent
with past practices of the Company (unless otherwise required by applicable
Law) and will provide the Representative the right to review and comment on
such Tax Returns no later than 30 days prior to the due date for filing such
Tax Returns. With respect to Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, the
Purchaser will, subject to Section 11.09, make all such changes as are
reasonably requested by the Representative, so long as such changes are not
likely to result in an increase in the Tax liabilities of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries following the Closing Date. With respect to such Tax
Returns, the Purchaser will not file any such Tax Returns without the
Representative's consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Purchaser agrees that unless otherwise required by
Law, the Transaction Tax Deductions shall be claimed pursuant to Treas. Reg.
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1) (and not pursuant to the "next day rule" of Treas.
Reg. 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)). Except to the extent that any Taxes shown as due
on such Tax Returns were taken into account as an adjustment to, or component
of the purchase price hereunder or were previously paid by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to a Governmental Body on or prior to the Closing Date (or
the payment of which pursuant to this Section 11.01 would otherwise result in
a duplicative recovery for the Purchaser); the Stockholders and Optionholders
will pay to the Purchaser:

(i) the amount of Taxes (if any) that are shown as due and payable on a Tax
Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on or prior to the Closing Date
that is filed by the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 11.01; and

(ii) the amount of Taxes (if any) that are due and payable and allocated to
the Stockholders and Optionholders as determined under Section 11.02 for a Tax
Return for a Straddle Period;

which in each case will be net of all estimated taxes paid on or prior to the
Closing Date and in each case five (5) days prior to the due date for Taxes to
be reported on such Tax Returns.

All amounts required to be paid by the Stockholders and Optionholders will be
paid by the Stockholders and Optionholders on a several, and not joint, basis,
pro rata based on such Stockholder's or Optionholder's respective Allocation
Percentage of the amount due. The Purchaser will cause any amounts shown to be
due on such Tax Returns to be timely remitted to the applicable Governmental
Body before such Taxes are due.

11.02 Straddle Periods. The Purchaser will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, close the Taxable year of the Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date. In any case where applicable Law does not
permit the Company or any Company Subsidiaries to close its Taxable year on
the Closing Date, then Taxes, if any, attributable to a Straddle Period will
be allocated: (a) to the Stockholders and Optionholders for the period up to
and including the Closing Date; and (b) to the Purchaser for the period
subsequent to the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of
any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes for the portion of the Straddle
Period that includes the Closing Date: (i) in the case of real property,
personal property and other Taxes not imposed on the basis of income or
receipts, will be based on a daily proration of such Taxes over the applicable
Straddle Period; and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes will be based on an
interim closing of the books of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of
the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable
period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary holds a beneficial interest will be deemed to terminate
as of the close of business on the Closing Date).

11.03 Amended Tax Returns. Except to the extent required by Law or as
specifically contemplated by this Agreement, without the prior written consent
of the Representative (not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed), none of the Purchaser, Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries
or Affiliates will file, or cause to be filed: (a) any restatement or
amendment of, modification to, or claim for refund relating to, any Tax Returns of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; (b) any Tax Return of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period in any
jurisdiction where Tax Returns have not previously been filed by such entity;
or (c) any Tax election (and will make, modify or terminate no Tax election)
that would affect a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

11.04 Closing Date Course of Business. For the portion of the Closing Date
after the time of Closing, other than transactions expressly contemplated
hereby, the Purchaser will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to carry on its business only in the ordinary course in the same
manner as previously conducted. Except as expressly contemplated in this
Agreement, the Purchaser will not, and will not permit the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to, take any action after the close of
business on the Closing Date which could increase the liability of the
Stockholders or Optionholders for Taxes (including any liability of the
Stockholders and Optionholders to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
for Taxes pursuant to this Agreement.

11.05 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Subject to Section 11.03, the Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation, their respective Subsidiaries and the Representative
will cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
parties, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns (including any Tax
Returns that the Purchaser will file pursuant to Section 11.01 that relate to
Pre-Closing Tax Periods), the filing of any amended Tax Return for a period
prior to (or including) the Closing Date, any Tax audits, Tax proceedings or
other Tax-related claims, the authorization and execution of any appropriate
powers of attorney to accomplish the foregoing, allowing the Representative to
review Tax Returns to determine or verify the proper amounts payable as
refunds hereunder, and any mechanisms or payment processes reasonably
requested by the Representative to pay refunds to the Stockholders and
Optionholders as provided herein. Such cooperation will include, upon a
party's reasonable request, providing records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such matters, making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information, and explaining
any materials provided pursuant to this Article XI. The Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries will not destroy or
dispose of any Tax work papers, schedules or other materials and documents
supporting Tax Returns of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for Pre-
Closing Tax Periods until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date,
without the prior written consent of Representative, and before any
disposition or destruction of such materials at any time, the Purchaser will
give 30 days prior written notice of any such proposed disposition or
destruction to the Representative, and the Representative shall have the
right, in its sole discretion, to take possession of such materials and
documents.

11.06 Tax Refunds. The Stockholders and Optionholders will be entitled to
receive from the Purchaser, Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries all
Pre-Closing Tax Refunds, including any interest paid thereon by a Governmental
Body, to the extent such Pre-Closing Tax Refunds were not otherwise included
in the computation of Final Closing Merger Consideration paid to the
Stockholders and Optionholders pursuant to Section 2.03 or otherwise taken
into account hereunder; provided, however, that any Pre-Closing Tax Refunds
shall be for the account of Purchaser to the extent attributable (determined
on a marginal basis) to the carryback from a Post-Closing Tax Period of items
of loss, deduction or credit, or other Tax items, of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any of their respective Affiliates, including the Purchaser).
Promptly upon receipt of any such Pre-Closing Tax Refunds, and in no event
later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt by the Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, the Purchaser will, and
will cause the Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries to, deliver and
pay over to the Stockholders and Optionholders, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount equal to the amount of such Pre-Closing
Tax Refunds, including any interest thereon that was paid by a Governmental
Body. Upon a request from the Representative, the Purchaser will, as soon as
is reasonably practicable, cause the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries
to file an amended Tax Return or application for Tax refund with respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period in order to obtain a Pre-Closing Tax Refund that the Stockholders and Optionholders are entitled to pursuant to this
Section 11.06, and the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and their
Subsidiaries will execute all other documents, take reasonable additional
actions and otherwise reasonably cooperate as may be necessary for the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and their Subsidiaries to perfect their
rights in and obtain the Pre-Closing Tax Refunds contemplated by this Section
11.06. In addition, the Purchaser will use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Surviving Corporation to prepare and file IRS Form 4466 in respect of the
Company's tax year ending on the Closing Date no later than thirty 30 days
after the Closing Date and to file IRS Form 1139 for any eligible carryback
periods of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries no later than 30 days
after filing the Company's income Tax Return for the tax period ending on the
Closing Date. The Purchaser will provide the Representative the right to
review and comment on such Form 4466 and 1139 no later than five (5) Business
Days prior to the filing date for such forms. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing set forth in this Agreement shall require the Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation to claim a deduction with respect to any Transaction Tax
Deduction to the extent such deduction is not properly deductible for Income
Tax purposes. Any refunds received as a result of the claiming of such
deductions that are Pre-Closing Tax Refunds shall be paid in accordance with
this Section 11.06.

11.07 Transfer Taxes. The Purchaser will be liable for and will hold the
Company, the Stockholders, the Optionholders and the Representative harmless
against any transfer, sales, use, value added, excise, stock transfer, stamp,
recording, registration and any similar Taxes ("Transfer Taxes") that become
payable in connection with the Merger and other transactions contemplated
hereby. The Purchaser will, at its expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, and if required
by applicable Law, the Stockholders and Optionholders and the Purchaser will
join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The
applicable parties will cooperate in filing such forms and documents with
respect to such Transfer Taxes.

11.08 No 338 Elections. None of the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Affiliates will make an election under Section 338 of the Code
with respect to the purchase of the Company Stock.

11.09 Controversies.

(a) The Purchaser will promptly notify the Representative upon receipt by the
Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser (including the Surviving
Corporation and any Company Subsidiary after the Closing Date) of written
notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits, proceedings or similar
events with respect to Taxes for which the Stockholders and Optionholders may
be liable under this Agreement (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit,
proceeding or similar event, a "Tax Matter"); provided, however, the failure
to give such notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder
except to the extent the indemnifying party has been materially prejudiced as
a result of such failure. As long as the Representative notifies the
Purchaser, within 30 days of receiving the notice provided by the Purchaser
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 11.09 of its intent to control
a Tax Matter, the Representative, at the sole expense of the Stockholders and
Optionholders, will have the authority to represent the interests of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to any Tax Matter for a
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date before the IRS, any
other taxing authority, any other governmental agency or authority or any
court or other Governmental Body and will have the right to control the
defense, compromise or other resolution of any such Tax Matter, including
responding to inquiries, filing Tax Returns and contesting, defending against
and resolving any assessment for additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency
or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, any such Tax Matter;
provided, however, that the Representative will not enter into any settlement
of or otherwise compromise any such Tax Matter that adversely affects the Tax
liability of the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of the foregoing for any period ending after the
Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. The Purchaser will be permitted, at the sole expense
of the Purchaser, to participate in any Tax Matter controlled by the
Representative. The Representative will: (i) keep the Purchaser fully and
timely informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any
such Tax Matter; (ii) promptly provide the Purchaser with all information,
notices and other communications received with respect to such Tax Matter
(including any document requests, notices or proposed adjustment or similar
reports or notices of deficiencies related to such Tax Matter); (iii) provide
drafts of all memoranda, briefs and other communications to be filed with
respect to such Tax Matter for review and comment by the Purchaser; (iv) in
good faith, allow the Purchaser to make comments to the Representative
regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such proceeding; and (v)
permit representatives of the Purchaser to attend and participate in any
meetings or other conferences (including telephone conferences) with the IRS
or other taxing authority with respect to any such Tax Matter.

(b) If the Representative does not elect to control a Tax Matter pursuant to
clause (a) of this Section 11.09, the Purchaser shall have the sole right, at
its expense, to control any Tax Matter; provided, however, that neither the
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates will enter into any settlement of or
otherwise compromise any Tax Matter for which the Stockholders and the
Optionholders may have Liability under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Representative will be permitted, at the
sole expense of the Stockholders and Optionholders, to participate in any Tax
Matter controlled by the Purchaser. The Purchaser will: (i) keep the
Representative fully and timely informed with respect to the commencement,
status and nature of any such Tax Matter; (ii) promptly provide Representative
with all information, notices and other communications received with respect
to such Tax Matter (including without limitation any document requests,
notices of proposed adjustment or similar reports or notices of deficiencies
related to such Tax Matter); (iii) provide drafts of all memoranda, briefs and
other communications to be filed with respect to such Tax Matter for review
and comment by Representative; (iv) in good faith allow the Representative to
make comments to the Purchaser regarding the conduct of or positions taken in
any such proceeding; and (v) permit representatives of the Representative to
attend and participate in any meetings or other conferences (including
telephone conferences) with the IRS or other taxing authority with respect to
any such Tax Matter.

11.10 Accounting Firm. Any dispute as to any matter covered by this Article XI
will be resolved by the Accounting Firm, and the past practices of the Company
will be the Accounting Firm's standard for resolution of any such dispute
whenever applicable to the extent permitted by Law. The fees and expenses of
the Accounting Firm in respect of resolution of any such dispute will be borne
equally by the Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and
Optionholders), on the one hand, and the Surviving Corporation, on the other
hand.

11.11 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Any payments under this Article XI
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by Law.

12.06 Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and all of the
provisions hereof will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except that
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder may be assigned or delegated by either the Purchaser or the Company
without the prior written consent of the other party and, following the
Closing, without the prior written consent of the Representative.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser may assign this Agreement and any
of its rights and obligations hereunder without the consent of the Company or
the Representative, as the case may be, (i) to an Affiliate without being
relieved of its obligations hereunder and (ii) in connection with a merger,
consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation if the assignee assumes all of the
obligations of the Purchaser hereunder in writing. Any assignment of this
Agreement or any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder not
permitted under this Section 12.06 shall be null and void ab initio. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing expressed or referred to in this
Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement, any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement; provided, that
from and after the Closing, Section 7.02 and Article X are made for the
benefit of the Persons set forth therein and from and after the Closing, all
such Persons will be entitled to enforce the provisions and to avail
themselves of the benefits and remedies for any breach of such provisions, all
to the same extent as if such Persons were parties to this Agreement. 12.07 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable Law, such provision will be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

12.08 Relationship of the Parties. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to
constitute the parties hereto as joint venturers, alter egos, partners or
participants in an unincorporated business or other separate entity, nor,
except as expressly and specifically set forth in Section 12.14, in any manner
create any principal agent, fiduciary or other special relationship between
the parties hereto. No party will have any duties (including fiduciary duties)
towards any other party hereto except as specifically set forth herein.

12.09 Amendment and Waiver. Except as provided herein, any provision of this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits and annexes hereto may be
amended or waived only in a writing signed by the Purchaser, the Company and
the Representative. For purposes of this Section 12.09, the Stockholders and
Optionholders have agreed that any amendment of this Agreement consented to by
the Representative shall be binding on and enforceable against them, whether
or not they have signed this Agreement or such amendment. No waiver of any
provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof will extend to or affect
in any way any other provision or prior or subsequent breach or default.

12.10 Complete Agreement. This Agreement and the other agreements,
instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection
herewith (including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete
agreement between the parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or between the parties hereto, written or
oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way,
including that certain offer letter, dated October 30, 2015, by and between
the Company and the Purchaser, as amended.

12.11 Headings and Information. The headings of the sections and paragraphs of
this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and will

12.14 Representative.

(a) Effective upon and by virtue of the Stockholder Approval and the
consummation of the Merger, and without any further act of any of the
Stockholders or Optionholders, the Representative is hereby irrevocably
appointed as the representative, agent, proxy, and attorney in fact (coupled
with an interest) for all the Stockholders and Optionholders for all purposes
under this Agreement including the full power and authority on the
Stockholders' and Optionholders' behalf:

(i) to consummate the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the
other agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed
in connection herewith;

(ii) to negotiate claims and disputes arising under, or relating to, this
Agreement and the other agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated
hereby or executed in connection herewith (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the adjustment to the Closing Merger Consideration contemplated by
Section 2.03 and claims for indemnification under Article X);

(iii) subject to the terms of this Agreement, to receive and disburse to, or
caused to be received or disbursed to, any Stockholder or Optionholder any
funds received on behalf of such Stockholder or Optionholder under this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any portion of the Merger
Consideration) or otherwise;

(iv) to withhold any amounts received on behalf of any Stockholder or
Optionholder pursuant to this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any portion of the Merger Consideration) or to satisfy (on behalf of
the Stockholders and Optionholders) any and all obligations or Liabilities of
any Stockholder, Optionholder or the Representative in the performance of any
of their commitments hereunder (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the satisfaction of payment obligations (on behalf of the Stockholders and
Optionholders) in connection with the adjustment to the Closing Merger
Consideration contemplated by Section 2.03 or the indemnification of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties under Article X);

(v) to execute and deliver any amendment or waiver to this Agreement and the
other agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed
in connection herewith (without the prior approval of any Stockholder or
Optionholder); and

(vi) to take all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of any Stockholder
or Optionholder in connection with this Agreement and the other agreements,
instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection
herewith.

Such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable
without the consent of the Representative and will survive the death,
incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of each Stockholder and
Optionholder. All decisions and actions made or taken by the Representative
will be binding upon each Stockholder and Optionholder, and no Stockholder or
Optionholder will have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise
contest the same. The Representative will have no duties or obligations
hereunder, including any fiduciary duties, except those set forth herein, and
such duties and obligations will be determined solely by the express
provisions of this Agreement.

(a) Effective upon and by virtue of the Stockholder Approval, and without any
further act of any of the Stockholders or Optionholders, the Representative
and its Non-Recourse Parties will be indemnified, held harmless and reimbursed
by each Stockholder and Optionholder severally (based on each Stockholder's
and Optionholder's Allocation Percentage), and not jointly, against all
losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions,
fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and
experts and their staffs and all expenses of document location, duplication
and shipment) (collectively, the "Representative Losses") arising out of or in
connection with the Representative's execution and performance of this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such
Representative Loss is suffered and incurred; provided, that in the event that
any Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Representative, the
Representative will reimburse the Stockholders and Optionholders the amount of
such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Any such Representative Losses shall (i)
first, be recovered by the Representative from the Representative Holdback
Amount and (ii) second, be recovered by the Representative from the escrow
amounts held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, but solely at such time and to
the extent any remaining amounts are otherwise required to be distributed to
the Stockholders and Optionholders; provided, that while this Section 12.14(b)
requires the Representative to be paid first from the Representative Holdback
Amount and second from the escrow amounts held pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement that are required to be distributed to the Stockholders and
Optionholders, this Section 12.14(b) does not relieve the Stockholders and
Optionholders from their obligation to promptly pay the amount of such
Representative Losses in excess of the amount actually recovered (or available
to be recovered) from the Representative Holdback Amount and escrow amounts
held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement that are required to be distributed to
the Stockholders and Optionholders as they are suffered or incurred, nor does
this Section 12.14(b) prevent the Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise in respect of such excess amounts. In no
event will the Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf
of the Stockholders and Optionholders or otherwise. The Stockholders and
Optionholders acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities will
survive the resignation of or removal of the Representative or the termination
of this Agreement.

(b) Neither the Representative nor any of its Non-Recourse Parties will incur
any Liability to any Stockholder or Optionholder by virtue of the failure or
refusal of the Representative or any of its Non-Recourse Parties for any reason to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or relating to the performance of their duties hereunder
and under any agreement ancillary hereto, except for actions or omissions
constituting Fraud.

(c) The Representative Holdback Amount will be held by the Representative and
used for the purpose of paying directly, or reimbursing the Representative
for, any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements
ancillary hereto. The Representative will hold these funds separate from its
corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any
other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available
to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The Stockholders and
Optionholders will not receive any interest or earnings on the Representative
Holdback Amount and each irrevocably transfers and assigns to the
Representative any ownership right that he, she or it may otherwise have had
in any such interest or earnings. The Representative will not be liable for
any loss of principal of the Representative Holdback Amount other than as a
result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. Contemporaneous with or
soon as practicable following the completion of the Representative's duties,
the Representative will deliver the balance of the Representative Holdback
Amount to the Paying Agent for further distribution to the Stockholders and
Optionholders based on their respective Allocation Percentage. For tax
purposes, the Representative Holdback Amount will be treated as having been
received and voluntarily set aside by the Stockholders and Optionholders at
the time of Closing.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the
Representative and its Affiliates will not be liable for any Loss to any
Stockholder or Optionholder for any action taken or not taken by the
Representative or for any act or omission taken or not taken in reliance upon
the actions taken or not taken or decisions, communications or writings made,
given or executed by the Purchaser or the Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation.

(e) Except as may have been expressly and specifically agreed to in writing by
a Stockholder or Optionholder, on the one hand, and Barnes and Thornburg LLP
("BT LLP"), on the other hand: (i) BT LLP has not and is not representing, and
will not be deemed to have represented any Stockholder or Optionholder in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) BT LLP has not
and is not providing any advice or counsel (including legal advice or
counsel), and will not be deemed to have provided counsel or advice, to any
Stockholder or Optionholder in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each Stockholder and Optionholder agrees that BT LLP may represent the
Representative and its Affiliates in any matter related to the transaction
completed hereby including matters which maybe adverse to such Stockholders or
Optionholders and, in furtherance thereof, each Stockholder and Optionholder
consents to, and waives, without limitation, restriction or condition of any
kind, any actual or potential conflict or other actual or potential objection
with respect to BT LLP's representation of the Representative and its
Affiliates in any matter related to the transaction completed hereby.

12.15 Legal Representation. Following consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, BT LLP may serve as counsel to each and any of the
Representative, the Stockholders, the Optionholders and their respective Non-
Recourse Parties, in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement notwithstanding such representation or any continued
representation of any other Person (including the Company and its Affiliates),
and each of the parties (on behalf of itself and each of its Non-Recourse
Parties) hereto consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising
therefrom. The decision to represent any of the Representative, the
Stockholders, the Optionholders and their respective Non-Recourse Parties will
be solely that of BT LLP. Any privilege attaching as a result of BT LLP
representing the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will survive the Closing and will
remain in effect; provided, that such privilege from and after the Closing
will be assigned to and controlled by the Representative. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees to take the steps necessary to ensure that any privilege attaching as a result
of BT LLP representing the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will survive the Closing,
remain in effect and be assigned to and controlled by the Representative. As
to any privileged attorney client communications between BT LLP and the
Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the
"Privileged Communications"), the Purchaser, the Merger Sub and the Company
(including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation), together with any
of their respective Affiliates, successors or assigns, agree that no such
party may use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications in any action or
claim against or involving any of the parties hereto or any of their
respective Non-Recourse Parties after the Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between the Purchaser, the
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries and a third
party other than a party to this Agreement after the Closing, the Merger Sub,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of the Privileged
Communications and other confidential or privileged communications to such
third party. The Surviving Corporation further agrees that, on its own behalf
and on behalf of its Subsidiaries, BT LLP retention by the Surviving
Corporation or any of its respective Subsidiaries will be deemed completed and
terminated without any further action by any Person effective as of the
Closing.

acknowledge that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties' right to any payment to be

would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not

any such damages. Therefore, it is accordingly agreed that each party will be
entitled to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of any other
party, in any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive
relief will be granted in connection therewith. Any party seeking an

provide any bond or other security in connection therewith and any such remedy
will be in addition and not in substitution for any other remedy to which such

WHEREAS, Section 12.09 of the Merger Agreement provides that the Merger
Agreement may be amended only in a writing signed by the Purchaser, the

valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

A.

|

The second to last sentence of Section 2.01 of the Merger Agreement is hereby
deleted and replaced in its entirety with the following sentence:

provided herein. The Merger Agreement is ratified and confirmed and shall

concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of
this Amendment, and all claims and disputes arising hereunder or thereunder or
in connection herewith or therewith, whether purporting to be sound in
contract or tort, or at law or in equity, will be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect
to any choice of Law or conflict of Law rules or provisions (whether of the
